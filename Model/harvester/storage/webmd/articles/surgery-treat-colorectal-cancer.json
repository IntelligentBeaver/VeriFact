A colostomy is when the end of your colon is connected to a stoma, and an ileostomy is when the stoma is attached to the end of the small intestine. Your stoma may be permanent if waste can’t go through its normal route after surgery. Temporary stomas keep stool away from a damaged or recently operated area while you heal.

To replace your rectum and provide a place to store waste before going to the bathroom after a total proctocolectomy, your doctor may make a pouch out of the end of the small intestine, called the ileum. There are different forms, named after the shape that your doctor puts the small intestine in before sewing or stapling it to make a pouch. The most common form is the \"J\" pouch. This is a complicated procedure, and it doesn’t always work. To improve your chances, your doctor will make a temporary ileostomy so the pouch won’t have to handle waste while it heals. A temporary ileostomy can usually be reversed after about 2 to 3 months.",

This is also known as a \"continent ileostomy.\" Unlike a usual ileostomy, which is attached to a bag outside your body, the K pouch provides a holding area for waste and adds a nipple valve to keep it from leaking. You empty the pouch by inserting a stiff catheter through the stoma. This type of pouch isn’t very popular among surgeons because the valve often comes undone or slips, leading to another operation to repair it. The surgery is very complex, and long-term problems are common.",

Depending on how far your cancer has spread, you could have those tumors removed at the same time as your colon surgery.

A colostomy is when the end of your colon is connected to a stoma, and an ileostomy is when the stoma is attached to the end of the small intestine. Your stoma may be permanent if waste can’t go through its normal route after surgery. Temporary stomas keep stool away from a damaged or recently operated area while you heal. The waste that comes out of a stoma is collected in a bag.",
            "Fecal diversion. This procedure makes an ileostomy or colostomy. It’s often a temporary measure to allow healing of an infection, surgery, or long-term inflammation .",
            "Ileal (J) pouch. To replace your rectum and provide a place to store waste before going to the bathroom after a total proctocolectomy, your doctor may make a pouch out of the end of the small intestine, called the ileum. There are different forms, named after the shape that your doctor puts the small intestine in before sewing or stapling it to make a pouch. The most common form is the \"J\" pouch. This is a complicated procedure, and it doesn’t always work. To improve your chances, your doctor will make a temporary ileostomy so the pouch won’t have to handle waste while it heals. A temporary ileostomy can usually be reversed after about 2 to 3 months.",
            "K pouch. This is also known as a \"continent ileostomy.\" Unlike a usual ileostomy, which is attached to a bag outside your body, the K pouch provides a holding area for waste and adds a nipple valve to keep it from leaking. You empty the pouch by inserting a stiff catheter through the stoma. This type of pouch isn’t very popular among surgeons because the valve often comes undone or slips, leading to another operation to repair it. The surgery is very complex, and long-term problems are common.",
            "Liver surgery. In between 60% and 70% of colon cancer cases, the cancer spreads to the liver. Depending on how far your cancer has spread, you could have those tumors removed at the same time as your colon surgery. This can be combined with chemotherapy, and it can lessen complications and shorten recovery time."
