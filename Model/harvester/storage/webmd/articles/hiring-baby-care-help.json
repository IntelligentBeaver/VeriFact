          "text": "After you choose your child care specialist, make sure you both are clear about house rules and job expectations. Having a written agreement is a good idea. A newborn care specialist is there to help make your home baby-friendly, which means you don’t have to do a lot of prep work before her arrival. But she will need a place to rest that is close to the nursery if she will be spending the night. An au pair or live-in nanny needs her own bedroom, and preferably her own bathroom. If you have older children, enlist their help in decorating the room. It’s also nice to find out the types of drinks and snacks your child care provider prefers so you can have a few on hand to make her feel at home. Remember, you are the employer, as well as the parent. It is up to you to guide your employee so that your children receive the loving care they deserve and you get the help that you need.",
