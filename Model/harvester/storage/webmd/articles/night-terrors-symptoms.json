The child sits up in bed and screams, appearing awake but is confused, disoriented, and unresponsive to stimuli. Although the child seems to be awake, the child does not seem to be aware of the parent's presence and usually does not talk. The child may thrash around in bed and does not respond to comfort by the parents.",

        "If the child does awaken during a night terror, only small pieces of the episode may be recalled. Usually, the child does not remember the episode upon waking in the morning."
