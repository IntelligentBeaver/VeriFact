For the test, you fast for 8 hours and then have blood drawn to establish your fasting glucose level . Depending on the type of test you're taking, you'll have blood drawn again after 1 hour, 2 hours, or 3 hours. The risks of the tests are minimal, and you can go back to your normal routine right afterward."
