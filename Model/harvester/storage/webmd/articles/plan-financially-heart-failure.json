        "By Rhonda E. Monroe, as told to Sarah Ludwig Rausch I was diagnosed with heart failure (HF) 18 years ago, and I’ve been advocating for myself from the very beginning. It started with a week of emergency room and doctor office visits to convince the doctors that I was having a heart attack . A few months later, I was diagnosed with heart failure. Later, I held a press conference from my hospital bed when no one wanted to do the heart surgery I desperately needed. (It worked.) Now, advocacy has become my life’s work. I’m on the advocacy committee for the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), and I’ve launched my own niche advocacy organization called BOOST (Better Outcomes Optimal Scientific Therapies). As a former economist and research analyst, BOOST has given me the chance to combine my educational background with my passion. Heart failure is a chronic condition, which means the treatment is ongoing – and so are the expenses. If you or a loved one has been recently diagnosed, it’s helpful to know what sorts of costs may come up."

        "At a minimum, you’ll have medication expenses. You’ll be prescribed one or more of the drugs that are considered “guideline-directed medical therapies” in the current guidelines for managing HF. This could include beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, SGLT2 inhibitors, or MRAs. It often includes other treatments such as diuretics (water pills) and oxygen, too. Hospital bills: Unfortunately, HF is usually diagnosed in the hospital, so hospital bills are often a major expense. This could include an ambulance bill, too. If you have more serious HF, you may need a device such as a ventricular assist device (VAD) or even a professional caregiver. There can be surprising expenses that come up, as well. For example: Occupational therapy: Some people with HF have a hard time cooking and bathing themselves. You may need occupational therapy to help you set up your house so you can take care of yourself more easily. Lifestyle changes: You’ll need to make some adjustments to your lifestyle, such as eating a healthy diet and getting active. Healthier eating choices are more expensive than picking up a fast food burger. Cardiac rehabilitation – a program that involves physical activity and education – is another possible expense. Even if your insurance pays for it, you may have to pay a copay every time you go in."
