Neurotransmitters are brain chemicals that send specific messages from one brain cell to another. While only a small percentage of all serotonin -- 1% to 2% -- is located in the brain, this neurotransmitter is believed to play a vital role in mediating moods.",

An increased level of serotonin in the brain is associated with a calming, anxiety -reducing effect. In some cases, it's also associated with drowsiness. A stable serotonin level in the brain is associated with a positive mood state or feeling good over a period of time. Lack of exercise and inactivity can aggravate low serotonin levels."
