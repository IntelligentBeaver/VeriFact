        "If you have advanced GIST, there’s at least a 53% chance you’ll be alive 5 years after your diagnosis. But it’s hard to predict how this cancer will affect you. Things like your age, overall health, and how well you respond to treatment all play a role in your survival rate. Standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy don’t work as well on GIST tumors. But there are a growing number of targeted therapies approved to treat this kind of cancer. You may have more treatment choices in the future. For now, let your doctor know if you’re interested in joining a clinical trial. Those are studies where you can try out new drugs that aren’t available to the general public yet. You’ll find more information about trials for GIST cancer through ClinicalTrials.gov or GIST Support International."
