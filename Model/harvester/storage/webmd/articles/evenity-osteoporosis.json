A separate condition, osteoporosis , means that someone has very low bone density for their age and is at an increased risk for breaking a bone ( fracture ) or has already broken a bone. Some people who are diagnosed with osteoporosis have experienced a type of fracture called a fragility fracture, which means that they broke a bone during an accident that wouldn’t normally be expected to break a bone (such as falling from a standing position)."
