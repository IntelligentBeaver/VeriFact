It can harden and form bile duct stones, which are painful and can get infected. Eventually, bile can back up inside your liver and cause scars. You can take medicine to clear the bile out of your liver and reduce scarring. But if you don't treat PBC or it gets worse, you could have complications. These are the most common PBC complications and how to manage them."
