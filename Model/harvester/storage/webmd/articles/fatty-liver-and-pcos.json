The hormone imbalance caused by PCOS often increases insulin levels, a hormone that helps control blood sugar. Too much insulin can make the body store fat in places it doesn’t belong, including the liver. This can lead to a condition called steatotic liver disease (SLD), previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Researchers are still studying the link between the two diseases, but they suspect that the hormonal changes in PCOS contribute to liver inflammation and other problems related to SLD."
