        "Alisha Andrews-Simmons was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2017 at the age of 28. She learned that she had papillary thyroid cancer , the most common type. Up to 85% of people who get differentiated thyroid cancer have this one. Fortunately, papillary thyroid cancer is very treatable and has an over 99% 5-year survival rate. But it has still had a dramatic impact on Andrews-Simmons’s life. Here’s what her treatment journey has looked like and what she wants others to know about differentiated thyroid cancer."

She was immediately sent for an ultrasound , which revealed several suspicious lumps. “There were two that concerned my doctors because of their size,” she recalls. A thyroid biopsy revealed that she had papillary thyroid cancer. While it was initially a shock, when she looked back, Andrews-Simmons says there were definite signs. “I worked in my state senate, where I was go-go-go all the time,” she says. “I assumed I was always exhausted because I was constantly running around.

Since her thyroid was removed, she needed to go on levothyroxine , or synthetic thyroid hormone. But Andrews-Simmons wasn’t quite in the clear yet.

She then had to get three injections of a substance called thyrogen to raise levels of thyroid hormones in her body. But the real shock came the day of treatment. “I was brought into a room by staff in full hazmat gear, including gloves and lead vests,” she recalls. Once there, she had to swallow two radioactive pills at once. “At one point, I tried to take one out of my mouth and they freaked out,” she says. “They didn’t want any exposure to these medicines whatsoever.” After that, she had to stay in an isolated, shielded hospital room for a couple of days, and once she went home, she remained in isolation for another week."

During that time, she often had fatigue so severe she’d spend days in bed. Her thyroid hormone levels also required close monitoring in 2021 during her pregnancy. Andrews-Simmons now takes a slew of over-the-counter supplements that include selenium, zinc, and vitamin D. “When you no longer have a thyroid, you’re more susceptible to vitamin deficiencies because your body simply can’t absorb nutrients as well as it used to,” she explains. She also avoids soy since it can interfere with her thyroid medication. Andrews-Simmons is grateful for her life now, which includes a fulfilling job, a loving husband, and two beautiful children.

Take it one day at a time. “Thyroid cancer is definitely not a death sentence, but it’s a major life adjustment,” she says. “Moving forward, your life will never be the same. Try to nourish yourself during this process, and give yourself time to heal.” One of the most important things you can do is accept your body as it is post-cancer, Andrews-Simmons adds. “It’s like wanting your high school body back – it just won’t happen,” she says. “I need more rest than I did before. When I’m tired, I sit down and make a list of things I can remove from my plate so I can get the quality of life that I need.” Andrews-Simmons still has days where she feels wiped or she’s anxious that her cancer may someday return. “I remind myself that I’m human and it’s OK to feel this way,” she says. “But I try to focus on the things that are important to me, like my family, rather than dwell on things I can’t control.

Take it one day at a time. “Thyroid cancer is definitely not a death sentence, but it’s a major life adjustment,” she says. “Moving forward, your life will never be the same. Try to nourish yourself during this process, and give yourself time to heal.” One of the most important things you can do is accept your body as it is post-cancer, Andrews-Simmons adds. “It’s like wanting your high school body back – it just won’t happen,” she says. “I need more rest than I did before. When I’m tired, I sit down and make a list of things I can remove from my plate so I can get the quality of life that I need.” Andrews-Simmons still has days where she feels wiped or she’s anxious that her cancer may someday return. “I remind myself that I’m human and it’s OK to feel this way,” she says. “But I try to focus on the things that are important to me, like my family, rather than dwell on things I can’t control. It’s given me a healthier perspective on life.”"
