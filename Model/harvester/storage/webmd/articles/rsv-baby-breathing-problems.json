        "The virus known as RSV can cause serious breathing problems in infants. Parents need to be able to recognize the signs, says Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, because RSV infections seem to be on the rise. The hospital posted this video online to show parents exactly how this labored breathing might look and sound:",
        "Notice the fast belly breathing, grunting, and wheezing, all signs of breathing problems linked to RSV. Call your doctor right away if you notice your baby breathing this way.",
        "RSV doesn’t cause breathing problems in most children. In fact, almost all kids will have an RSV infection at least once before age 2. For most, it’s no big deal. Any symptoms -- sneezing, runny nose, fever, coughing -- usually go away in a week or two.",
        "But in some children, especially babies younger than 6 months or those with other health issues, RSV is more likely to lead to serious lung illnesses like pneumonia or bronchiolitis. (Ask your doctor if your baby is at a higher risk.)"
