        "Genomes are made of DNA. Each of your cells has a copy of your genome packed inside of it. You can think of it like an instruction manual or recipe book. The genome has all the instructions or “recipes” your body needs to work and look the way it does.",
        "The human genome is written in a series of 3 billion DNA bases of four different types. Each base can be represented by one of four “letters” in the DNA “alphabet.” Most of your DNA will look just like that of any other person. But tiny differences in the spelling or sequence of those letters in thousands of genes across your genome explain, in part, what makes you unique.",
        "Viruses have genomes, too. A virus genome can be made of DNA or a similar molecule called RNA. Compared to your genome, a virus genome is tiny. For example, coronaviruses such as the one that causes COVID-19 have an RNA genome that’s about 30,000 letters long (that’s 100,000 times smaller than the human genome). The genome of influenza or flu virus is even shorter at about 13,500 RNA letters.",
        "Not all viruses make people sick. But the genomes of those that do have all the instructions needed for them to infect our cells, make more copies of themselves and spread. Small differences in those instructions can make different viruses or different variants or strains of the same virus look different and act in different ways. Scientists can learn a lot about a virus by studying its genome."
