        "October 8, 2001 -- Are you depressed? Anxious? Still suffering from a long-ago trauma? Psychotherapy and psychiatric drugs can help restore balance to your mind and body. But increasingly, there are more options. For instance, researchers now say hormone treatments offer a more natural approach to mental health.",
        "So what are hormones? They're substances produced in our bodies to regulate our biological activities. Growth hormones control our development, stress hormones are released when our bodies detect a threat, and sex hormones control the maturation and function of our sex organs. And these are just the tip of the iceberg.",

        "At a recent ISPNE conference, Halbreich spoke about how endocrinologists study hormones and how psychiatrists and neurologists study the brain . What falls through the cracks of this research is the important role that hormones play in our mental health. One of the roles of a psychoneuroendocrinologist is to help fill in those cracks.",
        "In an interview with WebMD, Halbreich looks at some of the many ways hormones affect our brains, emotions, and well-being."

As a result, drugs that help the body produce ANP or some similar hormone could be an excellent treatment for panic disorder and possibly other anxiety-related problems."
