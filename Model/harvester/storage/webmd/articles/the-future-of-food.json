        "June 2, 2022 – Sixty years ago, The Jetsons imagined that in the future, we’d be eating meals in pill form . That hasn’t come to pass – yet . So what (and how) do experts think we’ll be eating 30, 40, 50 years from now? The last 6 decades have seen huge leaps in agricultural and food processing innovation. Since 1960, the world’s population has more than doubled – yet global food production has more than tripled, while using only 15% more land. That may sound great, but it’s come at a price to both our health and the planet. More than 300 million adults around the world have obesity, which has major effects on human health. The cancer death rate has risen 17% since 1990. And the way we grow, process, and transport food contributes significantly to climate change that may soon overwhelm the planet. “We’ve gotten exactly what we designed our food system for. We’ve optimized for low-cost, mass-produced calories,” says Scott Bowman, co-founder of The Nourish Movement . “Now we need to optimize for human health and planetary health.”"

        "In order to do both, experts say three things will be key: sustainability, food technology, and food as medicine. This special report looks at how each of them can help us get there. In 2020, as many as 811 million people worldwide didn’t have enough to eat, and Earth’s population is projected to grow by another 2 billion in the next 30 years. Experts project we’ll need to produce as much as 56% more food to feed everyone, but we can’t do that sustainably without some major changes. We are making progress, though. If everyone does their part – scientists and farmers, manufacturers and retailers, governments and nonprofits, and of course, consumers – we can save the planet and have enough nutritious food to go around. “Farmers are wildly more sustainable now than they were in 1980,” says Jack Bobo, JD, director of global food and water policy at the Nature Conservancy. “It’s not as if things are bad and getting worse – they’re good and getting better, just not fast enough. Historical trends won’t get us where we need to go by 2050. We need to do things differently.”"
