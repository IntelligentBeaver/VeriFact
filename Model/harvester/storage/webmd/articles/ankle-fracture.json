        "A broken ankle, or ankle fracture, happens when one or more of the bones in your ankle joint break. It can be caused by things such as twisting your ankle, falling, or being in a car accident. The symptoms often include pain, swelling, bruising, and trouble walking. Some breaks are minor and can heal with a boot or cast, while others are more serious and may need surgery. Treatment depends on how bad the break is and may include pain relievers, rest, and physical therapy. With proper care, most ankle fractures heal well. But more serious breaks may take you months to get well and can lead to long-term stiffness or arthritis."
