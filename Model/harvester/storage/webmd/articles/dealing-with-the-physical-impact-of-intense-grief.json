        "“I thought the grief would literally kill me,” she said. “People often don’t talk about how physical grief is, but it’s a shock to your entire being. When this grief came flooding in, I didn’t know what to do with it.”",
        "Whitmore, who went on to become a grief counselor herself, remembers thinking, “I don’t know how anyone can survive this.” Then she began to contemplate her situation. “Maybe I will survive, but this type of grief has to be doing something to my body — to my bones, creating gut-wrenching, unrelenting pain that goes on day after day, week after week, month after month.”",
        "The grief indeed took a physical toll. Whitmore began having chest pain that turned out to be a symptom of anxiety attacks. “But I had other physical experiences as well,” she said. She eventually developed an autoimmune disease and, now in her 70s, has high blood pressure, too."
