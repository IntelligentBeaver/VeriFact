        "Copiktra (duvelisib) is a type of cancer treatment for certain people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) . CLL and SLL are slow-growing cancers that affect a type of white blood cell in your body called lymphocytes . Lymphocytes are cells that help your body fight infections. CLL and SLL cause your body to make too many lymphocytes that do not work as they should. These abnormal cells crowd out healthy cells over time and can lead to symptoms.",
        "Some people with CLL or SLL may not have any symptoms for many years. Others may have symptoms and may have the disease spread to their lymph nodes , liver, and spleen. Common symptoms include tiredness, infections, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, fever or chills, and swelling of lymph nodes in your neck, armpits, stomach, or groin.",
        "Treatment of CLL or SLL depends on how advanced it is. In the early stages if you have no symptoms, you may not need any treatment besides having regular health care provider visits to make sure your condition has not changed. If CLL or SLL have advanced, treatment may include chemotherapy , immunotherapy , targeted therapy , radiation , surgery, or other types of treatment."
