        "Where someone lives also can affect their ability to get food. For example, some urban areas, rural places, and low-income neighborhoods only have convenience stores and small independent stores instead of full-service supermarkets or grocery stores. That typically means higher prices, fewer choices, and less healthy food. And when public transportation is limited, it can be even harder to get enough healthy meals on the table.",
        "While food insecurity may sound a lot like hunger, the two are different. Hunger is a physical issue that can be caused by food insecurity. It can lead to illness, weakness, or pain."
