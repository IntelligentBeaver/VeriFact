        "Dental plaque is a sticky film of bacteria that builds up on your teeth throughout your day. It's colorless so you may not see it, but it's still there. The bacteria in plaque make acids that can damage the enamel on your teeth and cause cavities. If you don't remove it regularly, it can also cause red, swollen, bleeding gums (also called gingivitis ). If you leave it too long, plaque can harden on your teeth and below your gumline. Hardened plaque is called tartar, and it can cause gum (periodontal) disease. Periodontal disease can cause chewing problems, loose teeth, and, in some cases, tooth loss.",
        "Several studies show that people with periodontal disease and tooth loss have a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease or dementia as they grow older. Scientists don't know if poor oral health causes dementia, but taking good care of your teeth and gums is an easy way to ensure you stay healthy throughout your life.",
