These VOCs are gases that are emitted into the air that may cause you harm in their original form or by reacting with other gases after they are released in the air.",
        "It is also advisable to avoid smoking and vaping in the car. With constant exposure to smoke from cigarettes (including e-cigarettes) you may come in contact with toxic carcinogenic chemicals such as benzene and formaldehyde. This is even more dangerous when you are traveling for a prolonged period in the enclosed space of your car as this increases your exposure to these harmful chemicals. Another point to keep in mind is that traveling with several passengers for a long time leads to increased exposure to the carbon dioxide that is exhaled by everyone, and this exposure can make you drowsy.",
