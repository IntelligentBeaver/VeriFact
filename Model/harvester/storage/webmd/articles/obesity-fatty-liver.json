        "Obesity is linked to a lot of issues that can impact your health and quality of life. One of these is a condition called fatty liver disease. Fatty liver disease is an illness in which fat builds up in the liver. It happens because your liver can’t process and rid itself of fat efficiently. There are two basic types of fatty liver disease: Alcoholic fatty liver disease happens when heavy drinking damages your liver and makes it less able to break down fat. The other more common type isn’t related to alcohol use. It was long called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), because it’s found in people who drink little if any alcohol at all. Doctors and researchers now refer to it as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). A number of things can increase your chances of getting MASLD. But having obesity may be the most common risk factor of all. In fact, up to two-thirds of people with MASLD have obesity. Fat buildup can eventually damage your liver, prevent it from functioning properly, and may result in liver failure. Research also suggests there’s a strong link between MASLD and diseases of your heart and blood vessels. The encouraging news is that MASLD is treatable and can even be reversed. The key is catching the disease early and taking action."

        "A top cause of obesity is consuming more calories than your body needs for energy. You store the extra calories as fat throughout your body, including in your liver. As the rate of obesity has climbed in society, so have rates of MASLD. Currently, about one-third of adults globally have MASLD. Fatty liver in children – which used to be rare – has more than doubled since the late 1980s. MASLD can range in severity. Doctors diagnose “simple fatty liver” (hepatic steatosis) when fat accounts for at least 5% of your liver’s overall weight. It usually doesn’t worsen or have symptoms and doesn’t affect your liver function. Most people with MASLD have simple fatty liver. But about 20% of the time, MASLD becomes a more serious condition called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH (formerly known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH). This is when excess fat causes the liver to become inflamed. Chronic inflammation can scar the liver and lead to cirrhosis and eventually liver failure. MASH is actually the fastest-growing reason why people in the United States require liver transplants."

Exercise doesn’t have to be exhausting to be effective. Start slowly and just get your body moving with, for example, brief, regular walks. Ultimately, you’ll want to be able to do some moderate-intensity activities that’ll make you sweat and will raise your heart rate. For instance, try jogging, resistance training, Zumba, or playing pickleball. Even without weight loss, exercise can directly benefit your liver and metabolic health. Case in point: Resistance training with dumbbells, barbells, or your own body weight directs excess glucose to your muscles and takes some of the burden off your liver. At least 135 minutes per week of aerobic exercise, research suggests, can modestly reduce the amount of fat in your liver, even if you don't lose weight."
