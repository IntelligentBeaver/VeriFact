Follicular lymphoma is a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that affects white blood cells called lymphocytes . Follicular lymphoma mostly affects a specific type of lymphocyte called a B cell. B cells normally help protect your body by fighting off germs. But people with follicular lymphoma have B cells that become cancerous.",

        "Monjuvi is a type of medicine known as a monoclonal antibody . Antibodies are proteins your immune system makes to help fight infection. The antibodies stick to proteins called antigens on the surfaces of cells. Different kinds of cells have different antigens. Only one kind of antibody fits each antigen, like a key in a lock. The antibodies mark the \"bad\" cells so your immune system can go after and destroy them. Monoclonal antibodies are made in a lab. They are designed to lock onto certain antigens that cancer cells make too much of."
