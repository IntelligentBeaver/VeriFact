        "Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is a viral infection that typically affects children ages 10 and younger (although teenagers and adults can also contract the illness). It spreads person-to-person through air droplets released when someone coughs, sneezes, or blows their nose. You can also catch it by touching a surface with virus contamination, or by contacting blister fluids or stool (poop) from someone with the disease.",
        "The most common cause of hand-foot-and-mouth disease is a virus named coxsackievirus A16. Most cases occur in the summer and early fall.",
        "Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is not the same as foot-and-mouth disease or hoof-and-mouth disease. That viral infection occurs only in farm animals and can’t be transmitted to humans. Humans can’t pass hand-foot-and-mouth disease on to pets or other animals.",
        "Hand-foot-and-mouth disease often spreads in childcare settings because of frequent toilet use and diaper changes. Smaller children are more likely to put their hands in their mouths, then place them on other people or surfaces.",
        "The most contagious phase for children is during the first week. But the virus often sticks around in your child’s system for weeks after they’ve stopped showing symptoms. Adults may show no symptoms at all yet still be infectious."
