        "April 10, 2024 – More than 60,000 utility groups that supply much of the U.S. with its drinking water must ensure it’s free of six synthetic chemicals that the Environmental Protection Agency now says may lead to serious illnesses, such as cancer.",
        "Often referred to as “forever chemicals,” there are thousands of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that come from everyday items like nonstick cookware, food packaging, waterproof clothing, stain-resistant furniture, and firefighting foam. The chemicals typically help with product features like waterproofing, and don’t break down in the environment, meaning they can linger in groundwater for generations.",
        "Studies have found PFAS can build up in the body over time, and are even in umbilical cord blood passed from a mother to a fetus in the womb. The substances have been linked to cancer, reproductive problems, poor immune system function, developmental problems in children, heart and liver damage, and other health issues.",
        "“EPA expects that over many years, the final rule will prevent PFAS exposure in drinking water for approximately 100 million people, prevent thousands of deaths, and reduce tens of thousands of serious PFAS-attributable illnesses,” the agency explained in its announcement of the new regulations, which were posted online Wednesday."
