        "If your child daydreams a lot at school, is easily distracted while doing homework or chores, or fidgets constantly, you might wonder if they have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Or is it attention deficit disorder (ADD)? Or perhaps you're wondering if you could have ADD or ADHD yourself, ever since you were a younger person, and never got diagnosed.",

        "Not exactly. These are really two names for the same condition, but ADD isn't used by doctors anymore. You might still hear people use the name ADD, but it isn't an official diagnosis. A person with ADD today would be diagnosed with one of the three subtypes of ADHD instead.",

In the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) , published in 1980, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) gave this mental health condition the name attention deficit disorder (ADD). ADD had two types — it could be either with or without hyperactivity."
