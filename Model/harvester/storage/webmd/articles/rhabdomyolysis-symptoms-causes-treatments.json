However, it can be difficult to tell the difference between rhabdomyolysis and typical post-workout fatigue. Be alert to symptoms in a particular muscle or muscle group. If you notice extreme pain, weakness, swelling, or cramping in your muscles, and/or very dark urine, go to the hospital immediately.",

It can result from exercise, a crush injury, or alcohol or illegal drug use, among other traumatic and nontraumatic causes. Signs of rhabdo often include very dark brown or red urine and severe muscular pain or weakness, but half of people may not experience muscle-related symptoms. You should go to the hospital immediately if you experience these symptoms to confirm it's rhabdomyolysis and receive treatment."
