        "Your adrenal glands sit on top of your kidneys. With classic CAH, these glands don’t make enough of key hormones that help your body function, including one or more of the following: Cortisol . Regulates blood pressure, blood sugar, and other functions that use energy when you’re stressed, sick, or hurt Aldosterone. Helps balance your sodium and fluid levels, along with blood pressure A lack of cortisol triggers the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Your body then shifts the ACTH stimulation of the adrenals into an androgen hormone-producing pathway. Both male and female children need these hormones to grow and develop. But kids with classic CAH have very higher levels of androgens – often labeled as male or “masculinizing” sex hormones – than what’s considered normal."

You pee out too much sodium and water because you don’t make enough aldosterone. Simple-virilizing CAH. Around 1 in 4 babies are simple virilizers. This means you make excess androgens due to low cortisol, but your aldosterone production is usually fine. For that reason, simple-virilizing CAH is less serious than salt-wasting CAH. Classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia and nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia are the two most common kinds of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, making up 95% of all cases. Classic CAH is serious and sometimes fatal. Nonclassic CAH is a milder form, and you may not know you have it until you’re an older child, teenager, or adult."

But they may have external changes at birth and later in life, including: Enlarged clitoris or fused labia that look more like a penis Typical male traits like larger muscles, a deeper voice, and excess facial hair Irregular or absent menstrual periods Trouble getting pregnant Genetic males at birth may not always have clear signs of classic CAH, but some symptoms may include the following: Enlarged penis or darker scrotum Noncancerous tumors on the testicles Facial hair at an early age In some cases, a baby assigned male at birth might actually be a genetic female with a severe degree of external masculinization. Both male and female children with excess androgens may show early signs of puberty. If they don't get treatment early on, they may: Grow fast Be shorter than normal when they stop growing Get bad acne or pubic/armpit hair at a young age",
