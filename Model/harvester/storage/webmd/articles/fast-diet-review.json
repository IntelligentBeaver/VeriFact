The diet also isn't recommended for kids, teens, frail seniors, or anyone who isn't feeling well or has a fever.",

        "Mosley tried this \" intermittent fasting \" diet when his doctor showed him that though he was only a few pounds overweight, his cholesterol was high and his blood sugar was headed in the wrong direction. He writes that he knew fasting would be difficult, but his hunger pangs passed quicker than he expected. He also felt that fasting sharpened his senses and his brain. Plus, the diet delivered all the results he hoped for.",
        "On its website, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics says that although there is evidence that intermittent fasting diets may help prevent chronic disease, more research is needed. It doesn't recommend the diet because \"it is not a realistic long-term solution.” The academy also notes that \"any variation of fasting may make a person irritable, cause daytime sleepiness/sleeplessness at night, and can even lead to dehydration .\""

        "Even though many health experts don’t recommend fasting , if you’re going to do it, the authors of this plan have it right. Eating 500-600 calories a couple of days a week will be tough, but it’s doable.",
        "One reason experts tell people not to cut way back on calories is that it can slow your metabolism, making it even harder to lose weight. But studies show that fasting from time to time can be an effective strategy for weight loss. In addition, cutting calories on a couple of days instead of every day may help preserve muscle, so you lose mostly fat.",
        "Mosley’s team found that people don’t overindulge on the non-fasting days. Other research suggests they may be right. But it’s ultimately up to you to make sure you don’t sabotage your weight loss efforts on the “off” days.",

        "If you have diabetes , this is absolutely not the weight loss plan for you. It could be dangerous, especially if you take medicine, and lower your blood sugar into unsafe -- even deadly -- territory.",
        "For others, there are some early studies that show it may help improve some risk factors for heart disease , including blood pressure and cholesterol. Though any weight loss plan that drops the pounds is likely to also have this effect.",

        "If fasting interests you, The Fast Diet is a decent approach. It’s going to take some serious willpower, but if you’re up for the challenge, it can work. It’s definitely not meant for everyone, so don’t ignore the warnings.",
