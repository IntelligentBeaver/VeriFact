        "Depression, or major depressive disorder (MDD), is a mental health condition that affects how you think, feel, and handle daily life. It’s more than just feeling sad sometimes. Depression is a serious condition that often needs treatment to get better. Standard antidepressants work well for most people. But 1 in 3 continue to have symptoms. That’s called treatment-resistant depression (TRD). When you have TRD, your depression symptoms stick around even after you’ve tried at least two standard antidepressants at a sufficient dose for sufficient time; typically, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). To give a medication a fair shot, you’ll need to take it exactly as prescribed for at least four to six weeks. Your doctor may call this an adequate trial. If you’ve done that and still don’t feel better, it may be time to consider other treatment options. Symptoms of TRD are the same as major depressive disorder and can include: Low energy or mood Hopelessness about the future Loss of interest in activities you usually enjoy (anhedonia) Trouble concentrating Feeling guilty or worthless"

        "In 2024, the FDA approved the first smartphone app to help with treatment of major depressive disorder. It’s called Rejoyn. The app offers a six-week program that includes cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other emotional exercises. It’s designed as an add-on treatment to medication. Psychedelics, like psilocybin (magic mushrooms) and MDMA (ecstasy), are not yet approved by the FDA to treat depression. But they’re being studied in clinical trials. Early research shows they boost brain connections and may help ease symptoms, especially for treatment-resistant depression."
