That way, you and your employer can prepare for when you’ll need to miss work. You may worry about bringing up your illness on the job. But there are laws that protect you from work problems related to your cancer. This is something your HR department should know about. Ask it to go over the kind of help you can get. When it comes to prostate cancer and your job, here are some things to ask: What kind of changes can you make to help me keep working? How can I keep my job if I need time off because I’m sick? Can I still get short- or long-term disability insurance? How much notice do I need to give for family and medical leave (FMLA)? What else can I do to protect my job?",

        "Prostate cancer treatment costs can add up. For example, you may need to pay a copay every time you go to a doctor visit. Lab tests or scans may cost extra. You may need radiation therapy several times a week or a one-time surgery. Keep in mind it’s not a good idea to skip recommended treatments based solely on the price tag. But it’s OK to ask your doctor if there’s a way to lower your costs. They can help you weigh the pros and cons of all your choices. Here are some questions to get you started: This hormonal treatment costs me a lot. Why do I need it? Is there an older or cheaper treatment I can try first? Is active surveillance (watchful waiting) an option for me? Do I really need surgery or radiation therapy right now? You may also want to ask: Can I opt for telehealth instead of in-person doctor visits? Can you waive the cost of some of my copays? Can we combine visits, so I have fewer copays?"
