        "Aquaphor products are used to treat dry, chapped, or irritated skin and lips. Aquaphor products are also used to prevent wind and cold weather from drying out your skin and lips. They can also be used to treat minor burns, cuts, and scrapes. The main active ingredient in most Aquaphor products is petrolatum, which is a skin protectant. Petrolatum works to trap moisture on your skin by forming a barrier on your skin. This helps prevent water from evaporating off your skin, which can make your skin dry.",
        "There are some Aquaphor products that are used to help treat diaper rash. Most of these products contain a skin protectant called zinc oxide. Zinc oxide works to form a barrier on the skin to help protect against irritants and wetness. There is one Aquaphor product used to help with itchiness that contains a corticosteroid called hydrocortisone. Hydrocortisone works to reduce inflammation on your skin, which can help lessen your itching.",
