        "Multiple sclerosis (MS) can be an expensive disease, and prescription drugs -- specifically, disease-modifying therapies -- are the largest piece of the cost puzzle. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, as of February 2022, the median annual price of a brand-name disease-modifying therapy was close to $94,000.",
        "While insurance covers part of the costs for MS, out-of-pockets costs are still daunting and rising. In one study, researchers tracked spending on out-of-pocket costs paid by people with MS who had Medicare Part D. In the last 10 years alone, the price for these treatments has increased nearly $34,000.",
        "Out-of-pocket costs for MS will depend largely on the treatments you get and your insurance coverage. Your policy may have a deductible before insurance coverage kicks in. After that, you may owe coinsurance, or a percentage of the total cost, up to an out-of-pocket max. Insurance may also cover some assistive devices, but you may need a prescription for those from your medical provider.",
        "Beyond drug costs, people with MS tend to spend more on health costs in general than others, often due to other conditions that they have as well as MS. Each person with MS is unique, and the disease isn’t the same for everyone. In general, the more the disease has progressed, the greater a person’s costs will be."
