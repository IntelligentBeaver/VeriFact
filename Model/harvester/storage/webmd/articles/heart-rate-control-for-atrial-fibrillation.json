        "Rate control is not a cure for AFib , but a way of keeping your heart rate in check. It’s done with medications that keep your heart from beating too quickly. You take most of them on a regular basis. You use others when you’re having sudden problems.",
        "The aim of these treatments is to slow down the rate of your heartbeat. This can reduce AFib symptoms and lead to a better quality of life. They also can improve hemodynamics, which is how well your heart and blood vessels move blood through your body.",
        "How low your heart rate should go depends on how serious your condition is. If you’re having symptoms of AFib, your doctor will probably try to get your resting heart rate below 80 beats per minute. If you don’t have symptoms and your left ventricle (your heart’s main blood-pumping chamber) is working well, the goal may be a bit higher.",
