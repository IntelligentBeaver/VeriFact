CGRP antagonists are a new class of drugs that block the effects of CGRP. It is an option if you have a poor response with triptans or you cannot take triptans because of a history of heart disease or stroke. Oral forms of CGRP antagonists approved for acute migraine include atogepant ( Qulipta ), rimegepant (Nurtec ODT), and ubrogepant ( Ubrelvy ). Zavegepant (Zavzpret) is a recently approved CGRP antagonist in the form of a nasal spray.",
