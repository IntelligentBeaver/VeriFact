That means it changes the way the immune system behaves. Lenalidomide blocks a protein on lymphoma cells called cereblon and also interferes with the environment around the tumor that might help the cancer cells survive. In a study that compared rituximab alone to rituximab plus lenalidomide, the combo almost tripled the length of time before the lymphoma progressed. People on the combo treatment had no disease progression for an average of 39 months compared to 14 months on rituximab alone. You typically take a lenalidomide pill every day for 3 weeks out of every month for up to 12 months.",

        "Cancer cells become resistant to treatment by changing or “mutating.” Targeted treatments are for people whose follicular lymphoma has relapsed a second time after developing a specific treatment-resisting gene change called an EZH2 mutation. About 1 in 4 people with follicular lymphoma have this gene change. Targeted treatments include the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat ( Tazverik) and the BTK inhibitor zanubrutinib (Brukinsa) in combination with obinutuzumab. This treatment approach combines radiation with anti-CD20 antibodies. The IV medication is radioactive. When the lab-made antibodies find and latch onto specific proteins on the cancer cells, they deliver radiation to the cells at the same time. More than 85% of people who get this treatment plus rituximab respond to it. The response rate is slightly lower in people whose cancer has become resistant to rituximab. CAR T-cell therapy. This type of treatment has been a breakthrough in aggressive blood cancers such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma. In this therapy, doctors remove immune cells called T cells from your body. They then use medication to reengineer the cells to recognize and fight cancer cells. Then they put the souped-up cells back in your body. It’s FDA approved for relapsed or treatment-resistant follicular lymphoma, but it hasn’t been in use for as long as other treatments. So far, researchers have found that 85% to 95% of patients respond to this type of treatment depending on the specific medication used. In a study of axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta), one specific type of CAR T-cell therapy, the treatment delayed disease progression by about 40 months. Axicabtagene ciloleucel, tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah), and lisocabtagene maraleucel (Breyanzi) are the CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapies that are FDA-approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma."

        "Besides the many drugs for follicular lymphoma currently on the market, researchers continue to study numerous others. Here’s a look at treatment options that may be on the horizon. New antibodies. Rituximab targets one protein, CD20, on the surface of follicular lymphoma cells. Scientists continue to research other lab-made antibodies that would target other proteins on lymphoma cells. Some of this research explores what’s called bispecific antibodies – drugs that contain two different antibodies aimed at two different proteins. Antibody-drug conjugates. These medications contain both a lab-made antibody and an anti-cancer drug. Lab-made antibodies can recognize and latch onto specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells in order to shut down their activity. With antibody-drug conjugates, when the medicine enters your system and latches onto the specific protein on the surface of the cancer cell, it delivers an anti-cancer drug to the cell at the same time. Researchers are exploring a few of these types of drugs for the treatment of follicular lymphoma. In clinical trials, they are giving these drugs in combination with other drugs already in wide use for follicular lymphoma, such as rituximab and lenalidomide."
