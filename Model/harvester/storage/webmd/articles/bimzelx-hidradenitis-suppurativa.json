        "Bimzelx (bimekizumab-bkzx) is a biologic medicine approved by the FDA in 2023. Bimzelx is approved to treat a variety of skin and joint conditions affected by the immune system, including a skin condition called hidradenitis suppurativa . Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory condition that causes painful bumps under your skin in the hair roots and near sweat glands. It’s also known as acne inversa. The bumps can get infected. When that happens, pockets form under your skin and fill with pus. They can smell bad when they break open. They can also leave scars. There's no cure for hidradenitis suppurativa, but treatments and lifestyle changes can bring some relief and cut down on flare-ups."

        "Bimzelx is a type of medicine called a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are human-made antibodies created in the lab to mimic antibodies in the body. Bimzelx works by blocking two naturally occurring proteins called cytokines in the immune system (interleukin [IL]-17A and IL-17F) from interacting with a receptor complex that can cause inflammation in the skin and joints. By stopping these proteins, Bimzelx helps reduce redness, swelling, and scaling of the skin."
