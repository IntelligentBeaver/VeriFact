These cells crowd out healthy mature red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The goal of AML treatments is to destroy unhealthy immature blood cells in your bone marrow and blood. The goal is to put you into a complete remission, which means you have no blood markers or symptoms of cancer.",
