Also, the study showed that 10 minutes was even better, since the bodies of the people in the study became more sensitive to insulin, the hormone that stores blood sugar in cells.

However, eating a balanced diet is part of an overall plan that can keep your blood sugar from spiking.

If you use steroid injections to treat a medical condition, one possible side effect is a spike in blood sugar that can last for up to several days. Studies show that if you have diabetes and it’s well-managed, your blood sugar level will return to normal after a steroid shot sooner than if you’re currently struggling to keep the condition under control. Talk to your doctor about ways to bring down your numbers after a steroid shot."
