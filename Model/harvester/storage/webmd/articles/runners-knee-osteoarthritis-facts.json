Your doctor might suggest physical therapy to strengthen the muscles in your leg and make you more flexible. Putting heat or ice on your knee or wearing bandages to support it may also help. You can take over-the-counter pain relievers, or your doctor might prescribe stronger medications such as steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories ( NSAIDs ), to ease inflammation and pain.",
