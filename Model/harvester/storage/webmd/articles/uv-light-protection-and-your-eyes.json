        "No matter what season it is, whether you’re on vacation or taking a walk around your neighborhood, we all love to soak up the sun. The sun is 93 million miles away, however light from the sun takes about 8 minutes to reach Earth. The light rays from the sun that reach Earth are known as solar radiation, which is composed of visible light, ultraviolet light, infrared light, radio waves, X-rays, and gamma rays. With significant exposure, almost all of the electromagnetic spectrum may cause damage to your eyes. However, it’s widely reported that ultraviolet (UV) radiation is known to cause damage to the eyes.",
