        "What Is Jascayd, and Why Does It Matter?",
        "Jascayd (nerandomilast) is a new oral medicine approved to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in adults. IPF is a rare and serious condition that causes scarring (fibrosis) in the lungs that worsens over time, making it harder to breathe and do daily tasks. Jascayd works by blocking an enzyme called PDE4 (phosphodiesterase 4), which plays a crucial role in inflammation and tissue damage. By targeting this enzyme, the medicine may help slow down lung scarring and reduce inflammation.",
        "Affecting mostly adults ages 60-70 years, Jascayd is the first new treatment for IPF in more than a decade. IPF causes symptoms like shortness of breath and a dry cough that gradually worsen, with sudden flare-ups, during which symptoms become more severe. While there is no cure for IPF, Jascayd may help slow down the disease progress.",
        "Why Was It Approved?",
        "Jascayd was approved based on two clinical trials that showed it helped slow down worsening of lung function in people with IPF.",
        "People who took Jascayd had a smaller decline in how much air they could breathe out, compared with those who took a placebo. The higher dose of 18 mg twice daily showed more benefit than the lower dose (9 mg twice daily).",
        "The most common side effects included diarrhea, upper respiratory infections, depression, weight loss, decreased appetite, tiredness, headaches, back pain, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.",
        "Less common side effects included weakness, high levels of certain digestive enzymes (amylase), and inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis).",
        "What Do I Need to Know?",
        "You take Jascayd doses by mouth twice a day, about 12 hours apart, with or without food. The usual dose is 18 mg twice daily. If you have trouble with side effects, your health care provider may lower the dose to 9 mg twice daily. But if you're also taking another IPF medicine (pirfenidone), the dose should stay at 18 mg twice daily. If you miss a dose of Jascayd, take your next dose at your scheduled time. Do not take the missed dose.",
        "If swallowing pills is hard for you, the tablet can be mixed with water by following specific instructions.",
        "Before starting Jascayd, tell your health care provider about any health conditions you have, including serious kidney or liver problems, and all the medicines you take, including over-the-counter products, herbal remedies, and vitamin supplements. It can interact with other medicines, especially those that affect liver enzymes.",
        "Also tell your health care provider if you are pregnant or planning pregnancy. The medicine may raise the risk of pregnancy loss or miscarriage, and it is not known if Jascayd can harm an unborn baby. Talk with your health care provider if you are breastfeeding or planning to do so, as it is not known if Jascayd passes into breast milk or if it can affect your baby."
