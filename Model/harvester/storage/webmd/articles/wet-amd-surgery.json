        "This is a type of “hot” laser treatment, so-called because the laser generates heat during the procedure. During the surgery, the doctor uses an intense laser beam to burn and seal abnormal blood vessels in your eye. The goal of laser photocoagulation for wet AMD is to stop blood and fluid from continuously leaking into your retina. Laser photocoagulation is an older way to treat wet AMD. Newer drug treatments come with fewer side effects and work well for most people. That's why laser photocoagulation isn’t used very often anymore. But your doctor might suggest this type of surgery in certain situations. Laser photocoagulation might be an option for you if: Your abnormal blood vessels are in tight, well-defined clusters. The blood vessels are far away from the center of your macula. Your vision loss came on fast. You don’t respond to other treatments."
