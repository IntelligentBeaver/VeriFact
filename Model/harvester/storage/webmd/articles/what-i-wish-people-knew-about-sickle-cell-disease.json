        "Sickle cell disease affects 15,000 people in the U.K. and is one of the fastest-growing genetic conditions in the world. Sickle cell is a common condition in my community as it predominately affects Black people. However, it's often considered a rare disease by the general population. As a result, when speaking about sickle cell to general audiences, I have to explain what it is and how it affects me personally. I wish people knew what sickle cell was instantly like other conditions, but that isn't the reality, which can lead to mistreatment or misdiagnosis of symptoms.",
        "Sickle cell affects everyone differently. In the past, I've often been approached expecting to look or act a certain way because of preconceptions about sickle cell. I should have yellow eyes because of jaundice or inability to do specific tasks because of pain. Each person with sickle cell has different symptoms, and it's important to note when thinking about interacting with them.",

        "As I have the SS genotype of sickle cell disease, it means that one of my main symptoms is vaso-occlusive crises. The pain of a crisis is excruciating and very debilitating. In an instant, I can go from being able to walk to bedbound. The best description I've heard is to think of your hand being repeatedly slammed by a car door. Think of that pain happening every second of a crisis. The length of a crisis varies. It can be hours, days, weeks, or months. The recovery from a crisis usually takes weeks. First, it's recovery from the pain, then it's a mental and physical recovery to get back to how you were before a crisis.",
        "I've had many of these crises in my knees, which has led to an additional diagnosis of avascular necrosis in both knees. This has negatively impacted my mobility over time with chronic knee pain. My other symptom of sickle cell is fatigue, which sometimes makes everyday tasks difficult."

For example, mental check-ins of my well-being or how tired I am before doing anything that could stress me mentally or physically. However, when significant events occur or there's a break from my daily routine, I sometimes become overwhelmed or stressed, which throws me off. Stress can also contribute to a crisis. I'm accustomed to pushing past my tiredness to keep up with everyday life. Rarely do I use the excuse that I am tired; however, when I do, I wish people took me seriously, as being exhausted can lead to crises."
