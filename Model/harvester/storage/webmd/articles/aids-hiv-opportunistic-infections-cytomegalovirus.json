        "If you have a healthy immune system that can easily control the virus, it usually doesn't cause problems. But it can sicken people with weakened immune systems.",
        "In people who have advanced HIV, CMV can cause an eye infection called retinitis, which may lead to blindness. CMV retinitis is what’s known as an AIDS-defining condition. The virus could also affect your intestines, esophagus, lungs, brain, or nerves.",
