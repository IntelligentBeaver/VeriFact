For instance, people who dread flying may also be uncomfortable sitting in a narrow tube, confined to their seat and surrounded by strangers, and they may worry about turbulence and storms."

        "Even people who don't suffer from phobias tend to misjudge risks. We're wary of the scanning machines at the airport, but 1 million people visit tanning salons each day, soaking up ultraviolet radiation that raises the risk of skin cancer. Women worry most about breast cancer even though they're more likely to develop heart disease: About 40,000 women in the U.S. die each year from breast cancer, while more than 300,000 die from heart attacks . We fear things we can't control -- and cancer seems more out of our control.",

In the past two years, there has not been a single death on a commercial U.S. airliner, while every day about 90 people die in motor vehicle accidents.",
        "But facts alone aren't enough. You have to outsmart your anxiety by focusing on the present rather than \"what if,\" Seif says. Many people just avoid whatever makes them uncomfortable. But Seif, who once had a fear of heights and of flying, says that doesn't work. \"If you avoid the anxiety sensations, you're just reinforcing the anxiety,\" he says."
