Progestin also makes it hard for an egg to grow in the uterine lining if it gets fertilized.",

If you use NuvaRing or EluRyng, you’ll put a new ring in at the end of week 4. If you use Annovera, you’ll use the same ring for a year. Remove, wash, and store it in its case during your period.",
        "Continuous use. Leave the ring in for 4 weeks, then replace it right away with a new one without leaving a week for your period. This is what’s called an off-label use. Your doctor might suggest doing this if you want fewer days of bleeding and constant birth control protection. But you may have some breakthrough bleeding with continuous use."
