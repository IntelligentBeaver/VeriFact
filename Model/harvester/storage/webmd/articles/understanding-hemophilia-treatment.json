        "Normally, when bleeding begins, a complex series of chemical events produces a \"plug\" to stop the bleeding; this plug is called a fibrin clot. The fibrin clot is the end-product of many different \"clotting factors\" reacting in the blood . Hemophilia is an inherited condition in which one of these clotting factors (mainly factor VIII or IX) is absent from the blood, so that it does not clot normally. If your health care provider suspects that you have hemophilia, you may be given blood tests to examine how well your blood creates this clot. A lab mixes your blood with specific chemicals in a test tube, to produce a fibrin clot. If such tests are abnormal, other blood tests are done to determine the amounts of factors VIII and IX in the blood. These tests help doctors diagnose the type of hemophilia and its severity."

Now, potential blood donors are carefully screened and all donated blood is tested for viruses. Donated blood is also processed to inactivate any unrecognized viruses. The chance of contracting any disease through treatment is now extremely low. Still, if you have hemophilia it is important for you to receive immunizations for hepatitis A and B to help prevent becoming infected with these viruses.",
