        "Does It Work?",
        "The heart of the O2 Diet is the ORAC scale, which was developed years ago by the USDA to show how rich a food is in antioxidants.",
        "In 2012, the USDA removed this table from their website due to concerns that it had been misunderstood and misused. The USDA says that the ORAC rating is a scientific reference tool and that there is no proof that number has any relevance to human health.",
        "Claims that these foods will slow down aging or give you more energy are unproven. But since the diet is packed with healthy fruits and vegetables and restricts calories, it will probably help you lose weight.",
        "Is it Good for Certain Conditions?",
        "If you are overweight, any weight loss will help lower blood pressure and prevent heart disease . By avoiding the off-limits foods, which include fried foods, high-fat or processed meats, and trans fats , you will be helping to keep your cholesterol level in line.",
        "The exercise portion of the O2 Diet is in line with the recommendations that everyone should aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week.",
        "Exercise, along with the weight loss, is a proven strategy to help prevent diabetes. If you already have diabetes , you will need to change your treatment plan to accommodate the cut in calories and the boost in activity. Make sure you talk with your doctor first.",
        "The Final Word",
        "There’s no proof that the O2 Diet works any better or differently than any other very low-calorie diet for weight loss, or that any fresh fruit or vegetable is somehow better than any others.",
        "But the now-discredited ORAC list is ripe with some very healthy food choices, and the plan is easy to follow.",
        "You have to be willing to shop and cook to follow this diet.  Tips for eating out are included in the plan, though this may be tricky to do.",
        "Depending on your eating habits, you will likely have to be a bit more adventurous to follow the plan. And you will have to be highly motivated to stick with it, especially during the 4-day cleanse phase."
