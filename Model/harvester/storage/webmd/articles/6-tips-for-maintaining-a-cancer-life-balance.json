        "Heading into my final year of undergrad at the University of Michigan, a breast cancer diagnosis was the last thing I expected to face. Concerned for my health, my parents and doctors suggested that taking the year off from school and returning home to Georgia for treatment might be the best option. However, I was very determined to complete my degree as planned while receiving treatment at my university’s hospital. Despite knowing my senior year would be different from what I had imagined, I didn’t want to miss out on making those last college memories with my friends and finishing the race we had started together.",
        "Being a full-time student while going through treatment was undoubtedly the most exhausting thing I’ve ever done. It pushed me to new limits -- physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Nonetheless, it was important to me to maintain an active life outside of cancer. In addition to attending classes, I continued working, participating in clubs, mentoring others, traveling whenever possible, and spending time with family and friends. This “cancer-life balance” helped me stay grounded and positive throughout treatment, making it even more rewarding when I finally crossed the finish line.",
        "Juggling a breast cancer diagnosis with everyday life was a rollercoaster. But what really kept me going was making time for things I loved and that took my mind off my diagnosis. Finding the perfect balance will look different for everyone, but here are some things that helped me along the way:"

        "Know your body’s limits. I like to think that I gained a second \"cancer battery\" alongside my social battery. When my body said it needed rest, I learned to listen and take time to recharge.",
        "Learn how to say “no” and be OK with it. I used to feel the need to participate in everything and meet other people’s expectations. My diagnosis forced me to decline certain commitments and focus on my well-being without feeling guilty.",
        "Use a system to stay organized. Cancer care requires coordination from several different angles. I needed a system to manage all my doctor appointments, treatments, and tests and to prevent me from becoming too overwhelmed. Google Calendar became my best friend, helping me plan my days and stay on top of everything",
        "Ask for help when you need it. It took me some time, but I learned to ask for help when I needed it. The support I received from friends and family was invaluable. I realized that people genuinely wanted to be there for me, and it made my journey easier knowing I wasn't alone.",
        "Do things that bring you joy. No matter how tough the days got, I made sure to indulge in activities that made me feel alive. Whether it was going to a football game at the Big House, having movie nights with friends, or taking short trips, those moments kept me going.",
        "Put your health first. Above all else, I had to prioritize my health. Cancer was a tough opponent, and I had to stay committed to my treatment plan and take care of myself to come out stronger on the other side."
