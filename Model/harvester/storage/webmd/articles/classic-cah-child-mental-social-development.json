        "Most parents worry about their child’s mental and social development at some point or another. But if yours has classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), there may be specific challenges that concern you. The good news is you likely have little to fear. “If a child with classic CAH is treated early, and consistently, they usually end up doing well emotionally and socially,” says Heino Meyer-Bahlburg, PhD, a professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City. But living with a condition that needs lifelong medication could potentially affect their mental health over time. Here’s how to best support your child."

        "“Parents often feel reassured if their daughters have play dates with other girls who share their same interests,” says Meyer-Bahlburg. In girls with CAH and severely atypical genitalia , experts suggest a discussion about early reconstruction. In those with minimally atypical genitals, parents should be informed about surgical options, including delaying surgery and/or observation until the child is older. That said, your child may be self-conscious if her genitals look different from those of her friends, says Sandberg. It’s recommended that you make the decision about surgery with their entire medical team. That includes their endocrinologist , a pediatric surgeon , and mental health professionals. “Most patients with classic CAH say that they are happy that they had the surgery done in early childhood,” says Sandberg."

        "“Some boys with classic CAH may go through early puberty, which has some social advantages because they’re taller and stronger than their classmates,” says Ulrick Vieux, DO, director of child and adolescent psychiatry education at Hackensack University Medical Center in Hackensack, NJ. But higher levels of testosterone may also mean stronger emotions, including feeling more aggressive. Early puberty can also stunt growth, so they may end up shorter than their peers in the long term, Vieux says. As kids get older, parents need to prepare themselves for questions, like “Why do I need to take hormones every day?” “Initially, you’ll want to give them a simple explanation, like their body doesn’t make enough of a particular juice and this medicine helps to replace it,” says Meyer-Bahlburg. Later, you’ll be able to explain that this juice is an important hormone. And if they don’t get enough, it can impact their entire body. It’s also important to teach your child ways to help manage anxiety. For example, kids with classic CAH usually get their blood drawn several times a year. This can be stressful. Sandberg recommends asking their health care team about distraction techniques that can make the process easier, like deep breathing exercises."
