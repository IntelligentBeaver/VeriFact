        "May-Thurner syndrome, also known as iliac vein compression syndrome or Cockett's syndrome, affects two blood vessels that go to your legs. It could make you more likely to have a DVT ( deep vein thrombosis ) in your left leg.",
        "Your blood vessels carry blood to every part of your body. Your arteries move blood away from your heart, and your veins bring it back. Sometimes, arteries and veins cross over each other. Normally, that’s not a problem. But it is if you have May-Thurner syndrome.",
        "This condition involves your right iliac artery, which carries blood to your right leg, and the left iliac vein, which brings blood out of your left leg toward your heart .",
        "In May-Thurner syndrome, the right iliac artery squeezes the left iliac vein when they cross each other in your pelvis. Because of that pressure, blood can’t flow as freely through the left iliac vein. It’s a bit like stepping partway down on a hose.",
        "The result: You’re more likely to get a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in your left leg. A DVT is a type of blood clot that can be very serious. It’s not just that it can block blood flow in your leg. It can also break off and cause a clot in your lung . That’s called a pulmonary embolism , and it can be life-threatening."
