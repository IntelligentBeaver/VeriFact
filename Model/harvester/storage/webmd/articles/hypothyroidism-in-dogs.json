        "The thyroid gland is in the neck. It makes a hormone called thyroxine that controls metabolism (the process of turning food into fuel). With hypothyroidism , the gland doesn’t make enough of that hormone.",
        "It’s a common disease in dogs. It affects all breeds , but it is often found in golden retrievers, Labrador retrievers , Doberman pinschers, Irish setters, dachshunds, boxers, and cocker spaniels. It usually happens in middle-aged dogs (ages 4 to 10) of medium to large breeds . Neutered males and spayed females also have a higher risk, but vets are unsure why.",
        "It is thought that in some cases of hypothyroidism, your dog’s immune system attacks their thyroid. Other causes are the shrinking of their thyroid and, although rare, a tumor of the thyroid gland. No matter the cause, symptoms and treatments are the same."

This is followed by weight gain (despite decreased appetite), muscle loss, sluggishness, a slowed heart rate , toenail and ear infections, and intolerance to cold. It’s not widespread, but hypothyroidism is also linked to seizures , heart and blood vessel problems, and infertility.",
