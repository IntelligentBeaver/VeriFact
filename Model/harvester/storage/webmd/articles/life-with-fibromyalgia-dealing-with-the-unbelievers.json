In hindsight, maybe I should’ve stayed home. Maybe forcing myself to sing and dance while I was sick was a mistake. Perhaps that contributed to what happened next.",

Headaches distracted me during class and dizziness forced me to brace myself against the lockers while I walked between classes.",

The little electric shocks didn’t bother me, but the glue from the electrodes got stuck in my hair! That felt like the end of the world to teenage me!"
