        "Not in my wildest dreams did I imagine the diagnosis would be metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). I’ve always been active. I played sports, I didn’t drink, and I didn’t have diabetes, high cholesterol , or high blood pressure.",
        "I thought I was healthy, but my habits told a different story. I’m Venezuelan, and living in Miami meant being surrounded by strong, sugar-packed Cuban coffee and pastelitos — pastries loaded with even more sugar. My wife’s family is Cuban, and our meals included cooking with fat, eating donuts for breakfast , and serving rice, beans, chicharrones (crispy, fried pork skin), and processed foods ."
