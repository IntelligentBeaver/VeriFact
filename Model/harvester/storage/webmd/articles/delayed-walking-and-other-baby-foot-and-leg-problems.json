        "Most babies can pull themselves up to stand and begin taking their first steps somewhere between the ages of 8 months and 18 months. Soon after their first birthday, they can usually take a few steps alone, but prior to this will have started to 'cruise' -- walking along the edge of a couch or table, using furniture or outstretched hands for support. But what if your baby shows signs of delayed walking? And what if you notice your baby has bowed legs or is walking on tiptoes -- should you worry?",
        "There is a wide variation from one baby to the next in learning to walk . Timing of first steps can also vary between babies of different ethnic backgrounds. One baby may not walk until three or four months after another baby has walked. That doesn't necessarily signal a problem or delayed walking. Both children are likely to be equally healthy and able to run and play as they get older."

Signs include one leg looking shorter than the other, unequal creases in your baby's thighs or buttocks compared to the other side, and overly stiff hips. The doctor will examine the hips to feel whether the hip dislocates or pops back into the joint. Don’t worry -- the exam is done gently, and at worst may be a little uncomfortable. Hip dysplasia requires treatment, usually by a pediatric orthopedic specialist who will usually first assess the hips with X-rays and/or an ultrasound . Depending on the findings, treatment may range from continued observation to special hip braces/splints, manipulation of the hips under anesthesia , or surgery.

This condition causes a baby's hips to develop in the wrong location because of overly relaxed ligaments and joints. Hip dysplasia can lead to delayed walking or other walking problems. That's because a dislocated hip can cause pain that's made worse during weight-bearing. Developmental hip dysplasia is a general term for any number of problems with a baby's hips. This can be found in about five of every thousand newborns. Only about one in 1,000, though, actually has a hip dislocation.
