But also being away from your usual place of eating and going to the bathroom can disrupt the bowels.",
        "“Bowels don’t like surprises, and not only are you introducing new foods, but you might be eating at unusual times, staying out late, and eating later than usual.”",

        "Plan your flight or your driving route wisely. When booking your flight, choose a row close to the restroom -- and make sure you have an aisle seat so you don’t have to disturb a snoozing neighbor every time you get up to use it. Build in extra time to arrive at the airport early enough to use the bathroom before you board. If you’re driving a long distance, use the Internet to map out where all the rest areas are along your route.",
        "Don’t leave yourself to the mercy of the snack machines: Pick a hotel that offers a mini-fridge in the room. Before you book it, Lebwohl suggests you see if there is a grocery store nearby so you can pick up foods that don’t trigger your symptoms."
