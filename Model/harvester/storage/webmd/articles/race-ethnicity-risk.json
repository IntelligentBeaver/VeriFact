        "All women should be aware of their risk for breast cancer . It can affect women of every age, race, and ethnic group. However, the rates of developing and dying from breast cancer vary among different racial and ethnic groups.",
        "According to the National Cancer Institute, white, non-Hispanic women have the highest overall incidence rate for breast cancer among U.S. racial/ethnic groups. Native Americans and native Alaskans have the lowest rate. Among women under age 40, African-American women have a higher incidence of breast cancer than white women. African-American women also have the highest death rate from breast cancer. Native Americans and native Alaskans, along with Asian-American women, have the lowest death rate.",
        "Several factors have been found to affect the breast cancer incidence and death rates among racial and ethnic groups. Differences in certain lifestyle behaviors -- such as diet , exercise, smoking, and alcohol use -- can influence the risk of many diseases, including heart disease and breast cancer.",
        "The higher death rate from breast cancer among African American women has been linked to the stage, or extent, of the cancer at the time of diagnosis. Studies show that African-American women tend to seek treatment when their cancers are more advanced and there are less treatment options. A higher death rate in this population may also in part be due to a higher rate of triple negative (hormone receptor negative, HER2-negative) breast cancers diagnosed in African-American women."
