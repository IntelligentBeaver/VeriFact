        "June 12, 2025 -- Over 100,000 Americans are waiting for life-saving kidney transplants , with 17 dying each day. Why isn’t universal donation enough? Could xenotransplantation – transplanting gene-edited organs from other species into humans – be the answer? We sat down with Sanjay Gupta, MD , CNN’s chief medical correspondent, to unpack his documentary Animal Pharm and explore the promise and perils of this scientific frontier. We dive into his visits to biosecure pig facilities, ethical questions across faiths, and concerns around infection, cost, and organ rejection. Dr. Gupta also looks ahead to the potential use of pig hearts, lungs, and livers. Tune in for a rare blend of hope, controversy, and cutting-edge science."

        "Welcome to the WebMD Health Discovered Podcast. I'm Dr Neha Pathak, WebMD's Chief Physician Editor for Health and Lifestyle Medicine. Imagine learning that a new kidney or heart—the one treatment guaranteed to save your life—is just out of reach. That's the reality for more than a hundred thousand Americans who are currently on a transplant waitlist. Seventeen people on the waitlist die every single day, and even universal organ donation wouldn't be enough to meet the need. Today, we're going to discuss xenotransplantation, the bold frontier of transplanting lifesaving organs from animals to humans. This practice is being studied as we speak, using genetically engineered pigs. We'll take a step-by-step approach to the science, the controversies, and the potential impact of xenotransplantation on those waiting for organs—whether they're kidneys, hearts, or potentially others in the future. We'll discuss what it's like to wake up with an organ that originated from another species.",

We'll talk through the experience and learn more about the burning questions: Will transplant recipients still need anti-rejection medications? When could my loved one actually be offered a pig kidney? What do ethicists, including people from different faith traditions, have to say about receiving a non-human organ?"

        "Pathak: I watched your documentary with my daughter and it was really interesting because I think there's such an interesting intersection of a couple of things. There's hope for these patients that are very sick and are tied to a dialysis machine when we're thinking about end-stage kidney failure. There's also this cutting-edge science that’s almost in the science fiction realm. You know, watching her just sort of be amazed and awed by the science. And then there were also pieces that can be somewhat controversial. So it's a really interesting intersection of all of these things that come up as we sort of push the barriers of what science can do to improve our health. So I'd love to start with where we are in our current state. Why are we pushing these barriers?",
        "Gupta: Well, you know, the idea of a transplant waiting list—people who are sick and dying, oftentimes waiting for an organ—it is one of the most human stories. Neha, I think as physicians, that we deal with. We know there's an answer. We know that there's a cure for many of these people: kidney transplant. So there's that hope, and yet there are so many people who are waiting—100,000 or so people. Seventeen people die every day, and these numbers sometimes wash over you, but I think when you do a documentary, you get to meet these people. You spend time with the families of people who lost loved ones waiting. So can you imagine knowing that there was an answer to have helped your loved one, and yet, because of where we are in society right now, they never got that opportunity? So that is, I think, what's driving this more than anything else. And then you couple that with some extraordinary figures. And if you look at most medical advancements, ultimately they had a champion. They had some sort of super, super passionate advocate around this. And that’s the same thing with xenotransplantation as well. So I think it’s a combination of need, where we have come with science—gene editing—and then a few very, very passionate individuals. One of the guys—you know, having watched the documentary—is a guy who had seven cardiac arrests himself, thought he was going to die, ultimately got a heart transplant, but only after he was really, really sick—almost dead. And he became a transplant surgeon. So he turned that into his life’s calling, and he’s the one who I think is one of the real champions of this whole concept of xenotransplantation, at least modern-day xenotransplantation."

        "It really strikes me as you're talking. Some of these numbers are so staggering. It's hard to really understand what we're talking about in terms of the human toll, but we're talking about 37 million adults—if we're just talking about kidney disease—with chronic kidney disease, 800,000 of them with end-stage kidney failure, and to your point, 100,000 people waiting on an organ transplant list.",
        "Gupta: Yeah.",
        "Pathak: So why is it so hard to find human organs for transplant?",
        "Gupta: So this is a really interesting question because this surprised me. I often thought that this was an issue of: Are there enough donors? Are there enough people who are willing to say, “Look, upon my death—my brain death—I’m willing to be an organ donor”? And it turns out it’s far more nuanced than that because, again, as was explained to me by Dr Robert Montgomery, a very small percentage of people die every day in the United States in a way that is suitable for their organs to be transplanted. So, they have significant disease—sometimes they have cancer that has made their organs unusable. Sometimes they're too old—many times they're too old. I mean, most of the organ donors—and this is tough to talk about—but the ideal organ donor is young, healthy, and then suddenly dead. That is not how most people die, thankfully, you know? So even if every single person in the country said, “I will be an organ donor,” you still would not have enough organs in this country to satisfy the demand. And keep in mind, the demand that you’re talking about—again, the 100,000 people on the waiting list—that’s a really pared-down demand. There are a lot of people who spend the rest of their lives on dialysis. They may never qualify for a kidney transplant. But if you suddenly have more organs available, you could suddenly expand the criteria for transplantation as well. So you could not only save lives, but improve lives as well. So it’s a really interesting societal problem, but I think that’s another reason it’s being driven by these new technologies."

        "That’s really interesting. I had not even thought of that. And then, add to that, when you do have an organ donor that can donate their organs, there’s this concern around matching that has to be taken very seriously. So then that brings us to the science around CRISPR. If we’re already having trouble matching human-to-human organs, how has this science really helped us shift from being able to then match a pig kidney to a human, given all of these considerations amongst humans?",
        "Gupta: I think there's two sort of paths that we're talking about here. One is, can you take a pig genome—the genetic blueprint for a pig—and make it compatible with the human genome? So this would essentially create a situation where the pig's genome is no different than human genomes. They would still have the same challenges that you're talking about. You'd still need to have matches, you'd still have issues of rejection, but it would be no greater than if a human were to donate to another human. Ultimately, with even better gene editing, you could get to the point where you start to more personalize organs. So I'm not just trying to make this compatible for all humans. I'm trying to make this compatible for a specific human. We're not really at that point yet. So, there's two main companies that are working on this—bio companies. One is doing 69 gene edits to the pig. And these edits are for everything from looking at issues of a particular protein that a pig may make, that if you put that protein into a human, they would immediately reject it. So you're getting rid of those specific parts of the genome right away. And then you're doing other things. You know, the way pigs clot their blood is a little different than humans. So you're changing some of those, and then you're adding some genes from humans into the pig genome as well, called transgenes. So when you add all that up, there's one company that does 69 gene edits, another one that says, “We just need 10 gene edits to make this compatible with humans.” It's really interesting—and you know this—but I think a lot of people don't realize how similar the pig genome is to a human genome. It's actually very, very similar. But some of these edits that happen make it much more compatible. Ultimately, I think we'll get to the point where you can start to get even more specific."

        "Can you talk a little bit about what that experience was like touring these BioE secure pig facilities?",
        "Gupta: Yeah. So this idea—at what point, conception to birth—you know, it's interesting because we talked about CRISPR, this gene editing technology, but in order for this to work, there were really several Nobel Prize–winning discoveries that went into effect. So first of all, you took a pig cell—and you can take that from anywhere, from a pig's ear or anything—you essentially took out the DNA of that cell and then replaced it with this gene-edited DNA. That is a process known as IVF. We talk about that in humans all the time, but you're essentially doing IVF on these pigs, and then you clone those cells over and over again. So you, first, are doing gene editing, then you're cloning, and then you're basically implanting that through IVF to the sow—the mother pig. So it's those sows then that you see on these pig farms, which are basically these huge, biotechnologically sophisticated facilities. They're super clean. I mean, as was explained to me, the water and the air for the pigs is cleaner than what most humans would have on a daily basis—even the humans who work in that facility. So one of the big concerns is you want to keep these pigs as clean as possible. You worry about infections and things like that. So it's a really, really sophisticated facility, which does raise the issue, I think ultimately, of cost and scalability and all those sorts of things. But it was pretty remarkable. And there's a few of these facilities in the country right now. When you talk to the people who are at the forefront of this, they imagine these sorts of pig farms with organs suitable for human donation popping up all over the country—and frankly all over the world.",
        "Pathak: So let's talk about where we are right now in the process of xenotransplantation—from compassionate care uses to pilot studies and now this FDA-approved clinical trial. Can you talk to us a little bit about that journey?"

          "text": "Gupta: Yeah. So this idea—at what point, conception to birth—you know, it's interesting because we talked about CRISPR, this gene editing technology, but in order for this to work, there were really several Nobel Prize–winning discoveries that went into effect. So first of all, you took a pig cell—and you can take that from anywhere, from a pig's ear or anything—you essentially took out the DNA of that cell and then replaced it with this gene-edited DNA. That is a process known as IVF. We talk about that in humans all the time, but you're essentially doing IVF on these pigs, and then you clone those cells over and over again. So you, first, are doing gene editing, then you're cloning, and then you're basically implanting that through IVF to the sow—the mother pig. So it's those sows then that you see on these pig farms, which are basically these huge, biotechnologically sophisticated facilities. They're super clean. I mean, as was explained to me, the water and the air for the pigs is cleaner than what most humans would have on a daily basis—even the humans who work in that facility. So one of the big concerns is you want to keep these pigs as clean as possible. You worry about infections and things like that. So it's a really, really sophisticated facility, which does raise the issue, I think ultimately, of cost and scalability and all those sorts of things. But it was pretty remarkable. And there's a few of these facilities in the country right now. When you talk to the people who are at the forefront of this, they imagine these sorts of pig farms with organs suitable for human donation popping up all over the country—and frankly all over the world.",

I'll tell you one interesting thing to get there: in terms of compassionate use—for a long time, people have been talking about xenotransplantation. Forty-five years they've been talking about this, even tried it in the past, and they just couldn't get buy-in from the FDA to say, “Hey look, let's try this in living humans.” So what these guys—primarily at NYU, but a few other facilities around the country—started to think about was this idea of trying to do a xeno transplant into a human patient who was brain-dead. Which was—you can imagine—the ethical discussions around this, getting it through institutional review boards and all that, and getting the family to buy in. So these were patients who said, “We want to donate our organs upon our death,” but for whatever reason, as we talked about, they were not suitable organ donors. But what they were, were suitable organ recipients. So these first patients that were done in this most recent phase of xenotransplantation were brain-dead. So they took a kidney from a pig and they put it into a patient who was brain-dead, and they basically followed them for a month, a couple of months. They could do all sorts of things. They could biopsy the kidney every day if they wanted. They could measure everything in these patients. And they did. And I think that's really what landed us where we are today. Once they started to get some good data back from those initial patients, that got the approval for a pilot study that led to an FDA-approved clinical trial.

        "Yeah. I mean, this particular issue of xenotransplantation touches on just about every ethical issue you can imagine. There's a doctor who's a cardiac surgeon out of the University of Maryland who is Pakistani.

You know, in terms of like, “What—do you like pigs? We don't consume pigs. How can you possibly think about pigs being used as organ donors?” Same thing in the Jewish faith. So this was, I think, a big concern for people. And Art Kaplan, I think, is the ethicist you're talking about, who also works at NYU with these other transplant surgeons. He spent a lot of time going to faith leaders and saying, “How do you sort of balance saving a life with these traditions with regard to your faith?” Same thing with Catholicism. One of our organ recipients, a devout Catholic, reached out to the Vatican—“How do you think about the autonomy of animals when it comes to donation?” So there were all these discussions that were happening in the background. Leave aside the scientific principles—were we ready for that? Could we gene-edit well enough? Could we keep pigs clean enough? These faith-based discussions were some of the most fascinating, as well as discussions with organizations like PETA—People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. I think the question of what is an animal’s autonomy—are they here just to serve humans, in terms of providing organs, in this case, or providing food supply and things like that? You get wildly divergent views. But as you might guess, because this is moving forward, I think those discussions have been had. And I think most people felt comfortable enough with it—not PETA, by the way. And I give PETA a lot of credit because they are very consistent in their staunch opposition to this sort of thing.

  "meta_description": "Over 100,000 Americans are waiting for life-saving kidney transplants, with 17 dying each day. Why isn’t universal donation enough? Could xenotransplantation – transplanting gene-edited organs from other species into humans – be the answer? We sat down with Sanjay Gupta, MD, CNN’s chief medical correspondent, to unpack his documentary Animal Pharm and explore the promise and perils of this scientific frontier. We dive into his visits to biosecure pig facilities, ethical questions across faiths, and concerns around infection, cost, and organ rejection. Dr. Gupta also looks ahead to the potential use of pig hearts, lungs, and livers. Tune in for a rare blend of hope, controversy, and cutting-edge science.",
