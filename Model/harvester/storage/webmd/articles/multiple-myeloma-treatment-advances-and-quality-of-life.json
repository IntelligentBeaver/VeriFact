        "Feb. 6, 2024 -- Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer that affects plasma cells in the bone marrow. And it most commonly impacts older adults, with higher prevalence among men and African Americans. What are the symptoms and signs that are often subtle or overlooked, leading to delays in diagnosis? What treatment options are available for those diagnosed? In this episode spoke with Jens Hillengass, MD, PhD , chief of the Myeloma and Amyloidosis Service and vice chair of research of the Department of Medicine at Roswell Park Cancer Institute about the importance of early detection, healthy lifestyle strategies, and recent advances in research that offer hope. We then sat down with Jacqueline Henry, BSN, RN, nurse manager for the lymphoma and myeloma department at Roswell Park, about what quality of life looks like for patients, treatment goals, and how to find hope after diagnosis."
