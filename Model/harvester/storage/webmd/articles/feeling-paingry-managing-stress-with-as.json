I know this isn’t the best way to handle stress. I have been working on handling my stress in a more productive way. Here is what I’m trying to help me handle stress.",
        "We have been dealing with some major health issues with our son this last year. There are fewer things more stressful than watching your child hurting, and there is nothing you can do. When I’m stressed, my whole body gets tense, and then the pain comes. This doesn’t do anyone any good. So, when I feel it getting worse, I try to head it off at the pass. If I’m out in public, that may be as simple as finding a quiet place and reading. I have all of my books on my Kindle, so I always have something to read."

Yes, my feet may hurt, but why? Are my shoes to blame? Have I been on my feet too long without a break? I know this sounds simple, but different pain can cause different kinds of stress."
