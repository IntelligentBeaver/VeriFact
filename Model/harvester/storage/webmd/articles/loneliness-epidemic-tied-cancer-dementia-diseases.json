        "July 6, 2023 – Loneliness, once considered a mere longing for connection, is gaining recognition from doctors and scientists as something much more dangerous: a risk for heart disease, dementia, certain cancers, and even death.",
        "A growing body of research points to strong links between social isolation, or lack of social connections, and loneliness, the feeling of being disconnected regardless of human contact. Researchers have found a 26% increase in the risk of early death for people who are socially isolated and a 14% increase for those who are lonely, according to a new meta-analysis published in Nature Human Behaviour.",
        "Loneliness also increases the risk of dementia by 50%, heart disease by 29%, and stroke by 32%, according to a 2020 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM). If a person with heart disease experiences loneliness, they face four times the risk of early death and a 68% higher risk of hospitalization.",
        "“In recent years, people have recognized that loneliness, as well as social isolation, are related to worse health status,” said Sarah Goodlin, MD, a geriatrician, palliative care doctor, and professor of medicine at Oregon Health & Science University. “And it’s a common condition. Even people who are not socially isolated can feel lonely.”"
