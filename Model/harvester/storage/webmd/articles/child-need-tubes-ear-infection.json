        "Ear tubes are very small tubes that a doctor inserts in a person's ear to help drain fluid or pus. They are typically used to reduce ear infections in your child. Most children have at least one ear infection by the age of 5. But if they keep returning or if your child has hearing loss because of fluid buildup, ear tubes can provide relief for your child. They also prevent long-term hearing problems.",

        "Ear tubes -- also called tympanostomy tubes, ventilation tubes, myringotomy tubes, or pressure equalization tubes -- look like a small section of a tiny drinking straw. They’re round, hollow, and usually made of metal or plastic. Your doctor makes a small opening in the eardrum and puts in the tube to let air into the middle ear."
