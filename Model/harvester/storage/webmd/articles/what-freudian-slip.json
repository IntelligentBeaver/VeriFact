In such cases, the harder we try to avoid thinking of something, the more likely we are to unintentionally verbalize it, causing a Freudian slip.",

This means that if you speak around 150 words a minute, you’ll make around seven to 22 verbal errors in a usual day, depending on how talkative you are.
