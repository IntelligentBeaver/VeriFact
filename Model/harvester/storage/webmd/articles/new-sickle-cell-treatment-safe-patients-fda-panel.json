        "Nov. 1, 2023 – A breakthrough genetic therapy that can potentially cure sickle cell disease is poised for approval by the FDA in December.",
        "The treatment, called exa-cel, received a positive critique of its safety from an important FDA advisory panel during a 7-hour meeting on Tuesday. Exa-cel is a gene-editing treatment that changes the body’s process for making red blood cells.",
        "Sickle cell disease leads to abnormal blood flow in the body that can cause eye problems, infections, and severe pain episodes. The disease is highly linked to early death, often from a stroke or infection. People with the disease have an average life span of 43 years, according to the CDC .",
        "Currently, the only cure is a bone marrow transplant, which is often not an option due to the rarity of finding a matched donor.",

Before the infusion, the person’s stem cells are edited in a lab and the person must have chemotherapy, according to a summary from the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America ."
