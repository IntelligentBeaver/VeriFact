        "I went from having gestational diabetes to type 2 diabetes . I’ve been managing my diabetes for 15 years. This has been an emotional journey. It started out with me being in denial because I didn’t want to come to terms with my disease. Next, it was dealing with the depression of trying to cope with having diabetes. Lastly, it was acceptance or coming to terms. I have diabetes, so I had to make changes in my life.",
        "This is when I finally realized I had to make some major changes in my life to live with diabetes. I did a lot of research to see what information was available to help me understand what diabetes was all about. During this process, I learned I had to see several different medical professionals to aid in the success of my diabetes care and management. My health care team consisted of a nutritionist, primary care doctor, and registered nurse to check in with me regularly to monitor my progress."

        "This was a major change for me because I never had this much hands-on support for my health care in the past. However, I learned it was “absolutely necessary.” The nutritionist taught me how to read food labels and told me about good carbs versus bad carbs. She taught me that carbs can turn into sugar, but carbs are necessary for a balanced meal.",
        "She taught me the importance of choosing the right foods and portion control. She explained that when you overeat, it affects your glucose numbers. She taught me that getting proper rest is equally as important as making the right food choices. She said that exercise is a key element to managing diabetes, even if you only work out as little as 15 minutes a day.",
        "Speaking with the nutritionist brought a level of comfort to my health care management because she was understanding. She wanted to ensure that I understood the seriousness of my disease and what could happen if I don’t manage my diabetes. For example, she said I could be placed on insulin, I could have a heart attack or stroke, I could suffer from kidney failure or even go blind. Hearing how severe the adverse effects could be and wanting to be there for my son made me want to do the right thing so I can live. I knew this would take time and wouldn’t happen overnight, but I was willing to make these changes."

Both of you are a team; you’re in this together.",

I must admit it took a while to get here, but the victory was I was able to achieve this very important milestone in my diabetes journey. I didn’t know that I could do it. However, through the encouragement of Dr. Chary, his staff, and my health care team, I was able to achieve managing my diabetes. It feels good to know that I could do it. You can too!"
