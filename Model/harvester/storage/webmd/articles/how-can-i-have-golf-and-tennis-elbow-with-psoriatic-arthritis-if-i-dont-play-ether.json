        "Several years ago, I went into the orthopedic surgeon’s office with severe right elbow pain. The pain was causing my elbow to swell on both sides of my arm, and there was redness, tenderness, and heat that could be felt before even touching my elbow. He told me that I had both golf and tennis elbow. I found that incredibly unbelievable since I didn’t play either sport. He told me that you didn’t have to play either sport, but it can be caused by frequent and repetitive movements of the elbow. I told him there was absolutely nothing that I was doing with my right arm that would include repetitive motion of my elbow.",
        "I have psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and I have pain all the time. I have pain in my joints and around my joints. Enthesitis can be caused by repeat motion putting stress on tendons and ligaments where they attach to the bone, but that is not always the case when you have PsA. Enthesitis can occur in people with PsA without the repetitive movement and can affect the elbow, causing pain and inflammation in the area where tendons and ligaments meet the bone in the elbow. The pain can also radiate to the wrist and forearm, which is exactly what happened to me. If I didn’t have all the swelling, I wouldn’t have known it originated from the elbow area at times. I found that the pain was mostly worse in the morning after being immobile all night long.",
        "My golf and tennis elbow was indeed enthesitis caused by my PsA, and it has become a chronic problem for me. I was told to take NSAIDs and go to physical therapy. I continue to use oral NSAIDs or the topical NSAIDs that can be applied to the skin on the elbow via a cream. I go to the physical therapist whenever my enthesitis flares in my elbow, and I continue my at-home exercises that were taught to me. I make sure to stretch and also do strengthening exercises with light weights and bands, and I use ice and heat with inflammation flares. On occasion, I do see my orthopedic surgeon and receive a steroid injection into my elbow joint. That lasts a few months at least."

        "Being on a treatment plan for PsA that works as soon as possible helps prevent further damage to the joint and surrounding tissues. Make sure to see all doctors that will help with your plan of care. I see a rheumatologist for my biologic, and an orthopedic surgeon for injections and to order physical therapy. I had one surgery on my elbow to release the nerve that was entrapped due to the inflammation from the enthesitis. I had been seeing my orthopedic surgeon regularly. And of course there are other doctors and health care workers to see for your complete plan of care with PsA for other things besides enthesitis.",
