Or you were in a quiet movie theater, or thought you were alone, but it turned out you weren’t. Embarrassing? Oh, yes. But take heart : Gas -- farting , belching, whichever end it comes out of and whatever you call it -- happens to us all.",
        "In fact, most people pass gas around 13 to 21 times a day. That’s normal.",

When you’re out with friends, at work, or sharing an intimate moment, nothing kills a good time like worrying about whether you’ll let one slip on accident. Between your physical pain and the anxiety in your mind, having excess gas can be a drag.",
        "But there’s good news: Truly excessive gas is pretty rare. Even if you think you’ve got a bad case, chances are you probably fall somewhere in the normal range."
