While not a replacement for basal insulin (type 1 diabetes still requires shots or an insulin pump for steady, continuous management), it can provide a helpful boost of insulin after meals or workouts. Because it works fast – in and out of the body in about an hour and a half to three hours – it may help reduce the risk of reactive hypoglycemia , low blood sugar after a meal. For example, it may benefit those who carb-load before exercise, helping process the carbs without lingering too long and causing lows after the workout.",

Developed by Mannkind Corporation (Afrezza's maker), the technology involves tiny particles that hold the insulin inside and are just the right size to be breathed into the lungs. When you inhale the powder, it dissolves quickly, allowing it to be absorbed into the bloodstream rapidly."
