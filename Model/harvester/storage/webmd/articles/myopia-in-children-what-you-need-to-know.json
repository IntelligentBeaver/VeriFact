        "Myopia, better known as nearsightedness or shortsightedness, is the most common eye disorder in the world. A child’s refractive state -- which determines their prescription -- changes throughout childhood and often stabilizes into adolescence.",
        "Myopia is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. A child is twice as likely to have myopia if one parent has it, and five times more likely to have myopia when both parents are nearsighted.",
        "While we can’t change our genetics, we can change our environment.  Studies have shown that 76 minutes of outdoor time per day can reduce the risk of developing myopia by 50%.  If your child hasn’t developed myopia, 2 hours of outdoor time may help prevent it if at least one parent has myopia.  It’s unclear if outdoor time helps once myopia has developed, but this is a relatively easy behavioral modification to make.",
        "Distance can also impact myopia progression. Doing tasks from shorter distances of about 8 inches or less can help lessen myopia progression. The size of tech devices children use to do certain tasks can also have an impact. During the COVID-19 lockdown, children between the ages of  7 and 12 years old who learned remotely on a television or projector progressed less than those who learned on smartphones and tablets."

        "Therefore, parents should encourage children to watch television on a larger screen as opposed to tablets. All in all, however, parents should limit screen time as much as possible – especially on smaller screens like smartphones. Children on tablets should also be using them from further away -- at least 8 inches. Parents should limit screen time by using the 20-20-20 rule for their kids. This means taking a  screen break every 20 minutes and focusing on an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds before going back to the screen.",

        "In addition to glasses and contact lenses, you can try a course of low-dose atropine to slow myopic progression. Atropine is a nonselective muscarinic receptor blocker thought to inhibit scleral thinning and eye growth. Keep in mind, however, that using atropine comes with rebound risks if you stop using it. Higher doses may have better effects on myopic progression but could cause side effects like blurred near vision and light sensitivity. If this happens, bifocals and photochromic lenses can help.",
