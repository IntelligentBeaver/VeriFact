        "When I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 1989, there were no drugs to treat the condition. If you had a relapse, they would give a few weeks of steroids and you could get medicines for symptoms, but the basic illness could not be prevented, reversed, or even slowed down.",
        "When my neurologist told me my diagnosis, I asked him, “So what do I do now?” He shrugged and said, “Tie your shoes so you don’t trip, and call me in 6 months.”",
        "I didn’t mind the absence of a treatment because as a nurse, I knew about the loss of control, the hassles, side effects, and the expense of drug therapies. I tried to live as well as possible and waited for therapies to come along. I didn’t even watch too hard to see what has happening with research. I knew friends and family would tell me if they saw anything about MS in the news."

        "Then in 1996, the first disease-modifying treatment (DMT), a drug called Avonex, came out, followed closely by two others, Betaseron and Copaxone. These three became known as the ABC drugs. Some people in my MS support group started taking them.",

Early studies found ABC users had fewer relapses, but their long term progression of disability was not better than placebo. (Those results have improved some in later studies.)",

        "I kept thinking, how many poor families could have their lives dramatically improved with the money I’d be spending on a drug that might or might not help me a little bit? Looking at drug company web sites showed me they didn’t even know how the drugs supposedly worked. They didn’t make you better; you could only guess if you’d be worse off without them."

In 2004, a new type of drug came out and a woman named Pat in my support group started taking it. She got dramatically better, went from walking with a cane to skiing and riding a bike, telling us all to consider taking it.",
        "Most previous drugs had been interferons. They worked by “interfering” with immune system response, hopefully reducing inflammation. According to MS Society UK, interferons may also encourage growth of oligodendrocytes cells, which may repair damaged nerve cells. This medicine was different: a monoclonal antibody or MAB. MABs are proteins designed to bind specific cells, in this case the B cells that attack nerve sheaths in MS. It sounded worth a try, and Pat was doing so well! So I asked my doctor for a prescription.",
        "It was hugely expensive, about $5,000 per monthly dose as I recall. Insurance paid most of it, and they probably bargained the price down some. My copay was about $400/month, but I applied for assistance from a charitable assistance program, and they paid most of my copay. So my share was about $40 a month, not a problem."
