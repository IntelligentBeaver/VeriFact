        "Clean your face . It's important to establish a nighttime regimen to remove makeup and build-up from the day. Mascara is the biggest culprit, Weinkle says. Use a soft cloth or mild cleanser to gently wash your skin. A fresh surface will allow creams and lotions to penetrate better. Be diligent about cleaning your face nightly. \"Like brushing your teeth , it has to be a habit,\" Weinkle says. \"It doesn't have to be a lengthy routine. Just keep it nice and simple.\"",
        "Moisturize . Facial moisturizers should be a girl's best friend. The more you hydrate, the better, Weinkle says. Pay special attention to the area around your lips -- try a lip conditioner -- and eyes . A moisturizer with caffeine can help with puffiness around the eyes , she says.",
        "Use retinoids at night . If you only use one product before bed, make it a topical retinoid, Weinkle says. Applying topical retinoids at bedtime , such as tretinoin , or products with retinol, derived from Vitamin A , is recommended because they are light-sensitive and aren't as effective when exposed to UV rays or fluorescent light. Retinoic acid lightens brown spots, thickens the epidermis, makes the skin look more youthful, and stimulates collagen production, she says.",
        "Take your vitamins . Dark circles under the eyes are a common complaint associated with lack of sleep. So what's a tired woman to do? One study found that women who applied an under-eye cream containing vitamin K and retinol nightly for 12 weeks saw a marked improvement in their dark circles.",
        "Switch your sleep position. Sleeping regularly on your side or stomach can cause noticeable sleep lines to appear across your forehead and around the sides of the nose and chin. Sleep lines result from the pressure of lying on a pillow, Derick says. Try sleeping on your back to smooth out and avoid facial wrinkles .",
        "Check your bedroom environment. Dry air from internal heat can wreak havoc on your skin, especially common during the winter months. Consider adding a humidifier to your bedroom. The extra moisture in the air will help prevent your skin from drying out. Derick recommends wearing cotton pajamas instead of polyester fabric. It keeps your skin more hydrated, she says.",
        "Brew your own home remedy. Joanna Czech, an esthetician in New York City, highly recommends utilizing scrubs with oatmeal and dandelion tea bags to reduce puffy eyes. She creates her own healing mask for bedtime using a combination of oatmeal, flaxseed , and hot water. Soak your feet with Epsom salt at night and sprinkle in sage if you tend to sweat a lot. Add lavender to create a spa environment, she says."
