        "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disease in which fluid-filled lumps called cysts grow on the kidneys. Eventually the cysts can get big enough to damage the two blood-filtering organs. ADPKD is passed down from parents to their children. Often, it affects many people in the same family. If one of your parents has this disease, you could have it too. And because ADPKD can lead to kidney failure, it's important to learn your family history and know about your chances of getting the disease. If you are at risk for ADPKD, your doctor can test you for it. If you have it, they can treat you to slow the kidney damage."

PKD1 causes 85% of ADPKD cases. PKD2 causes the other 15%. People with the PKD1 gene mutation have more severe symptoms. Their kidneys also go into failure faster than those with the PKD2 mutation."

It can show cysts on your kidneys before you have symptoms. During this test, a technician places a device called a transducer on the skin over your kidneys. The transducer releases sound waves that bounce off of your kidneys. A computer then converts those sound waves into a picture of your kidneys. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI ) scans are other imaging tests that can detect cysts. Genetic tests are another way to find out if you have this disease, but they are expensive. There are two kinds of gene tests for PKD. Both involve a blood test: Gene linkage compares segments of your DNA with those of family members who have ADPKD. Both you and a few of your relatives will need to provide blood samples. This test is 99%  accurate at showing whether you have the disease."
