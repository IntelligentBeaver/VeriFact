        "Osteopathic doctors focus on treating the whole person rather than just the specific symptoms or body parts. Osteopathic medicine is based on the idea that all the body’s systems are interrelated. There were about 149,000 doctors of o steopathic medicine in the U.S. in 2023, a 30% increase in the past 5 years. And more than 1 in 4 U.S. medical students are on the path to becoming a doctor of osteopathic medicine (DO).",

        "DOs are trained in the same way as MDs and can diagnose and treat ailments, perform surgery, and prescribe drugs. But DOs get extra training in manipulating the musculoskeletal system. This is your body's interconnected system of nerves, muscles, and bones. All DOs are trained in osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), sometimes called osteopathic manual manipulation or osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM). This is a hands-on method to help diagnose and treat illnesses. Not all DOs use it regularly in their practice, though.",
        "If you visit an osteopath with, say, knee pain , they are likely to look at more than just your knee. To prevent or treat health issues, DOs pay extra attention to how all your body parts work together.",
        "DOs have held prominent medical positions in the U.S., for instance, as part of a NASA medical team. They also have been primary physicians for presidents from both political parties."
