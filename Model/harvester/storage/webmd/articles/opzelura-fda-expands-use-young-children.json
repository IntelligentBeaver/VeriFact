        "Opzelura (ruxolitinib) is a prescription cream that helps reduce skin inflammation. It works by blocking certain proteins in the body called Janus kinases (JAKs) that help regulate the immune system and can cause skin inflammation when overactive.",
        "The FDA has now approved this cream for children as young as 2 years old with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (also known as eczema) in whom other prescription creams don’t work well or aren’t suitable for certain reasons.",
        "This matters because Opzelura is a first-of-its-kind steroid-free skin cream approved in the U.S. for young children with eczema, a long-term skin condition caused by an overactive immune system. Affecting about 2 million to 3 million children in the U.S., eczema causes itchy, irritated skin with red oozing patches that can crust over. Opzelura offers a short-term treatment providing temporary relief and improving daily comfort.",
        "Why Was It Approved?",
        "Opzelura was approved for children based on a clinical trial involving over 300 kids with eczema that showed that the cream is safe and effective for treating eczema in young children."

For children aged 2 to 11, you also shouldn’t use more than one 60-gram tube every two weeks. Do not apply Opzelura in your child’s mouth, eyes, or groin area."
