        "Vasculitis is a general term that refers to inflammation of blood vessels. Vasculitis can affect very small blood vessels (capillaries), medium-sized blood vessels (arterioles and venules), or large blood vessels ( arteries and veins). If blood flow in a vessel with vasculitis is reduced or stopped, the tissues that receive blood from that vessel begin to die.",

There are also types of vasculitis that may affect many organ systems at the same time. Some of these generalized forms may be quite mild and may not require treatment. Others may be severe, affecting critical organs."

        "In most cases, the cause of vasculitis is unknown; however, it is clear that the immune system (the system that keeps the body healthy) plays a role. While the immune system usually works to protect the body, it can sometimes become overactive, attacking parts of the body. Sometimes, an allergic reaction to certain medicines can trigger the immune system to go awry. In other cases, the origins may be traced to recent or ongoing infections, such as those caused by certain viruses.",
