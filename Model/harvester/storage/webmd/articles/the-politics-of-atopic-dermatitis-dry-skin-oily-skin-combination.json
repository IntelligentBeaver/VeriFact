        "My understanding was something that can be described as “vibes only.” I know that dry skin means you have to moisturize more; oily skin makes your face more shiny in comparison; combination skin, given the obvious context, is a mixture between the two. One would think there are countless factors that would make sorting an individual into such a few categories a complicated process. Three choices don't account for how your skin might adapt to the winter or the weather of different places while you travel, or the ingredients that work better for your lotion.",
        "But three choices also help you narrow down all of those if s and but s. When learning to deal with eczema, a lot of the tips and tricks dedicated to people with dry skin helped me more than hacks intended for people with oily skin. It's all trial and error. A personalization of trying until you find the right ways to treat your skin."
