With some products, it’s essential to test a small area of skin (called a patch test) to make sure the medication won’t cause further irritation. If you’re using a topical steroid, apply only a small amount to the areas of your skin impacted by psoriasis. The standard amount is one fingertip to cover the area of about two adult-sized palms. Unless your doctor says it’s OK, don’t apply a topical steroid near your eye area. This can cause eye problems such as cataracts and glaucoma ."
