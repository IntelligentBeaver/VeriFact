We used to co-lead an MS support group together, but 5 years ago, she moved to assisted living across the Bay. COVID basically shut down the support group we led, and our visits slowed to like once every 3 months. I missed her.",
        "On Thursday, Jane invited me to come to the Cherry Festival in San Leandro where she lives. There would be four blocks of music, crafts, vendors, and street food, just the kind of event I like, and I had baked some special brownies for her."

My muscles get weaker, and my mind gets fuzzier. I hadn’t checked the weather before I left, but even if I had, I probably would have come, because I had decided MS wasn’t going to rule me for this one day.",
