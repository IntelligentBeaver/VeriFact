        "Doctors use a different form of it: radioactive iodine. A substance that’s radioactive gives off a form of energy so intense that it’s capable of harming the body. But doctors have harnessed that power. When someone gets a small dose of radioactive iodine, scanners can pick it up, and it can help reveal certain illnesses. Larger doses can attack thyroid cancer , prostate cancer , and other diseases."
