        "Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a rare genetic disease that runs in families. Most often, it affects people whose ancestors came from countries around the Mediterranean Sea and the Middle East. This includes ethnic groups like Arabs, Armenians, Sephardic or North African Jews, Turks, Greeks, and Italians.",
        "FMF is an autoinflammatory syndrome. That means you have recurring episodes of inflammation and fevers related to a defect in your innate immune system. It’s the most common autoinflammatory syndrome. It’s also called hereditary periodic fever syndrome.",

There are more than 300 different MEFV mutations, but only a few cause FMF.",

If you have an MEFV gene mutation, your body doesn’t make enough pyrin. As a result, your immune system may make too much of an inflammatory cytokine called interleukin-1B.
