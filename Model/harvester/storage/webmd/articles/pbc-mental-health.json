They may carry a risk of liver damage, so it’s important that you take them as prescribed and go to all follow-up appointments. Some SSRIs are safer for the liver than others, including: Citalopram (Celexa) Escitalopram (Lexapro) Fluoxetine (prozac) Paroxetine (Paxil) Sertraline (Zoloft) Mirtazipine (Remeron). This is another type of antidepressant called a tetracyclic. It has been shown to have a lower rate of liver damage than some other antidepressants and may also help you sleep better. Other drugs ease physical symptoms of PBC that may affect your quality of life and how you feel emotionally. Cholestyramine , which can remove bile from your blood, is a medication commonly used for itching due to PBC. Studies show that around 5% to 10% of people with ongoing itching from biliary disease have trouble getting enough sleep, depression, and thoughts of suicide."
