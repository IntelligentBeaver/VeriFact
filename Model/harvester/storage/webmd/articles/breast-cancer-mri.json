        "A breast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a test that is sometimes performed along with a screening mammogram in women with at least a 20% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. It is often done in women who have already been diagnosed with breast cancer to measure size and extent of the breast cancer. The American Cancer Society recommends yearly breast MRI and mammogram for high risk patients.",
        "The breast MRI should not be used in lieu of a breast biopsy to distinguish between benign (noncancerous) and malignant (cancerous) areas. Due to false positive results, this test may increase the number of breast biopsies that need to be performed. Although MRI may detect tumors in dense breast tissue, the presence of dense breast tissue is not a reason to have a breast MRI scan. Breast MRI scanning cannot detect tiny specks of calcium (known as microcalcifications), which account for half of the cancers detected by mammography .",
