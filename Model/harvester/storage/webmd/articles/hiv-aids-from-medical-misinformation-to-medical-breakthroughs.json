        "Nov. 30, 2023 -- Forty years ago, the idea that HIV would shift from a terminal illness to a chronic manageable disease was almost unthinkable. In recent years, another health crisis, COVID-19, much like HIV, was wrought with fear, stigma, and misinformation. In honor of World AIDS Day, we'll discuss key terminology, misconceptions, and advancements in HIV, including U=U undetectable equals untransmittable , the life-changing impact of current treatments and medical breakthroughs, and how science has prepared us with tools to navigate future pandemics. Joining us in this conversation is Michael Saag, MD , physician and prominent HIV/AIDS researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and author of Positive: One Doctor's Personal Encounters with Death, Life, and the US Healthcare System . This episode is dedicated to people living with and affected by HIV and those who lost their lives to AIDS ."
