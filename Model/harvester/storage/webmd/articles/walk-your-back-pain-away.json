        "July 1, 2024 – Low back pain is a global problem, with estimates suggesting there are more than a half-billion cases worldwide. Although there are various causes of back pain, it often results from a traumatic event.",
        "You probably know the feeling: Bending over may send a shock of pain, standing too long causes a stiff ache, or even just a minor movement can bring a knee -buckling spasm.",
        "While back pain is a very individual condition, there may be one thing that can help most everyone: Walking.",
        "Researchers in Australia report that a daily walk might be all that it takes to reduce the likelihood that back pain returns. Findings from a newly published study showed that walking just 80 to 130 minutes a week – just 11 to 18 minutes a day – plus expert-provided pain education might be a low-cost, easy solution.",
        "Researchers followed people for up to 6 years.",
        "“Looking at episodes of low back pain that really impacts people’s lives, we found that the intervention actually reduced recurrences by 28%,” said Natasha Pocovi, PhD, a study co-author and a postdoctoral research fellow at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia."
