        "SteadyScrib, a pen designed with these symptoms in mind, seeks to counteract the unsteady tremors of Parkinson’s with pens that have a magnetic core and a pliable grip. The specialized pen is intended to help with three symptoms of Parkinson’s: tremors, slowness of movement, and rigidity.",

The pen, filled with a weighted core and held with a pliable grip, steadies the shaky movement that often impairs a Parkinson’s patient's ability to write. The magnetic force of the pen to the clipboard stabilizes the tip of the pen, and the user can then write legibly with ease.",
