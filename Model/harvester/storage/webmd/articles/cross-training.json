While many people have a favorite activity, it's important to include exercises that address three different areas: strength, cardio (aerobics), and stretching/flexibility. This will help prevent overuse injuries.",
        "Changing things up, instead of repeating the same routine week after week, keeps your body guessing, which can improve your fitness level.",

        "Cross-training vs. CrossFit",
        "CrossFit is a brand name for an exercise program that focuses on high-intensity interval training (HIIT). You might do weight lifting, squats, burpees, and other movements in a CrossFit class. A coach demonstrates the move and sets a timer. Then everyone performs the exercise. When time is over, each participant writes on a whiteboard how many reps they did, how fast they completed them, or how much weight they lifted, depending on the movement. This helps you track your fitness over time.",
        "\" CrossFit is a regimen that combines weight lifting, gymnastics, and calisthenics to build metabolic or cardio/endurance through functional movements,\" says Paul Schroeder, physical therapist and spokesperson for the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA). \"The variety of exercise modes within a session and between exercise session days makes CrossFit an example of cross-training.\"",
        "So, while CrossFit can be a type of cross-training, cross-training is a much broader category of exercise.",

My advice for people getting started with cross-training is to be open-minded to new forms of exercise and to not get frustrated if they seem difficult or challenging.",
        "\"For example, if you are a cyclist who normally bikes for 130 miles per week, then jumps in a pool, swimming laps may prove to be quite tough despite having the cardiovascular capacity to sustain longer bouts on a bicycle.

You can also substitute a jog or walk around the block for a group aerobics class, or use YouTube videos.",

        "These are shoes that can be worn for different kinds of workouts. They tend to have more cushioning and to be slightly heavier than running shoes. They also have more stability for side-to-side motions.",
        "Is cross-training a form of HIIT?",
        "Not exactly. HIIT stands for high-intensity interval training. It's a type of workout where you do short periods of higher-intensity aerobic work followed by lower-intensity intervals. For instance, you might do jumping jacks for three minutes, followed by lunges for three minutes, and then running in place for three minutes. HIIT could take care of your aerobic needs for cross-training, but you'd still need to have strength and stretching sessions.",
        "Is cross-training good for losing weight?",
        "Yes, both aerobic activity and strength training can help you lose weight. But you also have to watch your diet. Most people don't burn enough calories from cross-training (or exercise in general) to compensate for a high-calorie diet. Following a healthy diet will help you lose weight faster, and exercise will help you keep that weight off.",
        "How often should I incorporate cross-training into my workout?",
        "This depends on your goals. If you're a runner, for example, you could include two days of strength training and one day of yoga/Pilates, plus three days of running. Don't forget to take one day off from exercise for recovery each week."
