        "During the surgery, a thin needle called a cryoprobe is inserted through your skin and directly into your tumor. This is done either with local anesthesia or you’ll be “put under” with general anesthesia, so you won’t feel anything.",
        "Or your doctor may insert a long, flexible tube through your throat and down your windpipe, and pass the probe through the tube to access your lungs. This is done under general anesthesia , so you’ll be asleep. The way this surgery is done depends on the size and location of your tumor.",
        "The doctor uses a CT scan (computed tomography scan) to guide the probe to the right spot. Sometimes more than one probe can be used. The surgeon will then pump liquid nitrogen or argon gas through the probe. This freezes the tumor tissue. The tissue is then allowed to thaw, and the freezing step is repeated again. This repeated freeze-thaw cycle kills the cancer cells, and they are absorbed back into the body."
