        "Jan. 23. 2025 – It’s easy to lose sight of nature in winter, amid the rush to escape cold, wet, and gray weather. But there’s another way to approach the season, one expert says: notice nature.",
        "Tuning into the natural world during the darkest, coldest months can give you a mental health boost, according to research by Holli-Anne Passmore , PhD, a nature and well-being expert at the University of Edmonton. You can reap the benefits without changing your behavior or routine – no ice skating or snowshoeing required.",
        "“This isn’t people going out and looking at the Grand Canyon,” Passmore said. “People are looking at a chickadee sitting on a branch eating frozen mountain berries. How pretty the snow looks. How the moon looks at night.”",
        "Passmore previously found that noticing nature improves well-being. But she wondered if people could feel the same positive effects in the winter, a season that can deplete mental health. About 5% of people in the U.S. go through a type of depression typically triggered by the loss of daylight hours."

        "Afterward, she asked the people in the study questions to understand their experiences. Those who noticed nature had  a bigger boost in life satisfaction, connectedness to nature, and \"elevation\" – a composite feeling of being elevated, vital, grateful, moved, and a sense of wonder.",
