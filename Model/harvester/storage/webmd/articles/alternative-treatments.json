Taking an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as aspirin , acetaminophen , or ibuprofen , can help ease the pain of herpes symptoms . Doctors sometimes recommend soaking the affected area in warm water. But the area should be kept dry most of the time. If toweling off after bathing is uncomfortable, try using a hair dryer. Then put on cotton underwear. Cotton absorbs moisture better than synthetic fabric."

The ointment was applied to herpes sores four times a day.
