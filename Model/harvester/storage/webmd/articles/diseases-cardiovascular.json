        "Cardiovascular disease is a group of conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels. It's sometimes also called heart disease. Conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels can include problems you're born with, heart valves that don't work they way they should, and irregular heart rhythms. But when most doctors talk about cardiovascular disease, they are talking about conditions in these four main categories:"
      ],
      "bullets": [
        "Coronary artery disease (CAD) or coronary heart disease (CHD). This is when you have a blockage or narrowing in your coronary arteries, which deliver oxygen-rich blood to your heart. This blockage or narrowing is usually due to cholesterol plaques that build up in your arteries and limit the amount of blood that can get to your heart muscle. CAD is the most common type of heart disease; about 33%-50% of people with cardiovascular disease have CAD. The blockage can cause angina (chest pain), myocardial infarction (a heart attack), and heart failure.",
        "Cerebrovascular disease (CVD). These are conditions that affect the flow of blood to your brain. CVD can cause a stroke and a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is a temporary stroke that's often a warning sign of an actual stroke.",
        "Peripheral artery disease (PAD). This is when you have a blockage or narrowing in your peripheral arteries, which send oxygen-rich blood from your heart to your arms and legs. This can cause pain, trouble walking, and sores on your limbs that won't heal.",
        "Aortic atherosclerosis . This is when you have a blockage or narrowing in your aorta, which is the largest artery in your body. Your aorta runs from your heart to your pelvis, and you can get a blockage anywhere along this length. The most common place, though, is in the section that runs through your belly, or abdomen. When you have a blockage in your aorta, you may not get enough oxygen-rich blood flowing to many of your organs. You're also at an increased risk of an embolus, which is a sudden, complete block of your aorta. This can be due to a blood clot (thromboembolism) or a cholesterol plaque (atheroembolism). Thromboembolism is more common than atheroembolism. Aortic atherosclerosis can also weaken the wall of your aorta, which raises your risk of an aortic aneurysm. An aortic aneurysm is a bulge in your aorta that can be serious or life-threatening if it bursts or splits."

        "Cardiovascular disease, or heart disease, is a group of conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels. These can include problems you're born with, heart valves that don't work the way they should, and an irregular heart rhythm. But when most doctors talk about cardiovascular disease, they're usually talking about coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), or aortic atherosclerosis. These conditions are generally caused by lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in fat, sugar, and sodium or a lack of exercise. If you have symptoms that suggest a heart condition, such as chest pain or discomfort or shortness of breath, it's important for you to go see your doctor because the complications can be life-threatening."

In this case, your doctor will assess how your condition affects your daily life and assign you a stage to indicate that. The stage is usually based on the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. Stage 3 (or III) means that you have a marked limit in your physical activity levels, but you don't have symptoms when you're resting. When you do any sort of physical activity, you may have shortness of breath, chest pain, heart palpitations, and fatigue."
