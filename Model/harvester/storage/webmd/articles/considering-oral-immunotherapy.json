There are times you skip – if you travel by air, if your child is sick, if you go to a high elevation, if your child gets a vaccine, etc. But plan on this being a daily part of your lives for many years. Depending on your particular treatment plan and program, you will likely go to your doctor’s office every two weeks or so to “updose,” your OIT, which means increasing your dose of the allergen by a certain amount. Then you will maintain that dose for the following two weeks until you updose again. Specifics can vary, and you should be able to tailor your program to a schedule that works for you, but either way, there will be s lot of time with your allergist."

My boys are treated at Latitude Food Allergy Care, which now has six offices in the San Francisco and New York City area. I felt comforted knowing that their protocols came directly out of work done by Dr. Kari Nadeau at Stanford University.

We’ve even had two huge FDA approvals recently: peanut allergen powder (Palforzia) for peanut OIT, and Xolair to treat food allergies by reducing reactions that may occur after accidentally ingesting an allergen. There is no better time than now to have an in-depth conversation with your allergist about what might be the best fit for your child."

          "text": "As I mentioned earlier, single dose OIT didn’t make sense for our family. We just had too many allergies to work through them one at a time. We were grateful to find a specialty food allergy treatment center that offered multi-allergen OIT. My boys are treated at Latitude Food Allergy Care, which now has six offices in the San Francisco and New York City area. I felt comforted knowing that their protocols came directly out of work done by Dr. Kari Nadeau at Stanford University. Proven clinical research and transparency were hugely important to me when choosing a treatment clinic. (Disclosure: I serve on the Board of Directors for Latitude, but I share my experience solely as a food allergy parent.)",

We’ve even had two huge FDA approvals recently: peanut allergen powder (Palforzia) for peanut OIT, and Xolair to treat food allergies by reducing reactions that may occur after accidentally ingesting an allergen. There is no better time than now to have an in-depth conversation with your allergist about what might be the best fit for your child.",

Do your research and trust your gut. Only you know what’s best for your child and your family.",
