        "Dawnzera (donidalorsen) is a medicine used to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) . HAE is a rare genetic condition that is caused by a problem with a gene that makes a blood protein called C1 inhibitor. In most cases of HAE, you don’t have enough of this protein. In others, you have normal levels but it doesn’t work right. This causes your body to release too much of a substance called bradykinin. Bradykinin causes blood vessels to widen and swelling that can be painful and life-threatening.",
        "During an HAE attack, swelling happens in different areas of the body, such as your face, hands, feet, gut, or throat. If it affects the gut, it can cause severe stomach pain. If throat swelling occurs, it can be deadly because it can close off your airway. Certain situations or triggers can cause these attacks to happen. Common triggers for attacks include stress, surgery, medical or dental procedures, infections, and tiredness.",
        "Treatment depends on the type of HAE you have and how severe it is. It focuses on avoiding and managing attacks with medicine. Because attacks can happen at any time and are hard to  predict, you need to take medicine regularly to prevent attacks. You also need a rescue medicine (on-demand treatment) readily available to treat breakthrough attacks. HAE medicines work in different ways to stop or prevent your attacks by lowering or preventing too much bradykinin from being made. Dawnzera is a medicine that is approved to prevent HAE attacks in adults and children 12 and older."

        "Medicines called bradykinin inhibitors are used to prevent HAE attacks. The main ingredient in Dawnzera is donidalorsen, a medicine that lowers the amount of a protein called PKK (prekallikrein). PKK is made in the liver and plays a key role in swelling because it causes the release of bradykinin. By lowering PKK levels, Dawnzera used every four or eight weeks prevents too much bradykinin from being made and helps lower the number of HAE attacks."
