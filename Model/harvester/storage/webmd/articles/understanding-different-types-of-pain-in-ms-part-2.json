        "The generosity of multiple sclerosis is infinite, so of course there's more to add about MS pain. I must approach this with my sarcastic sense of humor because I feel like I’m enrolled in the MS rewards program, where I get all perks I didn't sign up for.",

But when I told one of my MS-specialized neurologists that I remembered experiencing Lhermitte’s sign when I was 19, he put the stamp on it as my first official symptom of multiple sclerosis. That means that instead of 7 years, I’ve been living with MS for at least 26 years. Shocker!"
