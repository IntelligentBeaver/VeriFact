        "Lately, I’ve become more aware of my skin changes during my menstrual cycle. Period acne seems to be pretty common due to the fluctuation of hormones. I slowly started paying more attention to psoriasis flares or my skin being flaky sometimes more than usual. I wanted to know more and took a deep dive to see what I could find about women’s hormones and the impact that hormonal changes have on our skin.",
        "As we’re going into our period -- also known as the luteal phase -- and while we are menstruating, our estrogen levels drop, which may cause psoriasis symptoms to worsen. Low estrogen levels increase our body’s immune response, and with psoriasis being considered an autoimmune disease, there has been research to connect the effects of hormones on psoriasis.",
        "The last few months, areas that had been clear for a while started to flare. Some days, certain patches would be flaky, and my typical remedies wouldn’t work. Eventually, I realized it was during my monthly menstrual cycle, where I would get frustrated about areas that I felt I conquered when it came to gaining control with my skin. Stress can greatly affect our hormones and the immune system as well. Combining natural hormonal changes with the stress of living with an autoimmune condition ... MY GOODNESS, GIVE ME A BREAK! Ha ha (but not really).",
        "Having this knowledge now, I’m on the journey of doing what I can to balance my hormones. I’m learning which factors can help, such as certain foods or avoiding endocrine disruptors. Endocrine disruptors are natural or human-made chemicals that mimic, block, or interfere with the body’s hormones. These chemicals are found in many everyday products such as household cleaners, candles, cosmetics, food, pesticides, toys, plastics, the list goes on. I’ve limited plastic as much as possible by switching to glass or stainless steel. I opt for candles made with coconut or beeswax using essential oils vs. fragrances. I do due diligence on laundry detergent, soaps, cleaners, and everything else I can think of. Unfortunately, we cannot completely avoid these disruptors, but we can do what we can to limit our exposure to them."

        "As mentioned in previous blogs, managing stress is so important. Stress management can’t be reiterated enough, especially knowing that stress affects our hormones as well, which can lead to psoriasis flares. Through techniques such as breath work, fitness, and meditation, I’ve found healthy ways to navigate stress, cope during stressful situations, or prevent my body reacting in a negative way to stress. I am also working hard on building my immune system through foods, sunshine, supplements, etc.",
        "Along with the menstrual cycle, hormonal changes occur during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. During some studies, researchers observed that many patients developed their first psoriasis flare just after puberty when hormone levels drop. With pregnancy, hormones fluctuate so every person’s body responds differently. One study showed most pregnant patients saw improvement with psoriasis, with the remaining seeing no change or worsening almost equally. However, during postpartum, a majority had their psoriasis symptoms worsen. During menopause, estrogen levels drop which has been known to cause hot flashes and night sweats. This may also lead to worsening of the skin symptoms and even development of psoriatic arthritis."
