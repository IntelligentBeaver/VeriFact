        "In people with diabetes, high blood sugar damages the walls of the small blood vessels in the eye , altering their structure and function. These vessels may thicken, leak, develop clots, close off, or grow balloon-like defects called microaneurysms. Sometimes, fluid collects in the part of the retina used in tasks such as reading; this condition is called macular edema . In advanced cases, the retina is robbed of its blood supply and grows new, but defective, vessels, a process called neovascularization. These fragile vessels can bleed, creating vision-impairing hemorrhages, scar tissue, and separation of the retina from the back of the eye ( retinal detachment ). The new vessels can also block fluid flow within the eye, producing glaucoma ."

        "Routine screening offers the best hope for early detection of diabetic retinopathy. People with type 1 diabetes should have a complete eye exam within 5 years of diagnosis; those with type 2 should have an eye exam at the time their diabetes is diagnosed. After these initial exams, all people with diabetes should have an eye exam at least once a year. Your doctor may recommend more frequent screenings depending on the severity of retinal damage and other diabetes complications you have.",
        "Pregnancy can lead to or worsen retinopathy in women with diabetes who take insulin, so any such woman considering pregnancy should discuss the risks with their doctor. Your doctor will usually recommend an eye exam before pregnancy , a second exam during the first trimester , and additional exams at intervals based on the status of your retinopathy. Women who suddenly develop diabetes during a pregnancy ( gestational diabetes ) are not at risk of developing retinopathy during the pregnancy.",

Smoking is also a culprit: Consult with your doctor about methods for quitting. Never ignore the symptoms of infection, which can worsen diabetic retinopathy.

Depending on the severity of your diabetes and related complications, you may also want to discuss the options of pancreas and kidney transplants, which may protect against retinopathy."
