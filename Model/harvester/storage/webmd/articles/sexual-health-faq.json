        "Menopause is a term used to describe the end of a woman's fertility. It literally means the end of menstruation. Female menopause is characterized by changes in hormone production. Men do go through a form of menopause, but obviously, it is different from that of a woman. The male testes, unlike the woman's ovaries, do not lose the ability to make hormones. A healthy male may be able to make sperm well into their 80's or longer.",
        "On the other hand, subtle changes in the function of the testes may occur as early as 45-50 years of age, and more dramatically after age 70. Because men do not go through a distinct male menopause period, some doctors refer to this as androgen (testosterone) deficiency in the aging male (ADAM). Men typically experience a decline in testosterone production due to aging, but it can also be related to some diseases like diabetes.",
        "Whether waning function of the testicles contributes to such symptoms as fatigue, weakness, depression, decreased sexual desire , or impotence remains uncertain. If testosterone levels are low, replacing that hormone may help relieve them. However, replacing male hormones can worsen prostate cancer and high cholesterol levels. Talk to your doctor to see if hormone treatment is right for you."
