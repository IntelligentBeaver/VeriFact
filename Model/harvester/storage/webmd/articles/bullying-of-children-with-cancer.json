        "Brain cancer has left Tayden Ybarra, 16, legally blind in her left eye, says her mother, Tammy Ybarra. “She doesn’t see side to side, up, down, only like a pinpoint in the front.”",
        "At school, bullies have called Tayden “cross-eyed,” “crazy,” and “retarded” and have pulled her glasses off her face, Tammy says. Tayden, who lives in Katy, Texas, was diagnosed with cancer 10 years ago. When she was younger, a girl mocked her for using a cane when she struggled to walk. Another girl bit her. And the bullying still happens.",
        "“I keep on getting bullied over and over again,” Tayden says. She’s targeted, she says, because “I’m different.”",
        "Children with cancer are more likely to be bullied than students in general, according to a 2019 study published in the Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Nursing .  It showed that overall, 1 in 4 students are bullied compared to 1 in 3 who have cancer.",
        "The latter might be an underestimate, says Rhonda Robert, PhD. She’s a clinical psychologist and section chief for behavioral pediatrics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.",
        "“I would say they’re twice as likely to be bullied,” Robert says, noting that the same is true for other children with chronic health conditions."
