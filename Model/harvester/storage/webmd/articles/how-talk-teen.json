They stress over academic pressures and battle gnawing fears about their future. They worry a good work ethic is simply not enough to combat rising competition for college. And they openly complain how few adults listen to them.",

Yet he observes how many parents are either \"too apprehensive to talk\" about sex or perhaps haven't broached the subject since early puberty, figuring they'd covered the basics once, so why do it again? \"How do kids learn about sex and pregnancy , then?\" Kuczynski asks. \"From their peers, that's how.\" And while some kids learn from others' mistakes, just as many are influenced by their peers' riskier decisions."
