        "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can be thought of as chronic symptoms of heartburn . The term refers to the frequent backing up (reflux) of stomach contents (food, acid) into the esophagus -- the tube that connects the throat to the stomach . GERD also refers to the array of medical complications, some serious, that can arise from this reflux.",
        "Though it causes discomfort, occasional heartburn is not harmful. About 20% of adults in the U.S. experience symptoms such as heartburn and acid regurgitation at least once a week. But if you have heartburn frequently and it is untreated, your stomach's acid may inflame the lining of your esophagus or swallowing tube, potentially narrowing it.",
        "Stomach acid may also change the cells of the lining of your esophagus. This change, called Barrett's esophagus , increases the likelihood of certain cancers of the esophagus. Only a small percentage of people with GERD develop Barrett's esophagus.",
        "Your stomach's contents can also move into your throat, irritating your throat or vocal cords and causing hoarseness and a chronic, dry cough.",
        "Anyone can develop GERD at any age but you are more likely to develop it as you get older. Pregnant women are especially prone to reflux."
