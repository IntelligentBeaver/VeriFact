        "Community, empowerment, fun, and relaxation – these are a few words that come to mind when I think about my experience at the Young Survival Coalition (YSC)’s annual Wellness Summit, which was held in Bonita Springs, FL, this September. For those unfamiliar with the event, it’s a weekend dedicated to enhancing your relationship with your body, mind, and spirit, while connecting with other survivors, thrivers, and co-survivors.",
        "Even though I was working and not just attending the event, I still gained so much from the weekend. Some of the highlights for me included connecting with other survivors, doing the “wobble” during a MixxedFit class, cheering on all the cyclists and walkers, and getting my first massage ever. I left the weekend feeling inspired to reflect on different aspects of my wellness journey, particularly my gut, physical, and mental health – hence the motivation behind this blog post!",

        "I started taking my gut health seriously last year. Before then, I experienced horrible stomach aches and inflammation in my wrists and ankles after eating certain meals. I knew something was wrong, but I hadn’t taken the time to figure out what it was. Who knew that cutting dairy products out of my life would make me feel like a whole new person? I also try to incorporate more anti-inflammatory meals into my diet and only drink water regularly now. All of these small changes have made a big impact on my body, helping to clear up my skin and improve my energy levels."

        "Since I work remotely now, I often find myself sitting for long periods. I’ve made it a habit to walk for at least 30 minutes after work each day, which I’ve found to be a great way to connect with nature, clear my mind, and keep my body moving. I’ve also challenged myself to do more hiking, which I have a love-hate relationship with. This rocky relationship began during a study abroad trip to South Africa in college. The mountains there are breathtaking, but boy, are they tough to climb! My friends and I decided to hike Table Mountain one day, but we were very unprepared both physically and mentally. Since then, I’ve learned more about hiking preparedness and have conquered several hikes, including Camelback Mountain in Arizona and Arenal Volcano in Costa Rica most recently."
