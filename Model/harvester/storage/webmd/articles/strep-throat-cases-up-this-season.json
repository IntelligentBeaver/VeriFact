        "April 20, 2023 – Cases of strep throat surged this past winter, breaking a pre-pandemic trend that had been predictable since 2017, a new report says.",
        "Overall, strep throat cases were up 30%, compared to the previous peak from 6 years ago, according to an analysis by Epic Research. The research firm analyzed health records, which showed that strep throat was diagnosed in one in every 100 doctor’s office or emergency room visits in February of this year.",
        "As with many illnesses, strep had declined during the pandemic. Its strong return this season prompted the CDC to issue an alert to public health officials in December.",
        "The increase was seen in all age groups, but was particularly notable among 4- to 13-year-olds, according to Epic Research. That age group was diagnosed with strep in more than 5 in 10 medical visits in February.",
        "\"We have seen really an unprecedented rise in group A strep – more than we’ve probably seen here, looking back, at least for a decade, and probably longer than that,\" Sam Dominguez, MD, PhD, an infectious disease specialist at Children’s Hospital Colorado, told NBC News ."
