        "VMAT2 inhibitors are medications that treat movement disorders. The FDA has approved two VMAT2 inhibitors for treating tardive dyskinesia (TD) symptoms. These medications may be a good option for you if you have TD that’s affecting your quality of life. Because TD mainly happens as a side effect of certain medications – usually antipsychotic medications – doctors often recommend tapering or changing the medication or dose to the lowest effective dose to resolve TD. Sometimes weaning off or decreasing the medication doesn’t reduce TD symptoms. Sometimes coming off antipsychotic medications causes or worsens TD. And for some people, treating their underlying disorder is important enough that going off their medication for it isn’t an option. If you’re on a first-generation antipsychotic medication (chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, thioridazine, or trifluoperazine) your doctor may suggest switching to a newer, second-generation option to see if this reduces your TD symptoms. These options have a lower risk of causing TD. VMAT2 inhibitors are an option for persistent TD when changes in medications or dose aren’t sufficient."

        "In 2017, the FDA approved two VMAT2 inhibitors for TD, deutetrabenazine (Austedo) and valbenazine (Ingrezza). Researchers developed these two drugs in an attempt to find a treatment that could work as well on TD as an older VMAT2 inhibitor, tetrabenazine (Xenazine) while reducing the number of side effects. Both Austedo and Ingrezza turned out to be safer drugs with the same effectiveness on symptoms. Doctors used to prescribe tetrabenazine off-label for TD, but it is FDA approved only for the treatment of the abnormal movements seen in Huntington’s disease and causes more serious side effects. Deutetrabenazine (Austedo, Austedo XR) reduces involuntary movements caused by TD. The FDA also approved it for treating involuntary movements or chorea seen in Huntington’s disease. The extended-release tablet can be taken once a day, or your doctor may prescribe a twice-a-day tablet. Valbenazine (Ingrezza) helps reduce the involuntary movements that result from TD. It's also approved for treating involuntary movements or chorea seen in Huntington’s disease. You take it in capsule form once a day or you can sprinkle it on soft foods once a day."

        "VMAT2 stands for vesicular monoamine transporter type 2. VMAT2 is a protein that is responsible for taking dopamine molecules inside brain cells and putting them into a protective package called a vesicle. The vesicle helps dopamine travel safely through the gap between one nerve cell and another. Without the vesicle packaging, dopamine breaks down before it gets to the next cell. One of the roles dopamine plays in your body is to regulate movement. Typically, VMAT regulates how much dopamine goes from cell to cell. VMAT2 inhibitors are dopamine-depleting drugs. They stop VMAT proteins from putting dopamine into vesicles and reduce the amount of dopamine action from cell to cell."
