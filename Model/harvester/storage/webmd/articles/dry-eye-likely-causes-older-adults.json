        "It's common to feel some dryness and irritation in your eyes, especially when you spend a lot of time staring at a computer or other screen. But as you get older, you might notice that your eyes feel dry a lot of the time. That's because dry eye becomes more common as you age. As the years pass, your body makes fewer of the tears that used to keep your eyes moist. Medical conditions and medications you take could make the tears you do have evaporate faster than usual. With dry eye, you'll notice symptoms like: Stinging and burning A scratchy feeling like something is in your eyes Red and irritated eyes Pain when you wear contact lenses Blurry vision Sensitivity to light Dry eyes are also more watery. That might sound strange, but the irritation from dry eye actually makes your eyes produce more tears."

        "Women and people who were assigned female at birth (AFAB) are especially likely to get dry eye as they age because of hormonal changes that happen during menopause . When you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks your own tissues. That attack creates inflammation that damages various parts of your body. In your eyes, inflammation destroys the goblet cells that produce mucus. The autoimmune diseases that are most likely to cause dry eye are: Rheumatoid arthritis. This inflammatory form of arthritis is best known for causing joint damage. The same autoantibodies that attack the joints also affect the eyes. If you don't treat dry eye from rheumatoid arthritis , it could eventually lead to an infection or damage your cornea. Sarcoidosis. In this condition, the immune system makes too many inflammatory cells called granulomas. Those cells collect and form clumps in your lungs, lymph nodes , heart, and other parts of your body. Granulomas can also affect your eyes. Sarcoidosis inflames the lacrimal glands and reduces their ability to produce aqueous fluid. Sjӧgren's syndrome. If you have this condition, your immune system attacks the mucus-releasing glands that keep your mouth, eyes, and other parts of your body moist. Sjӧgren's syndrome causes symptoms like dry mouth and dry eyes. People with lupus and scleroderma sometimes have Sjӧgren's syndrome too, which increases their risk for dry eye."

Diabetes also affects the eyes. Dry eye is one of the most common diabetes-related eye problems, affecting more than half of people with the condition. Diabetes causes dry eye in a few ways. Consistently high blood sugar damages nerves in the lacrimal gland, which helps you make tears. Elevated blood sugar produces more inflammation, which also damages the lacrimal gland. Finally, your lacrimal gland needs insulin — the hormone that moves sugar from your bloodstream into your cells — to work properly. If your pancreas doesn't make enough insulin, dry eye can result.

You need vitamin A for clear night vision and to keep your eyes hydrated. You can become deficient in this vitamin if you don't eat enough carrots and other foods containing this vitamin, or if your body doesn't use vitamin A effectively. Medications The older you get, the more medical conditions you develop and the more medicines you need to manage them. More than half of adults age 65 and older take four or more prescription drugs. Your body removes medications more slowly with age, increasing the risk for side effects like dry eye.",

These tear-shaped glands sit above each eye and release the liquid layer of tears that keeps your eyes lubricated. The lacrimal glands need hormones called androgens to work properly.
