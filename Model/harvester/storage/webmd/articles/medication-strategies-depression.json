        "If you have treatment-resistant depression, you've already tried taking antidepressants without much success. But you shouldn't give up. It can take time to find the medication, dose, or mix of medicines that work for you. \"There are more than two dozen safe and effective antidepressants,\" says Jonathan E. Alpert, MD, PhD, chair of the American Psychiatric Association's Council on Research and a professor of psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center. The problem is that doctors can't predict exactly how people will respond to each medication. \"Many different factors contribute to depression, such as genetics and life's stressors,\" says psychiatrist Walter Dunn, MD, PhD, a health sciences assistant clinical professor at UCLA Health. Until there's a better understanding of the disease, finding the right treatment is done by trial and error."

Three in four people don't take their medications the way their doctor recommends. Some skip a day occasionally or stop taking a drug when they start feeling better. But these moves can keep an antidepressant from working well, says James W. Murrough, MD, PhD, director of the Depression and Anxiety Center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

        "Antidepressants usually don't start working right away. In general, it takes 6 to 8 weeks for them to reach their maximum effect, Murrough says. For some people, the process may take even longer. Your body also needs to adjust to the medication. When you take a new antidepressant, you may have side effects, such as a dry mouth, headache, fatigue, or an upset stomach. But these symptoms often go away after a few weeks. Change the dose of your medicine. People respond to antidepressants differently. You may need more or less of a drug than the standard amount. If you don't feel different after 2 to 4 weeks, your doctor may increase your dose, Alpert says."

        "Most antidepressants affect chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Each type of antidepressant acts on these chemicals in a different way: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These are often the first antidepressant prescribed, because they're less likely to cause side effects. They include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft). Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq), duloxetine (Cymbalta), levomilnacipran (Fetzima), and venlafaxine (Effexor XR) are examples of SNRIs. Atypical antidepressants. These drugs don't fall into the other main categories. Examples include bupropion (Wellbutrin SR), mirtazapine (Remeron), and vortioxetine (Trintellix). Tricyclic antidepressants. An older class, these antidepressants cause more side effects. They include amitriptyline, and doxepin, mipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor). Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  If you take these drugs, such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), and tranylcypromine (Parnate), you'll need to be on a strict diet because they can cause dangerous interactions. Your doctor may want to try a medicine from the same or a different class. \"The research shows that if you don't respond to one SSRI, another one may work,\" Dunn says."
