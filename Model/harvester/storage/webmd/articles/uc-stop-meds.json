        "Taking medicine is a big part of your ulcerative colitis (UC) treatment plan. But many people wind up stopping or skipping doses: Research shows that 1 in 5 people with an inflammatory bowel disease , such as UC, don’t take their meds as prescribed.",
        "There are many reasons why people are tempted to quit, says Aline Charabaty, MD, director of the IBD Center at Johns Hopkins-Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, DC. Taking medicine can be a hassle, or you don’t like the side effects. Or you’re in remission and feeling fine, so you think you don’t need meds anymore.",
        "But it’s important to stick with the game plan. Drugs keep the inflammation in your colon and rectum in check. This gives it time to heal. “When you stop medication, there’s a high chance that you’ll relapse,” Charabaty says. The inflammation can set off a flare-up of symptoms. What’s worse, it can lead to permanent damage or other complications."
