        "Anyone can get psoriasis, but people of color are more often undertreated for the chronic autoimmune disorder, with its inflammation and scaly, itchy, or burning patches of skin. This may be because psoriasis happens more often in White people and is easier to see on fair skin. It can look different on other skin tones. People of color may find themselves in a rut of topical therapies that don’t effectively treat their psoriasis, or they may not be treated at all. “In general, Black patients are more likely to present with more advanced disease,” says Ginette Okoye, MD, a professor and chair of dermatology at Howard University College of Medicine. “One, because of access to dermatologists, but also because sometimes it’s just harder to diagnose, and it could have been misdiagnosed.” Although Okoye treats a lot of people of color with psoriasis, “I still can’t always pin it down,” she says."

But, people of color – and particularly Black people – may have scaling that’s considerably thicker. The plaques can take longer to heal and require stronger medicines to treat.

People of color may also be left with hypopigmentation, or light spots, on their skin. Depending on where they are on the skin, these dark and light patches may take as long as a year to clear. For some, these post-inflammatory changes in pigmentation can be more of a worry than the psoriasis itself.

        "“At this point, the best treatments we have are biologics that actually change the immune system on a molecular level,” Akintilo says. But one study found that Black Medicare patients were 70% less likely to be treated with biologics than White people with the same insurance, economic status, and seriousness of disease. Black people were less familiar with biologic medicines for psoriasis, another study found, no matter their income or education. Research shows that early and effective treatment of psoriasis may lower your chances of getting psoriatic arthritis (PsA), a complication that about a third of psoriasis patients get. Akintilo believes biologics are a good first-line treatment if psoriasis plaques cover a large area of your body or affect your daily activities and quality of life, since it’s not practical to put topicals everywhere. For some, getting biologics prescriptions filled can be difficult, Okoye says. “Depending on the type of insurance they have, and their insurance company’s preference for biologics, the process can be quite time-consuming, lengthy, and confusing for patients. It sometimes takes us weeks, sometimes a month, to get the medicine into their hands.”"

        "Phototherapy, which uses ultraviolet light, is a useful treatment for psoriasis. Phototherapy may cause increased pigmentation, or tanning , on darker skin. A higher dose of phototherapy may be needed, which many doctors may not feel comfortable providing. Still, it’s considered safe and effective for skin of color. Akintilo recommends it, saying, “There’s testing done at the initiation period where we make sure we start at the right dose so patients don't get any burns of the skin. And then it's kind of a tightly regimented protocol for adjusting the duration of treatment, but it's a great treatment option for a lot of patients.” Also, patients with darker-toned skin “have an advantage with phototherapy because they are less likely to get a sunburn from the procedure,” Okoye says. “The melanin in the skin is protective. It’s almost like your own natural SPF, which is why we need higher doses of phototherapy.”"

Yes, they’re walking and talking and sometimes leading normal lives, but they are at a very high risk for cardiovascular disease . They are more likely to have diabetes and high blood pressure. Psoriasis affects your quality of life and your sense of self. They can’t sleep because sometimes they’re really itchy. It’s a really impactful disease.” The longer you wait to see a doctor, or the longer your diagnosis is delayed, the more psoriasis may impact your life. Don’t let the lack of people of color featured in advertisements about psoriasis treatments keep you from getting more guidance about your condition. Psoriasis can affect anyone, regardless of race or ethnicity. Resources such as the National Psoriasis Foundation’s Skin of Color Resource Center and the Skin of Color Society provide information to patients and doctors about special considerations when treating psoriasis in skin of color. Remember, getting an early handle on managing your psoriasis can help ease your symptoms and prevent complications. You don’t have to have a dermatologist who’s a person of color, but it does help to find one who has cultural competency. That’s the ability to see the social, cultural, and community influences on health care actions and include that information when planning patient care. The doctor should also have an understanding of how to treat all types of skin. Tell your health care provider your concerns, Akintilo says. “Report your symptoms or say if it’s affecting your quality of life.”"
