Fortunately, peripheral arthritis usually doesn’t cause any lasting damage to your joints. Treating your UC usually improves your joint issues as well.",

Sometimes people have these joint symptoms months or even years before gut symptoms appear, especially if you’re young. Axial arthritis may cause lasting damage if the bones of the spine fuse together. That means you’ll have less range of motion in your back.",
