        "When you have acute hepatic porphyria (AHP), getting on the right treatment is important. AHP is a serious condition that causes attacks of belly pain and other symptoms. Some people have frequent, severe attacks. Others have only a few attacks. AHP isn't curable, except for with a liver transplant in severe cases. But it is treatable with medicine and lifestyle changes. Getting diagnosed and started on treatment quickly, plus avoiding your triggers, can stop these attacks and help prevent serious complications like high blood pressure, paralysis, and kidney failure."

The second part is to take medicines that reduce the number of attacks you get, and manage your symptoms when you do have an attack. AHP has four types: Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ALAD) Variegate porphyria (VP) Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) The AHP treatment your doctor prescribes will depend on which type you have and how severe it is. During attacks you'll probably need treatment in a hospital to manage your pain as well as symptoms like high blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, and electrolyte imbalances."

        "Gene changes cause AHP, but certain environmental factors set off bouts of symptoms. You can prevent attacks or reduce the number of attacks you get by avoiding your triggers. Don't take medicines that can cause AHP symptoms. These include carbamazepine (Tegretol), phenobarbital , phenytoin (Dilantin), and sulfonamide antibiotics. Your doctor can give you the complete list of possible triggers so you can avoid them. Practice healthy habits. Drink alcohol not at all or only in moderation (no more than one drink a day for women and two a day for men). Don't use recreational drugs like marijuana. If you smoke tobacco products, use cessation techniques like nicotine replacement to help you quit. Eat a balanced diet. Avoid extreme or fad eating plans that require you to dramatically cut calories or carbohydrates. Stay up-to-date on your vaccinations. Ask your doctor which vaccines you need. If you do get an infection, treat it promptly. Manage stress. Find a relaxation method that calms your mind and body. Use sun protection. Some types of AHP make your skin extra sensitive to the sun. Try to stay inside during the hours when ultraviolet rays are strongest, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. When you do have to be outside, wear sun-protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30."

You may need treatment in a hospital for serious AHP symptoms like seizures, trouble breathing, severe pain, and hallucinations. Intravenous (IV) hemin (Panhematin). When you have AHP, you're missing an enzyme your body needs to make heme. Heme is a part of hemoglobin, a protein that carries oxygen in your blood. Alpha-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) are other substances that go into making heme. Doctors call them porphyrin precursors. ALA and PBG are toxic to your body. When you can't make heme, these substances build up in your liver and cause symptoms. Hemin is a salt that comes from red blood cells. It stops ALA and PBG production and brings levels of these substances back to normal. Hemin can also improve AHP symptoms and prevent complications. For a severe attack, you'll go to a hospital and get this treatment through an IV once a day for 4 days."

Having AHP puts you at higher risk for a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma. If you're 50 or older, get screened for this cancer each year with ultrasound and a blood test for the alpha fetoprotein (AFP) tumor marker. AHP also increases your risk for kidney damage. Your doctor will check your kidney function regularly. GnRH agonists increase the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Women who take these medicines will need regular monitoring of their blood sugar, blood pressure, and heart health. Anyone who is on preventive hemin needs to be tested for ferritin, a protein in the blood that contains iron. Taking hemin long term can lead to iron overload."
