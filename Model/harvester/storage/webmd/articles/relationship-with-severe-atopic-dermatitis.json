        "Atopic dermatitis (AD) doesn’t have a cure, so when you have it, you have it for life. Many people who live with the condition deal with low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and stress because of its symptoms. “Atopic dermatitis, or eczema , is a common enough condition that many times people say ‘Oh, it’s just eczema,’” says William F. Smith, MD, dermatologist at Louisville Dermatology Institute in Shelbyville, KY. “But it’s not ‘just’ eczema, it can really take its toll on people who live with it.” The best management for AD includes treatment from a dermatologist, but there are ways that you on your own can improve your quality of life, mindset, and relationship with your skin as you navigate life with this chronic skin condition."
