        "An ocular migraine (also called a retinal migraine) is a rare type of migraine headache that causes visual symptoms in one of your eyes. The problem isn't with your eyes; it's a problem with the way your brain is processing visual signals from your eyes. You may be able to tell if you close your eyes. If you still have symptoms with your eyes closed, then the problem is likely coming from your brain, not your eyes.",
