        "Feb. 19, 2025 – A vaccine for pregnant women that protects babies from respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) appears safe, according to two new studies that give researchers hope for widespread immunity against the disease, the leading cause of infant hospitalization in the United States.",
        "Women given the RSV vaccine between weeks 32 and 36 of pregnancy showed no link between the vaccine and preterm birth, a concern raised by earlier trials .",
