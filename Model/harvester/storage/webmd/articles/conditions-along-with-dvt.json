        "If you’ve been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), you might be wondering if you’re at a higher risk for other health problems, too. DVT is when a blood clot forms in a vein deep in your body (usually in your leg). Sometimes clots form in veins for no apparent reason. But many conditions increase your odds of developing DVT. You might have had these problems before you developed DVT. In some cases, you might not be diagnosed with them until after you get DVT. Here’s what you need to know."
