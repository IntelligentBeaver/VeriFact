        "Hormonal changes during your menstrual cycle can be linked to an increased risk for depression. That includes the hormone fluctuations of perimenopause, menopause, and postmenopause. But it's hard to know the exact cause of that depression. That's because many women in these groups also face the stress of balancing work and home responsibilities, single parenthood, and caring for children and aging parents.",
