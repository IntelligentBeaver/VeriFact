        "Oct. 3, 2024 -- Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is often thought of as a childhood illness, but it poses a significant threat to older adults as well. According to the CDC, RSV infected approximately 65 million people globally last year, leading to an estimated 160,000 hospitalizations among adults aged 60 and older. What does RSV look like in adults , and what symptoms should you be vigilant about? In this episode, we are joined by Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett-Helaire , a renowned vaccinologist and assistant professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who breaks down the risks, ongoing vaccine development, and prevention strategies for vulnerable populations, particularly older adults. We also hear from Irene, who, at 69-years of age, experienced severe, unfamiliar, cold-like symptoms that ultimately led to an unexpected RSV diagnosis.",

  "meta_description": "Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is often thought of as a childhood illness, but it poses a significant threat to older adults as well. According to the CDC, RSV infected approximately 65 million people globally last year, leading to an estimated 160,000 hospitalizations among adults aged 60 and older. What does RSV look like in adults, and what symptoms should you be vigilant about? In this episode, we are joined by Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett-Helaire, a renowned vaccinologist and assistant professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who breaks down the risks, ongoing vaccine development, and prevention strategies for vulnerable populations, particularly older adults. We also hear from Irene, who, at 69-years of age, experienced severe, unfamiliar, cold-like symptoms that ultimately led to an unexpected RSV diagnosis.",
