        "Puberty usually starts when kids are between ages 8 and 14. Children with central precocious puberty (CPP) start the process earlier than their peers -- before age 8 in girls, and by age 9 in boys. In boys, the penis grows and the voice deepens. Girls develop breasts and begin to get their period. Being the first of their friends to enter puberty can cause stress and anxiety. As a result, some kids have problems with their emotions and behavior. Precocious puberty also affects a child's growth. At first, children grow faster than their peers. But because their bones stop growing sooner than normal, they may end up shorter than they should've been. Central precocious puberty doesn't always need treatment. Kids who start puberty close to the normal age (7 or 8) may be able to wait, especially if their puberty is moving slowly. They'll have check-ups every few months so that their doctor can see how puberty is progressing. Younger children can take medicine to slow or stop puberty and keep them on pace with their friends. Sometimes early puberty can be reversed. CPP treatments also help kids grow taller."

        "When it's time to start puberty, a child's brain releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This signals their pituitary gland to release two other hormones -- luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH and FSH signal a boy's testes to make the hormone testosterone, and a girl's ovaries to make estrogen. These sex hormones cause the changes of puberty -- body hair, acne, growth, menstrual periods in girls, and a deeper voice in boys. In children with CPP, these hormones show up too early. One group of medicines that treat central precocious puberty are GnRH agonists. They stop the pituitary gland from making FSH and LH. Blocking these hormones prevents the release of testosterone and estrogen, which slows or stops puberty. Examples of GnRH agonists are: Leuprolide acetate (Lupron Depot) Triptorelin (Trelstar, Triptodur) These medicines come as a shot that children get about once a month. Histrelin (Supprelin LA, Vantas) is another hormone treatment. It comes as an implant that the doctor places under the skin of your child's arm with a minor surgery. Each implant slowly releases the medicine into your child's body for a year. At the end of the year, the doctor replaces the old implant with a new one. They'll check your child every few months to make sure the treatment is working and that their puberty has slowed or stopped. Kids can stop taking these medicines once they reach the age when puberty is supposed to start."
