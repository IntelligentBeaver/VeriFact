Then you can drown the pests in a bowl of hot, soapy water. 2. Follow instructions. Don’t use dog products on a cat, as this could be deadly. Only apply the amount needed for your pet's size. Never double up on products. There’s no need to pair a powder with a spot-on treatment. 3. Wear gloves, or wash your hands with soap and water after you apply the drug.
