        "Kyra Sedgwick has to jump on another phone. It's her husband calling. She and actor Kevin Bacon will celebrate their 24th wedding anniversary this September, and there's a melty tenderness in her voice when she says, \"Hi, honey … is everything OK?\" There's a pause, and you can hear the smile -- that screen-illuminating Sedgwick smile -- in her voice as she says, \"OK, I love you, bye.\"",
        "Right there is a clue as to just why Sedgwick and Bacon are one of Hollywood's admired veteran couples. Though they married young and, some might say, hastily -- she was just 22 when they met on the set of the PBS adaptation of the play Lemon Sky ; they married within less than a year and conceived their son on their honeymoon -- they are still going strong nearly a quarter-century later.",
        "\"We don't take each other for granted,\" says Sedgwick, who will be 47 in August. As most two-career couples with kids can attest, that's an easy trap to fall into. \"So many other things seem to be much more urgent. You're feeling comfortable and safe in your marriage, and you think you can put it on the back burner and go, well, that's OK, because this other thing is much more urgent: kids, work, Hollywood, whatever."
