        "Like most people who have been relatively healthy all their lives, I never expected to end up with a chronic medical condition. But about 5 years ago my health took a definite downturn as I developed nonspecific symptoms -- physical exhaustion, insomnia, muscle weakness, and many others -- that defied any clear medical explanation. I was forced to drastically reduce my work hours and give up most of my social life. At home I struggled to be the dad and partner I wanted to be, as I couldn’t even keep up with my wife and young kids on our family walks.",
        "It’s not easy to adjust to our health challenges, including the emotional struggles. We might feel depressed about our loss of function, terrified that we’ll slip further into disability, envious of those who are healthy and strong, ashamed of our limitations, and angry that we can’t find a solution. These feelings are normal and understandable as we face a new reality and an uncertain future."

The struggles I’ve had in coping with my illness are similar to those I’ve witnessed in loved ones and patients who experienced long-term health problems. For many of us, the hardest part of adapting to an illness is the loss of identity. It can be hard to recognize the person you’ve become due to a longstanding illness. I wasn’t used to having my weaknesses and limitations be so apparent. I used to be full of energy, but I now need a nap every day, struggle at times to walk up one flight of stairs, and often have to turn down invitations from friends and family.

If we’ve been a lifelong runner, we might try to keep up with our same regimen even if it’s too exhausting for us; or, we might decide we won’t exercise at all if we can’t do our normal routine.",

Perhaps we can no longer walk in the heat of the day, but the cool of the morning is still available to us. As much as you can, find ways to do the things that bring you joy by making any necessary accommodations.
