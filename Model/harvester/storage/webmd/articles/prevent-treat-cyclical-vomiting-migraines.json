Cyclical vomiting syndrome can happen more than one week apart but are regularly at the same time of the day, week, or month.",

        "Cyclical vomiting syndrome is also known as abdominal migraines . This is because you have a lot of recurring abdominal pain. The same common causes for migraines have been linked to abdominal migraines too."
