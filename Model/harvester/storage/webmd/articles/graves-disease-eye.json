        "When you have thyroid eye disease, a problem with your immune system causes it to attack the muscles and fat around your eyes. This can lead to symptoms like pain, a gritty feeling in your eyes, and double vision.",
        "Thyroid eye disease has two phases. During the active phase, it causes inflammation , swelling, and other symptoms. This phase lasts 2 months to 2 years.",

        "Thyroid eye disease can sometimes change your appearance or affect your sight. Permanent vision loss can happen, but it is rare, and treatments can ease swelling and other symptoms."
