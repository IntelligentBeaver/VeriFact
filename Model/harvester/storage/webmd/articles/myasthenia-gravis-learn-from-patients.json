        "Myasthenia gravis comes with a lot of frustrations for patients, from diagnosis through  treatment of the condition and management of their symptoms. For some patients, just getting a diagnosis can be very frustrating. They may have what we call seronegative myasthenia gravis, which means they don’t have the antibodies that people commonly have in this disease. That makes it very hard to get a diagnosis. For these patients, just getting to an answer can be an odyssey. Once you have the diagnosis, there’s enormous uncertainty. Most people don’t know what the disease is. Few know anyone who has it. Unfortunately, the information that people get about the disease at first is not always from a doctor but from the internet. While there are a lot of great, well-researched, and respectable sources of information online, some are not. This means that many newly diagnosed patients, before sitting down with me, may have a lot of inaccurate information."

For some patients, the first set of medications we try works very well. But sometimes we have to try multiple different kinds of combinations of medications before we find the ones that work. Some patients have other medical conditions that keep us from using some treatments. Diabetes, for example, limits our ability to use prednisone.
