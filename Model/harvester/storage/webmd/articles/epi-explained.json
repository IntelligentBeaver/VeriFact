        "You may know this about the relationship between the pancreas and diabetes : The pancreas makes insulin, the hormone that helps your body control its glucose levels. But this organ does more than that. In addition to creating insulin, “the second important role for the pancreas has to do with digestion ,” explains Darshan Kothari, MD, a gastroenterologist at Duke Health in Raleigh, North Carolina. “The pancreas assists digestion by secreting enzymes or chemicals that help you digest food.” What is EPI? Exocrine glands make substances that are released through tubes or ducts in your body, such as sweat, saliva, and tears, as well as the enzymes from your pancreas that help you digest your food. So, if you’ve been diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), your pancreas isn’t producing enough of these enzymes, and you can’t digest your food properly. “It’s a relatively rare disorder,” Kothari says. “Over the last several years, there has been an increasing incidence of the disease. People are more inclined to test for, and therefore, diagnose and treat it. So, the incidence is rising, but it’s probably more likely diagnosis of people who have been living with vague symptoms for years.”"

        "Most often, EPI is caused by damage to the pancreas or by pancreatic disease. “Pancreatic insufficiency generally presents in one of two ways,\" Kothari says. \"The first way is patients who have known pancreatic disease, meaning that they’ve had a history of pancreatitis or a family history of pancreatitis, or [they] have a personal history or diagnosis of pancreatic cancer .” Other patients don’t have any diagnosis, but have EPI symptoms. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 30%-90% of people with chronic pancreatitis and 80%-90% of people with cystic fibrosis have problems with producing pancreatic enzymes. Chronic pancreatitis happens when your pancreas has been inflamed for a long time. This can damage the organ and its ability to produce enzymes. Heavy alcohol use and smoking can cause chronic pancreatitis, but some types of it also run in families."

        "Surgery might be an option to help manage EPI, but it’s not a cure, and it’s not for everyone. “Surgery really is designed for two reasons,” Kothari says. “It’s either to remove [cancerous] tissue or [precancerous] tissue or to help promote adequate drainage of the pancreas.” The surgery can open ducts that are clogged or blocked by gallstones, and decompression can widen a main pancreatic duct that’s too narrow. “If you imagine that the pancreas looks like an ear of corn lying on its side in the middle of your abdomen, each of those kernels are sacks of enzymes,” Kothari says. “Each kernel is producing an enzyme and drains it into the middle stalk, and that stalk then connects to the small intestines. Sometimes, when you have pancreatitis, there can be inflammation that causes scarring of the stalk, and as a result, those enzymes are not able to get to the small intestines.” Another option is to remove your pancreas and give you an autologous islet cell transplant. These are cells from your own body that make insulin. The doctor will get them into your body through a vein in your liver."
