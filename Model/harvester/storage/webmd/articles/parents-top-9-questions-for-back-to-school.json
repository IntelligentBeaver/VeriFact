        "The back-to-school season can arouse dread in parents and kids alike, especially when it comes to sickness and health. Aside from marking the end of summer's lazy days, \"back to school\" signals the start of a crazy time for many families, a time during which we scramble to update immunizations, re-establish more structured eating, television, and bedtime routines, and keep our kids healthy.",
        "To help you plan a healthy and anxiety-free school year, we spoke with Jean Grabeel, a registered and certified school nurse who coordinates health services for 24,000 students at the Springfield public school district in southwest Missouri. She answers nine questions on the minds of parents readying themselves for a new school year -- and a new cold and flu season.",
        "1. How do I decrease my child's anxiety about starting school?",
        "For a happier, healthier transition, don't wait until the night before school starts to set up sleep and nutrition routines that might not have been strictly enforced over the summer. Try setting bed and wake-up times a few weeks before school starts and gradually adjusting them to be earlier as the first day approaches."
