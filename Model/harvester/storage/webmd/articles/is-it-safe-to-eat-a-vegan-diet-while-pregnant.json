Eating a variety of plants and avoiding high levels of saturated fat and cholesterol — both of which are found in many animal products — can be good for you. But is it good if you're pregnant?",

A review of the medical records of 775 health-conscious vegan mothers who received good prenatal care and supplemented their diets with vitamins found that only one developed preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is often associated with rapid weight gain and eating foods high in saturated fat. A healthy vegan diet may protect against developing preeclampsia.",

Vegan diets that are high in fiber — including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains — and low in saturated fat may reduce the risk of excessive weight gain and gestational diabetes. If you have gestational diabetes, a vegan diet may reduce your chances of having a C-section. It may also reduce your need for insulin.",

Neural tube defects, which are birth defects of the brain, spine, or spinal cord, have been associated with a high nitrate intake during pregnancy. Since cured meat and smoked fish are the main sources of nitrates in most diets, vegan diets reduce this risk."
