        "How many PVCs are normal in 24 hours ?",
        "There's a wide normal range. In a study of healthy young adults, half were found to have more than two PVCs a day, but 5% had more than 193 a day. Another study of older adults found almost all had at least one PVC a day, and that the typical rate was about two per hour. In general, PVCs increase with age and are more common in men than in women. Many people don't even notice them.",
        "When PVCs happen much more often than usual, they can reduce the pumping power of the heart, leading to a condition called cardiomyopathy . There's no clear-cut number of PVCs that leads to that kind of damage. But some researchers put the high-risk range at 10,000 to 20,000 extra beats each day. Keep in mind that your heart normally beats about 100,000 times a day."
