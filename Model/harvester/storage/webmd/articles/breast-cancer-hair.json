        "“As soon as you're diagnosed, stop harsh styling practices,” says Jerilynn Stephens, a Los Angeles-based hair stylist. That includes bleaching, coloring, braids, and weaves, as well as using high-heat tools like blow-dryers, or curling or straightening irons,",
        "L.A. hair stylist Jerilynn Stephens has worked on the set of the TV show The Voice for most of its many seasons.",
        "Strong hair from the get-go has a better fighting chance when treatment begins, Stephens says. She’s not just speaking as a professional. She went through ovarian cancer chemo in 2021.",
        "Some people try cold caps, or scalp cooling, to try to prevent or reduce chemo-related hair loss. The idea is that the cold temperature restricts blood flow , which cuts down on how much chemo gets to the hair follicle. The FDA has approved some automated devices for this purpose. There are also frozen gel caps that cost less but  aren’t regulated by the FDA. These products may help some people, but not everyone – and you may still lose some hair, though less than without them. Talk with your doctor before you start scalp cooling."
