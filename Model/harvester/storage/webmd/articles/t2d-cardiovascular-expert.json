        "By Yu-Ming Ni, MD, as told to Stephanie Booth Thankfully, I feel that patients are better informed these days about the connection between diabetes and heart disease. My job is often to help them feel optimistic that controlling their diabetes can help to reduce their risk for future heart problems. Too often, I hear that patients feel fated to have a heart attack, when in reality up to 90% of your risk for a heart attack is modifiable. Even people who come from families where it seems like everyone has had a heart problem can regain control of their destiny and significantly reduce their risk for a heart problem themselves with consistent healthy lifestyle choices. Diabetes is a great example of a condition where lifestyle choices can significantly improve blood sugar control and prevent long-term complications."

They have to see a number of specialists related to their condition: diabetes specialists (endocrinologists), kidney specialists (nephrologists), foot specialists (podiatrists), nutritionists, and of course, me (cardiologists). But I think it underscores the importance of early detection and treatment of diabetes. The sooner you can start making healthy lifestyle changes to control your blood sugar, the less likely it is that you will develop complications and also less likely you will need all of these specialists. It is possible to reverse and cure diabetes with the right steps."

        "We know that people with diabetes and heart disease can have considerable mental health issues. We know that depression is more common with both conditions, and medications that are used for heart disease can sometimes worsen mental health issues. Also, there can be drug interactions between anxiety and depression medications and heart medications. By outlining the specific changes that people can make to their risk level, I try to inspire hope for a healthier future free of heart disease. Part of that is by offering behavior changes that they can easily make. This can be simply walking after dinner every night or cutting out a single unhealthy food type. Beyond that, I focus on the positive aspects of my patient’s health when I’m talking with them. I refer them to additional support, such as counseling, if their anxiety or depression is severe."
