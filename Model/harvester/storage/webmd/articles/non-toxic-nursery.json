        "Since crawling babies spend lots of time on the floor, avoid wall-to-wall carpeting, if possible. \"Any chemicals that you've brought into your home can get trapped in carpeting and released over time,\" says Zandonella. Instead, choose hardwood, or another sustainable wood like bamboo or cork on the floor. If you want something soft for the baby to crawl on, opt for a throw rug made with wool, cotton, or another natural material."
