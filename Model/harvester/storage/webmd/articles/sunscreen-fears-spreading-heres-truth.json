        "June 10, 2025 — Just as summer begins and people are stocking up on sunscreen, a new report is raising questions about the safety and effectiveness of many brands. But the truth behind those attention - grabbing headlines is more complicated.",
        "The research , conducted by a nonprofit advocacy group that verifies sunscreens with its own seal, looked at more than 2,200 sunscreens and found that just 498 met its high bar for safety and effectiveness. While the group, called the Environmental Working Group (EWG), raises valid concerns about certain chemical ingredients, which some studies link to health risks in mice, experts caution that the report leaves out key research findings. “They used a fraction of the literature out there to determine safety,” said Adam Friedman, MD a dermatologist at The George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences in Washington, D.C.",
        "Two JAMA studies cited by the report, for instance, found that various UV filters — the chemicals in sunscreens that absorb or block sunlight — could be detected in people’s blood after repeated application, but neither study showed effects on the body, Friedman said."
