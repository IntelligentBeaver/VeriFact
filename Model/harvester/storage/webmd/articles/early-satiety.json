        "There are several possible reasons why you might feel full sooner than normal. Early satiety can happen when your stomach empties too slowly, doesn’t stretch properly during meals, or becomes overly sensitive, says Michael Camilleri, MD, a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.",
        "Other factors outside of your stomach may also play a role. For example, constipation can cause a feeling of fullness, and certain eating disorders — including anorexia nervosa and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder ( ARFID ) — can disrupt normal hunger and fullness cues.",
        "A possible cause of early satiety is a condition called gastroparesis. When your stomach is working right, it contracts to crush food, which it then sends to your intestines. But with gastroparesis, your stomach can’t contract like it should, so food builds up there instead. Gastroparesis can be caused by diabetes, cancer, and other diseases, infections, and surgery, just to name a few."
