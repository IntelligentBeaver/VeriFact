        "Asparlas works by lowering levels of an amino acid called L-asparagine that cancer cells in ALL need to survive. Leukemia cells cannot make enough L-asparagine on their own and must get it from the blood.",
        "Asparlas contains an enzyme called L-asparaginase. L-asparaginase breaks down L-asparagine in the blood. If L-asparagine in the blood is broken down, it cannot be used by leukemia cells to make proteins they need to survive. Healthy cells are less affected by the lack of L-asparagine, because they can make their own L-asparagine.",
        "Asparlas is pegylated. This means that the medicine is attached to a compound called polyethylene glycol, or PEG. This helps the medicine stay in the body longer. For Asparlas, being pegylated allows the L-asparaginase enzyme to be given about once every 21 days."
