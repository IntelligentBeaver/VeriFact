        "Suggestions on ways to help kickstart labor have been available for a long time, and some have more scientific support than others. One common folk remedy is for pregnant women to eat pineapple. It’s thought to help kick contractions into gear and encourage the cervix to loosen. But there doesn't seem to be a lot of evidence to back it up.",
        "Occasional anecdotal evidence has linked eating large amounts of pineapple to getting labor started. Online message boards largely attribute this to the presence of the enzyme bromelain. But there’s not a lot of scientific support for it.",
        "Some studies have shown bromelain to cause uterine contractions in animals but only when applied directly to the uterus. Even in the animal studies, the bromelain simply caused contractions, but not labor. There was no sign that the bromelain applied in any way actually sped up the labor process. There have been no studies with pregnant people.",
        "If you’re 39, 40, or even 41 weeks pregnant, it may be tempting to try even unproven methods of inducing labor. But before you do, check with your doctor."
