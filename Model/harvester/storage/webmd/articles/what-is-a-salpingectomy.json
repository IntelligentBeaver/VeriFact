        "Salpingectomy (sal-pin-JEK-tuh-me) is the surgical removal of one or both fallopian tubes. After this procedure, getting pregnant is usually more difficult. There are several reasons to get a salpingectomy, such as preventing ovarian cancer, ectopic pregnancy, tubal blockage, or infection.",
        "There are several types of salpingectomy. You may have one or both fallopian tubes removed. Your doctor may recommend removing the entire fallopian tube or only part of it. There are also different surgical approaches: minimally invasive using very small incisions (cuts), or traditional, with a large incision. Your doctor will recommend the best method depending on your situation.",
        "Your fallopian tubes are located on either side of your uterus, at the top, and extend down to your ovaries. The fallopian tubes play an important role in conception. Women or people assigned female at birth (AFAB) ovulate during their menstrual cycle. Ovulation is when your ovary releases an egg for fertilization. The egg is then guided by tiny, finger-like structures through your fallopian tubes towards your uterus. As the egg travels through your fallopian tubes, it can be fertilized by sperm."
