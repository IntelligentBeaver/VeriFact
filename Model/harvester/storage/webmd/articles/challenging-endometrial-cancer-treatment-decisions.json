        "When doctors catch endometrial cancer at an early stage, it's often curable with surgery to remove the tumor. Once the cancer spreads outside the uterus, it becomes more challenging to treat – but not impossible. New treatments like immunotherapy and targeted therapy have led to a better outlook for people who are diagnosed with this cancer. \"We used to think that for patients who had stage IV disease, the overall survival at five years was less than 10%. That number has improved a great deal,\" says Leslie Boyd, MD, a gynecologic oncologist and director of the Division of Gynecologic Oncology at NYU Langone Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York City. Endometrial cancer treatment is personalized based on things like your health, where your cancer has spread, and the results of your molecular and genetic tests. Choosing the right treatment approach involves a collaboration between you, your oncologist, and other members of your medical team. Many therapies are available now for advanced endometrial cancer, and they can cause short-term and long-term side effects that you should know about. Because this can be an emotional and stressful time, it's important to openly communicate with your doctor and advocate for yourself to get the care you need."

And take time to enjoy and appreciate the people and special moments in your life."
