        "June 25, 2024 – Loneliness isn't just a state of mind – it could be a matter of life and death.",
        "At least that's according to groundbreaking research from Harvard. Their latest study dives deep into how feelings of isolation, often brushed off as a natural part of aging, could dramatically up the odds of having a devastating stroke among middle-age and older adults.",
        "“Loneliness is increasingly considered a major public health issue. Our findings further highlight why that is,” lead author Yenee Soh, ScD, of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in a statement . “Especially when experienced chronically, our study suggests loneliness may play an important role in stroke incidence, which is already one of the leading causes of long-term disability and mortality worldwide.”",
        "The researchers took a novel approach of examining the impact of chronic loneliness. Previous studies have linked loneliness during a single point in time to heart and brain health.",
        "More than one-third of adults age 45 or older report feeling lonely, according to a 2020 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Loneliness is defined as the feeling of being alone, regardless of social contact."
