        "May 29, 2025 — Planning a summer trip abroad? If you or your kids aren ’ t fully vaccinated against the measles, you risk bringing home more than souvenirs. While measles cases in the U.S. seem finally to be slowing down, experts warn that international travel could reignite outbreaks and push the country’s already high case numbers even higher.",
        "Since January, Texas has confirmed more than 700 measles cases , including 94 hospitalizations and two deaths. Across the country, outbreaks are also in 11 other states — in Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee — with well over a thousand cases total nationwide, making 2025 the second-worst measles year since the illness was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 .",
        "While experts can’t say for sure how these flare-ups started, many U.S. measles outbreaks trace back to international travel — when a partially vaccinated or unvaccinated person journeys to a country where the disease is still common, catches the virus, and returns home to a community with low vaccination rates."
