        "Sentinel lymph node mapping or lymphatic mapping is an important step in invasive breast cancer detection. It's used to identify whether breast cancer cells are spreading to your other body parts. Lymphatic mapping is followed by a sentinel lymph node biopsy for accurate diagnosis.",
        "Lymph nodes are small bean-shaped structures present throughout your body. They are connected through lymphatic vessels and are a part of the immune system that filters foreign particles like bacteria . Breast cancer cells can travel through the lymphatic vessels toward the lymph nodes in your underarm area.",
        "Lymphatic vessels from the breast connect to these lymph nodes and drain into one or more nodes before moving to others. The first node into which breast cancer cells spread or are drained into is called the sentinel or guarding lymph node.",
        "The sentinel lymph node can be identified by lymphatic mapping. A radioactive agent or isotope called technetium 99 and a blue dye called isosulfan blue are injected into the breast tissue close to the site of cancer. This helps identify the sentinel node or nodes into which breast cancer cells get drained. If cancer has not spread the dye won’t be present. But if it has spread, it will be detected in the sentinel node or nodes."
