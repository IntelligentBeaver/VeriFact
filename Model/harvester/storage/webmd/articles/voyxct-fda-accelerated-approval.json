        "Voyxact (sibeprenlimab-szsi) is a new medicine approved by the FDA to lower protein levels in urine for adults with a kidney condition called primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) who are at risk of their illness getting worse. IgAN is a long-lasting illness caused by the buildup of a type of antibody called IgA in the kidneys. This buildup causes inflammation and damage, leading to protein in the urine (proteinuria) and a gradual decline in kidney function. If left untreated, IgAN can lead to kidney failure.",
        "Voyxact is a lab-made monoclonal antibody that works by blocking a protein called A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). APRIL produces a harmful type of IgA called galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1), which plays a major role in the development of IgAN. By blocking APRIL, Voyxact lowers Gd-IgA1 levels in the blood and helps protect the kidneys from further damage.",
        "This approval matters because Voyxact is the first medicine approved by the FDA that directly targets APRIL, providing a new option for adults with IgAN who are at risk of their disease getting worse."

        "Among the first 320 patients in the study analyzed, those treated with Voyxact showed about a 50% decrease in their urinary protein level after nine months, while a 2% increase in proteinuria was observed in the placebo group. Voyxact also lowered levels of other biological markers associated with disease activity, such as, reducing APRIL levels by 95.8% and pathogenic Gd-IgA1 levels by 67.1% at week 48.",
        "Even though the drop in protein levels is promising, it’s not yet clear if Voyxact can protect kidney function over the long term. Because of this, the FDA’s approval is conditional. For the continued approval of this treatment, the manufacturing company must do more follow-up studies to confirm and clearly show that the medicine provides lasting clinical benefits.",
