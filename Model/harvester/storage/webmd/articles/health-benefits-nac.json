        "N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a supplement form of the amino acid cysteine. You get cysteine by eating high-protein foods such as beef, chicken, eggs, and whole grains. Your body can also make some cysteine by combining two other amino acids: serine and methionine. But if you're low on these two amino acids, then you may need to take a cysteine supplement.",
        "In 2022, the FDA released guidance on the use of NAC as a dietary supplement. NAC is currently excluded from the legal definition of a dietary supplement because the FDA approved it as a drug before NAC was marketed as a supplement. The FDA is now considering allowing its use in supplements due to its long history of safe use.",
