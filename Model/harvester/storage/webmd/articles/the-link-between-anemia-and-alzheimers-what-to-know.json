        "July 11, 2023 – Around 10% of people over 65 in the United States have anemia , or a shortage of iron in their blood. This is an important statistic, because researchers now believe that anemia may have a significant connection to Alzheimer's disease, or AD.",
        "A new Chinese study of over 300,000 people found that anemia was linked to a 56% higher risk of dementia . What’s more, a new study from the University of Kansas found that iron can become “sequestered” in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients, creating a deficiency that could then make the disease get worse faster.",
        "According to the Cleveland Clinic , having iron-deficiency anemia means that your body doesn’t have enough iron to make hemoglobin, a substance in your red blood cells to send oxygen through your system. It develops when your body uses up iron faster than it can be made, or when iron flow starts to slow down. Losing blood through internal bleeding, heavy menstruation, or frequent blood tests can cause iron-deficiency anemia. Pregnancy , breastfeeding, bone marrow diseases, autoimmune conditions, and not getting proper nutrition can all contribute as well. In fact, not eating enough is often how older people develop the condition."

Reiss, MD , an associate professor of medicine at NYU Long Island School of Medicine in Mineola, NY, and a member of the Alzheimer’s Foundation of America’s Medical, Scientific and Memory Screening Advisory Board. “Lack of iron can interfere with processes in the brain that affect neurotransmitters and the formation of myelin, a protein that forms a protective layer of insulation around nerves.”",

Yet anyone can have anemia, and everyone should think in terms of Alzheimer’s prevention. Here’s everything you need to know about anemia and Alzheimer’s, and the connection between the two."
