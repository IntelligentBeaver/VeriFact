        "Aug. 29, 2024 – For nearly half a century, we’ve had a clear understanding of the risks of alcohol during pregnancy . Fetal alcohol syndrome emerged in the 1970s as a risk to children exposed to alcohol in the womb, and since then, many more women have abstained from its use. But the same is not true of marijuana, and, in fact, new research shows that a surprising number of women use it during pregnancy .",
        "In an analysis of over 90,000 umbilical cord samples taken over the last 5 years, researchers at National Medical Services Labs, a laboratory testing services provider in Horsham, PA, found that nearly a fifth of those samples were positive for cannabis , another name for marijuana.",
        "“More states are legalizing cannabis, so it’s more openly available and not as stigmatized as it once was,” said Kari Midthun, PhD, a f orensic toxicologist at NMS Labs .",
        "Marijuana use is increasing across all populations, and pregnant women are another group impacted by its newfound popularity. From 1992 to 2022, the rate of daily marijuana use in the U.S. increased by 15 times. What’s more, many think of cannabis as natural and safe during pregnancy. They may also turn to it to treat prenatal symptoms like morning sickness as well as anxiety and depression, said Alexandria Reinhart, an assistant laboratory director at NMS Labs."
