        "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a slow-growing blood cancer that doesn’t always need to be treated. But when it does, targeted therapies are the kinds of drugs doctors recommend most. They’re a type of systemic treatment, which means the medicines go throughout your body. But they’re made to work directly on the cancer cells — defective versions of blood cells called B lymphocytes, or B cells, which are a part of your immune system. Targeted therapies can’t cure CLL, but they can keep it from getting worse or keep you symptom-free for months or even years."

The main types of these drugs used in CLL are the steroids dexamethasone and methylprednisone, in much higher doses than you’d get if you were taking them for a different condition. High-dose corticosteroids are usually given in combination with a monoclonal antibody drug. They can be used for CLL that is hard to treat. They can also quickly lower the amount of cancer cells in your blood to get you healthy enough for a different type of treatment. Learn more about high-dose steroids .",

        "If other types of treatments have stopped working for you, your doctor might try a targeted drug called a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. PI3K proteins help send signals that control many different cell processes. Blocking these proteins both stops cells from multiplying and encourages them to die. One PI3K inhibitor, idelalisib, is used in combination with the targeted B-cell killer rituximab. Another, duvelisib, can be taken alone. These are pills you take twice a day for as long as they keep working for you or until you can’t manage the side effects. Learn more about PI3K inhibitors ."
