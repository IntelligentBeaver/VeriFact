        "Sometimes it can get confusing to figure out if your eyesight problems are due to MS or if you are just aging. We all know that once you turn 40, your vision starts to change. It's common to have blurry vision or to need reading glasses to read the small print on the back of a medicine bottle or on a form, for example.",

        "Very often, patients get diagnosed with MS after an episode of optic neuritis, which is caused by inflammation of the optic nerve. With optic neuritis there could be changes in the perception of color, eye pain, blurry vision, or even vision loss."
