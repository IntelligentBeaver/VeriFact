        "Atherosclerosis is when plaque -- a sticky substance made of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other materials — builds up inside the walls of your arteries. Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart throughout your body.",
        "Atherosclerosis can put blood flow at risk as your arteries become blocked, and it can cause clots to form. It’s the usual cause of heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral artery disease (PAD) -- which together are called cardiovascular disease .",
        "The condition doesn't just affect blood vessels in your heart. It can happen in any of your body's arteries. But it most often appears in the major arteries that supply blood to your heart, brain, stomach, lower body, and kidneys. You can both prevent and treat this process.",
        "Arteriosclerosis. The names are similar, but atherosclerosis isn't exactly the same as arteriosclerosis.  Arteriosclerosis is a stiffening and thickening of blood vessels that can restrict blood flow to the heart and other organs. It's sometimes called hardening of the arteries. Atherosclerosis is a type of arteriosclerosis.",
