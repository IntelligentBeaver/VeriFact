        "It would be welcome news to anyone, but especially to a firefighter, whose job brings a 9% greater risk of developing cancer and a 14% greater risk of dying from it than the average person. The Mesa unit had already lost two servicemen to cancer in the previous 3 years. Both were more than a decade younger than Arenz.",
        "But when the city of Mesa offered more free screening – including a full-body MRI to firefighters over 50 – Arenz shrugged it off at first. With a negative Galleri test in hand, he didn't want to spend more time dwelling on it.",

A look through the company's website didn't set him at ease. According to Grail Bio, maker of the Galleri test, a result of \"No Cancer Signal Detected\" does not rule out cancer."
