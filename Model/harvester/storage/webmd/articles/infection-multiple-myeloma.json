But when you have myeloma, those cells don’t act the way they should. Instead of making antibodies to fight infections, they make other abnormal proteins. They also build up in your bones and crowd out other cells your body needs.",

Your doctor might watch to see how it’s growing and if you’re having symptoms. When it’s time that you do need treatment, the drugs that help to fight the cancer can leave you even more prone to getting infections .",

Your immune system may get weaker over time. So finding ways to manage any problems with your immune system and your risk for infection is key to doing well."
