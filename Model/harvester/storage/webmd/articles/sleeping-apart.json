After all, a lot of couples don't just roll over and initiate sex. They're a lot more conscious about their negotiations on sex.

If one person has been sleep-deprived, they begin to feel more interested in sex. If you've ever slept next to a person who snores, you have to cope with waking up several times during the night.
