        "Multiple myeloma is a rare type of blood cancer that affects the plasma cells in your bone marrow. Your plasma cells are like little factories that make specific proteins called antibodies. Antibodies help protect you from foreign invaders like bacteria, fungi, and viruses. When you have multiple myeloma, one of these plasma cells starts to reproduce out of control. This plasma cell will keep reproducing until it fills your bone marrow and swamps out the other cells.",

        "Because of this, your bone marrow can't make as many of the other blood cells you need: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. And the plasma cell that is growing out of control makes defective proteins (sometimes called M-proteins) that flood into your bloodstream.
