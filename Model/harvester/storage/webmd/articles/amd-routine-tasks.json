        "If age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects your sight, you may notice everyday tasks such as cooking and cleaning pose challenges they didn’t before. Once they become more of a chore, you may find yourself doing them less, which can affect your quality of life. With fewer freshly prepared meals and less cleaning, your eating habits may become less healthy and more expensive (if you eat out more often as a result) and your living conditions less safe. People who live with low vision mention struggles in the kitchen: Chopping, cutting, slicing, and dicing safely Reading recipes Checking for food freshness Measuring small amounts of liquid Setting dials on a stove or timers Cooking multiple foods at a time Telling if a dish is done cooking Handling hot dishes Food preparation taking extra time While cleaning, it can be harder to: Organize laundry by color Read appliance settings Handle a hot iron See dirt and dust on surfaces With some proactive practices and new habits, you can learn how to overcome these obstacles or modify your tasks so they’re easier to do with low vision. You can also consult with a low vision specialist. These specialists can help you learn new ways to shop, label your kitchen, and prep and store food. They can visit your home and help you set up your space and recommend adaptive tools and aids you may need."

If your countertop is the same color as your cabinets, consider contact paper or other covering that makes it stand out as a separate surface. Do the same with cabinet handles, drawer pulls, appliance knobs, and light switches so they’re easier to see. Don’t store items you need while cooking over the stove. Instead, put them in a place where you won’t have to reach over the hot surface to get them. Use color-coded labels or stickers with large letters for different types of foods so you can easily identify them.

        "Slicing, dicing, chopping, and peeling can feel risky when you can’t see well. Try these tips for extra safety: Use a vegetable peeler instead of a knife for peeling fruits and vegetables . A flexible-arm task lamp can help you better see what you’re cutting. Cutting boards with attached pivot knives promote safety. It’s best to use a cutting board that contrasts with the food you’re preparing so you know where to cut. Test to see if your knife is facing the right way for cutting by rocking it back and forth on your cutting surface. A curved edge (which many knives use for the sharp edge) will rock. Use a pizza cutter instead of a knife for cutting sandwiches. Often, measuring can present the most challenge for people living with low vision because of its precise nature. Pouring is also tricky when you can’t see the edge of the bowl or cup you’re aiming for. You may find it easiest to use adaptive tools, but you can also try these tips: If you’re measuring a dark liquid, powder, or grain, use a light measuring utensil or cup, and vice versa. Choose measuring spoons and cups with large, contrasting numbers. Use your hands to find the edge of a bowl, and rest the container you’re pouring from on top of it so you know the pour will enter correctly. Use other sensory clues to tell how much you’ve poured. You can hear the sound change and feel the weight get heavier as a container fills. Over time, you’ll become skilled at how these should sound and feel as you pour."

These practices can help: Store your cleaning supplies in a bucket or basket and take it along as you go, or wear an apron with large pockets to stash your gear. This reduces the need for many trips through the house as you clean. Spray cleaners onto your cloth instead of the surface you’re wiping down. This will help make sure you don’t leave unwiped spots behind. Use a pattern to wipe flat surfaces. You can do it in a grid pattern: up and down first, and then left to right to be sure you cover the whole area. Instead of holding a cloth, try wearing soft cotton gloves or socks on your hands to clean.",
