        "June 5, 2000 -- On a recent Saturday morning, a few small children and a swim instructor played ring-around-the-rosy during a preschool beginner's swim class for 3- to 5-year-olds at a YWCA in suburban Des Moines, Iowa. The children stood on a table placed in the shallow end. Sitting poolside, Michelle Quinn watched her daughter Bridget, almost 3, splash around.",

But other parents, says the Academy, may get a false sense of security, thinking that swim programs for the very young -- some of which welcome infants and toddlers -- can teach children to stay safe in the water."
