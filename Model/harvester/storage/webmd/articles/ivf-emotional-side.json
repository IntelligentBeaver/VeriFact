        "When Abby Fischer and her husband decided to start trying for a baby one year after getting married, they got a positive test on her first cycle. “I remember joking with my husband saying, ‘And people make it sound like this is hard!’” she says. “But then it was hard.” A few weeks later, Fischer experienced an early pregnancy loss. They tried again, but soon after came a chemical pregnancy. Still hopeful, Fischer started tracking her cycle using ovulation tests and realized she wasn’t producing an egg every cycle. With that information, and the fact that she would soon turn 35, she decided it was time to see a reproductive endocrinologist. After five rounds of ovulation-inducing medication didn’t work, their doctor told them he thought in vitro fertilization (IVF) was going to be their best bet for pregnancy success. It was the beginning of a physical and emotional roller coaster that for Fischer started with fear, sadness, and disappointment."

        "“I didn't know anyone who had done IVF,” says Fischer. “All I knew about it was that there were just going to be a lot of needles, and I’ve always been deathly afraid of needles. I really didn’t want to have to do it. It felt like a last resort.” The American Society for Reproductive Medicine estimates that almost 100,000 babies born in the U.S. each year — about 2.6% of all births — are the result of IVF. It’s a miraculous feat of science that helps people achieve pregnancy. It also takes an incredible toll on the body, minds, and spirit of those who go through it. “It’s truly all-consuming,” says Fischer. “You’re constantly thinking of medication timing, or waiting for a result, or coordinating logistics for an appointment, and on top of that you’re on artificial hormones. You don’t ever really feel like yourself.” If you’re starting an IVF journey, these facts may be daunting, but knowledge is power. When you know what to expect and learn tools to support yourself through the process, you can better prepare yourself for the road ahead."

        "The medications you take during IVF help your body grow more than one follicle at a time so that your doctors can retrieve multiple eggs in a cycle. These medications are artificial versions of hormones your brain already makes, but in much higher doses than you normally release. Your body’s not used to this overload, so as a result your mood can swing drastically. “I tell my patients that it's PMS magnified,” says Tendai M. Chiware, MD, director of the third party reproduction program at Genesis Fertility and Reproductive Medicine. “If you typically suffered from PMS signs and symptoms before IVF, it’s like that multiplied by 100.” Along with hormonal shifts can also come anxiety about whether you’re taking your medications the way you should be, and frustration and discomfort from physical symptoms like bloating, hot flashes, and headaches. Each person’s experience will differ, but one helpful predictor of how you may feel on these medications is how you typically feel during your period, says Rachael Jones, a family nurse practitioner and vice president of clinical client strategy at WIN, a provider of fertility and family benefits and services."

Social media, social gatherings, and even small talk can bring up emotions you’re not expecting. “Any pregnancy announcement, even from college acquaintances I haven't talked to in years, was like a gut punch that ruined my day,” says Fischer. “It felt like further proof that other people have working bodies that can get pregnant and stay pregnant. There was a lot of jealousy and bitterness, and then I felt really guilty about feeling jealous and bitter.”",

A good place to start is with your clinic — often they offer support groups or can point you in the direction of one. Fischer found her community through AllPaths Family Building, a nonprofit that provides an online community for people struggling with fertility and family building. “It’s helpful to have a sounding board and all of these women on a screen nodding their heads in agreement with you as you're telling your story,” says Fischer. “You feel so validated and seen and understood.” Check in with your partner. If you’re going through IVF with a partner, the experience can put a strain on your relationship, but it can also bring you closer together.
