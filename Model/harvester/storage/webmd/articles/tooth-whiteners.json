The effects are often exaggerated as we age, says Mark Wolff, DDS, professor at NYU College of Dentistry. Wear and tear creates etchings on the tooth surface, \"making teeth more susceptible to stains,\" he says. That's why you might notice that foods you've been eating for years discolor your teeth more these days."

        "Teeth whiteners, sold by dentists and drugstores, use a form of peroxide (hydrogen and carbamide are the most common) of varying strengths to oxidize or eat away the tooth's color particles to brighten smiles. The concentration of peroxide in store-bought kits ranges from 3% to 10%; in professional-grade whiteners (available in your dentist's office), it runs as high as 40%.",

This enhances the whitening effect and increases safety by minimizing the amount of peroxide that contacts the gums or is swallowed.",
