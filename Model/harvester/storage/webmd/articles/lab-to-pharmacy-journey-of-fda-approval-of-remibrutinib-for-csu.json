        "Phase III clinical trial results have shown that remibrutinib relieves itching and hives in adults with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Pending careful review of the data by the FDA, experts say the drug may offer a new treatment option for CSU. Remibrutinib is an oral medication that comes in pill form. It also works in a different way than any other drugs now in use for CSU.",
        "Up until now, doctors have mainly treated CSU with antihistamines. You may take them at high doses. Sometimes doctors will add drugs known as leukotriene modifiers. These drugs work by blocking leukotrienes, which are chemicals in your body that cause inflammation, swelling, and other symptoms. When those treatments aren't enough, you may try biologics, too. Biologics are made from monoclonal antibodies that help to block the autoimmune responses that drive CSU and many other conditions. For example, dupilumab (Dupixent) can help with the itch and hives that come with CSU. But biologics don't work for everyone. They also require regular shots. There's interest in finding new and potentially better ways to treat CSU, and that's where the story of remibrutinib's discovery and development comes in.",
        "Before remibrutinib or any other new drug can be used to treat CSU, or even be tested in clinical trials involving people, it has to go through a lengthy process of development, testing, and review. The drug development process has many steps. Promising new compounds must be tested in the lab and in animals before they're ever given to small numbers of healthy people to see the most frequent side effects, and then in people with the condition to see if it's effective. Larger trials are used to see if new drugs work. New drugs often need to work better or more safely than any existing treatments before they can be approved and made available for use on patients. It takes years, and many drugs never make it all the way through. Learn more about how the development process has evolved for remibrutinib."

        "Researchers first reported the discovery of remibrutinib, also known as LOU064, in February 2020. But the quest to find it began years before with the realization that a protein called Bruton tyrosine kinase, or BTK, was a promising target for treating CSU and other autoimmune conditions. The reason is that BTK is important for sending signals to immune cells called B cells that make antibodies. That includes the malfunctioning autoantibodies that attack your own tissues and drive autoimmune conditions, including CSU. Given the important role of those signals in autoimmunity, scientists thought drugs targeting BTK held promise for easing the itching and hives that come with CSU.",
        "This new drug is very fast. You also take it orally. There's no need for an injection. It's a BTK inhibitor, so it works by an entirely different mechanism than any drugs we've used for CSU before."

        "Remibrutinib has been approved by the FDA to treat CSU and will be available to treat CSU soon. That's based on phase III clinical trials showing the BTK inhibitor controls CSU symptoms in people who don't get relief from antihistamines. The drug also appears to be safe and well-tolerated. While it isn't yet clear if it works better than biologics, remibrutinib promises to offer an effective and fast oral option for easing the spontaneous itching and hives that come with CSU. With more study, this new medicine may find use for other conditions as well, with clinical trials now underway."
