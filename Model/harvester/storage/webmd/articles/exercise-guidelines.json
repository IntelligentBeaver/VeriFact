        "When you exercise, your body needs extra energy from blood sugar, also called glucose.",
        "When you do something quickly, like a sprint to catch the bus, your muscles and liver release glucose for fuel.",
        "Exercise usually lowers your levels. If you take insulin or diabetes meds, a boost in workout intensity or length can mean you’ll have to adjust your snacks, medication, or both. Talk to your doctor about what’s right for you.",
        "The big payoff comes when you do moderate exercise for a longer time, like a hike. Your muscles take up much more glucose when you do that. This helps lower your blood sugar levels . If you're doing intense exercise, your blood sugar levels may rise, temporarily, after you stop.",
        "Exercise that’s too hard can raise your blood sugar by making it harder for your muscle cells to use insulin. A workout helps pump you up by causing small tears in muscle fibers. When they heal, your muscles are stronger. But if you aren’t used to super-tough workouts like HIIT (high-intensity interval training), they can do so much damage that days go by before you feel like moving again. During that time, your muscle cells can’t use insulin well, and that will boost your blood sugar.",
        "It may also rise if you skip workouts. If you’re so sore you can’t make your next gym session, you probably need to dial it down. There’s no rush: It’s better to build intensity slowly as you get used to a new routine. You’re more likely to stick with it if you don’t feel like you’ve been through the wringer."
