        "Standard treatments ease depression for a lot of people, but they don't work for everyone. At least 30% of those who try two or more antidepressants continue to have serious symptoms. That's called treatment-resistant depression. If it happens to you, keep in mind that there are still ways to manage your depression. Talk to your doctor about all of your treatment choices. \"The most important point is not to give up,\" says John Krystal, MD, chair of the Department of Psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine and a pioneer in research on ketamine and depression. \"There are so many of these options – current and emerging – that can really make a difference in a person's life.\""

        "Experts don't agree on one definition. But in general, it's a form of depression that doesn't improve after you try two antidepressants from different classes of drugs. \"If you have to go to a third medication, that's the standard threshold,\" Krystal says. For example, he says your doctor might diagnose you with treatment-resistant depression after you're first treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI ), such as fluoxetine, and you don't respond. And next, you're treated with a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), such as venlafaxine or duloxetine, and you don't respond to that either. \"Medication acts as a kind of filter,\" Krystal says. \"If you respond to it, then by definition, you don't have treatment-resistant depression.\""

There's evidence that psychotherapy can ease depression in some people who don't respond well to antidepressant drugs. \"Yet, often, when we're talking about treatment-resistant depression, and thinking about interventions, we're not always including cognitive behavior therapy, family therapy, or supervised work therapy,\" Krystal says. These therapies may help: Cognitive behavioral therapy: Focuses on thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that affect your mood. CBT can help make you aware of your negative thoughts and work on changing to a more positive mindset. Dialectical behavioral therapy: Helps you grow problem-solving and acceptance skills. This is especially helpful for people who harm themselves or have repeated suicidal thoughts. Behavioral activation: Slowly lowers avoidance and isolation and helps people take part in things they once enjoyed or activities that make them feel better Group therapy: Involves other people who have depression working together with a therapist Family or marital therapy: Works on lowering stress in your relationships with family members or your spouse or partner. In many cases, this can help with your depression."

Everyone is different, but common choices may include antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, anti-anxiety medications, thyroid hormone, or other drugs. Your doctor may also suggest pharmacogenetic testing to check for specific genes that show how well you process certain antidepressants.

Your doctor might want you to go this route if nothing else works or your symptoms are really serious. These procedures include: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS): Magnetic fields are used to stimulate nerve cells in the area of your brain that involves mood and depression. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): A small dose of electricity is passed through your brain while you're asleep. That causes a short seizure, which can change the brain's chemistry to help ease symptoms of severe depression. Some side effects might happen, including confusion or memory loss , but they usually don't last a long time. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS): A device is implanted in your chest with a wire that goes to the vagus nerve in your neck. Electrical impulses go from that nerve to the area of your brain that controls moods. That may improve your depression. This procedure is usually tried only if ECT and rTMS don't work. Tell your doctor if you don't feel 100% better. The goal for your treatment should be the same as other health conditions, Krystal says, such as cancer, heart attacks, or broken bones. \"In other words, we don't go to an orthopedic surgeon and tell them, 'I broke my leg, but I want it to be 60% better.' We tell the orthopedic surgeon, 'I want my leg fixed.' \""
