        "Chronic pain is a common challenge when you have autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). But there are many treatment options to help you manage your pain and other symptoms so you can feel your best. In addition to being uncomfortable, living with chronic pain can make it harder to follow a healthy diet, may lead to anxiety and depression , and can make it harder to go about your daily life. The pain with ADPKD is usually caused by fluid-filled cysts that grow inside the kidneys and liver. When enlarging cysts stretch the capsule of the kidney, they can cause aching pain along your sides and lower back. Belly pain, headaches, chest pain , and leg pain are also common. Pain and treatments for pain affect people differently, and many things can cause pain for people with ADPKD. So it’s important to talk to your doctor about your specific problems to see what options are best for you."

Some surgeries, including those to drain fluid from cysts, may ease pain for a while, but the pain may come back as the cysts fill with fluid again over time. Removal of one or both kidneys and kidney transplantation may be an option for people with large, and/or low-functioning kidneys. A liver transplant is the last option for those with liver pain. Another option for kidney pain is transcatheter arterial embolization (also known as TAE or renal coiling), where coils are placed in the arteries connected to the kidneys to limit or block blood flow. This makes your kidneys shrink and decreases pain."
