        "When GPP occurs during pregnancy, it's called impetigo herpetiformis. It’s a form of psoriasis that causes pus filled bumps, or pustules over large areas of your body. While there are no specific statistics on how common it is in pregnant people, it does make up only about 4% of all cases of skin disease during pregnancy. Since GPP during pregnancy is very dangerous, it needs to be treated as soon as possible, says Jacob."

        "The exact cause of GPP during pregnancy is unclear. Many people who develop it have a past history of psoriasis or a family history of it. Hormonal fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone are thought to be potential triggers, says Shoshana Marmon, MD, PhD, an assistant professor in the department of dermatology at New York Medical College in Valhalla, New York. “Genetic predisposition, particularly mutations in the IL36RN gene, and immune changes during pregnancy may also play a role in its development,” she says. Some pregnant people with GPP also have low levels of calcium, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and elafin, a protein produced naturally by your skin, says Jacob."

        "If this doesn’t work, your doctor may prescribe low-dose cyclosporine. It’s a drug that suppresses your immune system. It’s thought to be fairly safe in pregnant people, but it can cause you to give birth early or have a baby with a low birth weight. Another option is the drug infliximab (Remicade). It’s a biologic often used to treat GPP that appears to be safe to use during pregnancy. You may need to stay on it for the rest of your pregnancy to prevent another flare, says Cohen. Another option that’s safe during pregnancy is phototherapy. It uses UV light to clear the GPP on your skin. It may be added if you don’t get enough help from oral steroids. One type of phototherapy, ultraviolet light B (UVB), may lower your folate levels. While you don’t need to worry about that if you’re in your third trimester, you may want to avoid it earlier in your pregnancy. Another option is PUVA.

These both work well to treat GPP, but they aren’t safe to take during pregnancy. You’re more likely to develop GPP in future pregnancies, though. Your doctor will continue to monitor you closely if you get pregnant again.",
