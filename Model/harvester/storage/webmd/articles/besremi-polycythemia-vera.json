        "Polycythemia vera (PV) is a type of blood cancer that causes your bone marrow to make too many red blood cells, which causes your blood to be too thick. Symptoms of PV usually develop slowly over many years and are usually nonspecific symptoms like headache, tiredness, sweating a lot (especially at night), itchy skin, stomach issues, and an enlarged spleen . Some of the more serious symptoms that can happen in people with PV include an increased risk of blood clots, including strokes (caused by a blood clot in your brain) and heart attacks (caused by a blood clot in your heart). Besremi (ropeginterferon alfa-2b) is a medicine that was approved by the FDA in 2021. It is a type of interferon that is injected under the skin (subcutaneously) once every two or four weeks to treat PV in adults."

        "The main component of Besremi, interferon alfa, is a type of medicine that works by affecting the bone marrow, where blood cells are made. It attaches to “docking sites” (receptors) called interferon alfa (IFNAR) receptors on cells in the bone marrow and sends signals that slow down the body’s extra blood cell production. Researchers do not know exactly how Besremi works in people with PV, but it helps to keep the blood cell counts closer to normal."
