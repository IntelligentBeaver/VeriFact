        "My first experience with physical therapy was right after college. I was horsing around in some sort of dorm activity and twisted my knee. After being off it for weeks, it was clear it wasn’t just going to heal on its own. Before long, I found myself in physical therapy once or twice per week. It was boring. The PTs were mean and stoic. I didn’t see immediate results, but eventually, my knee got stronger. I could walk for longer periods. It would be more than 20 years before I would need PT again.",
        "As I got older, I began -- like a lot of folks -- to injure myself. First, it was my shoulders and neck. Once I started working as a writer and fundraiser, I found myself at my desk all the time. I guess sitting in a hunched-over position for long hours was not the move.",
        "I entered several weeks of physical therapy to resolve this issue. I also type a lot and ended up needing PT for my right hand. I couldn’t have a little pain messing with my livelihood. The therapy included paraffin hand dips -- so I was smiling."

        "Then, I started having some pain in my lower back. To me, back pain has meant going to see a chiropractor. And while that has helped, I decided to give physical therapy a try for my lower back pain. Before I knew it, I went from having what felt like an 85-year-old back to a youthful 35-year-old back. I was able to drive for more than an hour without pain. Then, because I didn't have enough, I decided to injure my foot on the side of my bed just a few weeks after some walking strain from rushing to a super late football game. I started hearing words like plantar fasciitis and once again, I answered physical therapy. Until recently, my PT experiences were somewhat mediocre.",
        "During my weeks of therapy, I would feel good. I would do my at-home exercises inconsistently. And I often found myself returning to my same bad posture habits. Upon reflection, I also realized that some of my earlier physical therapists didn't seem as motivated to help me as the therapist I have now. I felt like just another number before. They had the canned exercises that they doled out to the host of patients who walked through the door."

        "Recently, I started a new physical therapy for some leg pain and numbness. After a round of neurological tests, it was determined that PT could be a viable solution. I hesitantly scheduled 6 weeks of physical therapy with Angie. Not only did my leg pain and numbness begin to subside, but I noted less frequent migraine episodes as well. The focused attention on stretching, breathing, and slow-focused attention on my body seemed to open up pain relief on several levels.",
        "Somehow, physical therapy had evolved from a chore I had to do to something I really looked forward to. In fact, it felt almost as relaxing as going to a spa. I kid you not! There have been times when I've gone in for PT for another part of my body, and while there I ended up getting some relief for a migraine as well. I've been so grateful to Angie for having compassion when I say I have a migraine on a particular PT day. She truly seems to care. I’ve even had a few weeks of PT for my teeth clenching, which I know has been beneficial for my migraine relief. It was the hardest PT, but I’m so grateful I gave it a try. I also have massage techniques I can do on my own."

        "Look for the helpers. Find a physical therapist who cares and demonstrates that they want you to get better. She may not know it, but I see Angie as a friend. She’s helped me return to a quality of life that I didn’t think I could regain. I am forever grateful.",
        "Do your at-home exercises . Find ways to modify them to your home environment. My PT gives me ways to do my stretches and strength exercises using things I have around the home. I do a leg stretch from PT on the side of the bathtub while brushing my teeth.",
        "Take note. Monitor if your pain is getting better, worse, or staying the same. (It should be trending toward some relief.) If your pain isn’t getting better after a few weeks of PT, you may need more time. Don’t hesitate to ask for more -- from your PT, your prescribing doctor, and your insurance company.",
        "Understand your benefits. Most insurance plans will cover a certain amount of weeks and may even extend coverage with a doctor’s note.",
        "Stay consistent! I’ve had to rearrange my work and personal schedules to make sure I stay on top of my PT appointments. I’ve noticed the most pain relief when I schedule as recommended (2-3 times per week).",
        "Use the things. I’m fortunate because my PT clinic has a lot of tools or gadgets that also offer some pain relief for me -- from cupping and traction tables to hot or cold compresses. Recently, I tried some leg warmer circulation squeezy things and they were divine. I’ve tried almost all of the bells and whistles they have, and I haven’t been disappointed yet.",
        "Encourage loved ones . My grandmother (in her late 90s) has complained of hand pain because of the diabetes finger pricks she must do every day. She recognizes that her age is a factor too. I’ve suggested physical therapy for her after seeing folks in their 90s at my PT clinic. I’ve seen kids too!"
