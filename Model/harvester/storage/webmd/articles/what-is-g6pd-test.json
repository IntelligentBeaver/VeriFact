        "It's a blood test that measures the amount of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in your body. G6PD is an enzyme that helps your red blood cells work properly. If your G6PD level is too low, you may have G6PD deficiency, which can lead to hemolytic anemia. That's when your red blood cells die faster than your body can replace them.",
        "G6PD protects your red blood cells from too many free radicals, which are unstable molecules that react with other molecules. Your body normally makes free radicals, but too many can be harmful. G6PD makes chemicals that stop free radicals from building up in your blood. When free radicals build up, they can damage your cells.",
