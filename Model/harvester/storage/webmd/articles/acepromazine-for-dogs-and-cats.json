Using it before they get general anesthesia can reduce the amount of anesthesia they need. It’s also approved to help protect dogs and cats from nausea and vomiting due to motion sickness.",
        "Dogs and cats with skin conditions may also get relief from itching while taking acepromazine, but you can get more effective anti- itch medicines. Acepromazine can be used extra-label or off-label to treat urinary blockage in male cats.",
        "Acepromazine is also prescribed extra-label or off-label for other uses in dogs and cats, as well horses, cattle, donkeys, pigs, sheep, goats, ferrets, rabbits, and small mammals. Extra-label or off-label means there’s evidence a drug is safe and effective, even if there's no FDA approval for that specific use or type of animal. Acepromazine is FDA-approved for use in dogs, cats, and horses.",
        "Acepromazine tablets are available as a prescription from your vet, or with a veterinary prescription from an online pharmacy. It’s also available as a shot given by your vet. Contact your veterinary compounding pharmacy for other dosing options."
