It might be white or really, really scaly compared to the normal areas of the lips,” Vanchinathan says.",
        "You might also experience pain or bleeding in the more advanced stages of actinic cheilitis, she says. However, she adds, “I tend to find that in general, it progresses fairly asymptomatically, and I think that’s why it’s underrecognized.”"
