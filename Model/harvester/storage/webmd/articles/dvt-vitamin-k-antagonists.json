        "If you’re being treated for a type of blood clot called a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), your doctor may have told you to watch your intake of things high in vitamin K , like spinach, kale , and even green tea . That’s because vitamin K helps your blood clot. Sudden changes in how much of these you eat or drink can interfere with a type of DVT medication called a vitamin K antagonist. These drugs hinder vitamin K’s clotting ability and reduce your chances of getting another DVT.",
        "“Coumarin” is another name for this type of drug, one of several classes of medications doctors can use to treat DVT . The most widely prescribed coumarin (and the only one available in the U.S.) is warfarin ( Coumadin , Jantoven). It was approved for human use back in 1954.",
        "You might hear vitamin K antagonists called blood thinners , but they don’t really thin your blood.",
        "Remember when you were a kid, and you got a cut that bled, then formed a scab? Our blood contains substances called clotting factors that stop bleeding and help this process. Vitamin K makes certain clotting factors. By blocking this action, vitamin K antagonists slow the clotting process. This helps keep clots that you have from getting larger and stop new ones from forming. They don’t stop clotting completely, but help blood flow through your veins more easily."
