Both men and women are diagnosed with this autoimmune arthritis in similar numbers. But their experiences with the disease are often very different. Your gender can have an effect on your diagnosis, symptoms, and response to treatment. Learning how it plays a role can help you slow psoriatic arthritis and pump the brakes on joint damage."

        "There's no single test to diagnose PsA. Doctors depend on imaging tests, physical exams, and your medical history to make a diagnosis. You will probably also get a blood test to rule out rheumatoid arthritis . A timely diagnosis is your first step to getting the upper hand on your disease. A recent review of multiple studies shows that women get their psoriatic arthritis diagnosis about 10 years later than men. In general, American men are diagnosed in their 40s and women in their 50s. A few things could explain this: Doctors may suspect health problems common in women like osteoarthritis ,  rheumatoid arthritis, or fibromyalgia before testing for psoriatic arthritis. Doctors also may misdiagnose these complaints of pain as depression , especially in women. Psoriatic joint damage affects men at an earlier age and can be seen on X-ray clearly. This may be due in part to the fact that men tend to have higher-impact physical occupations and sports activities, which inflames joints. Women’s PsA isn’t easily seen on X-ray in its early stages. More sensitive imaging tests like ultrasound or MRI may be needed for diagnosis."

It also can affect sperm count and motility. PsA doesn’t typically affect a woman’s ability to conceive kids. Let your rheumatologist and your dermatologist know if you’re thinking about having a baby, even if it’s months from now. You and your doctor will need to look at your medications closely to make sure they’re safe for a fetus. Methotrexate is a common drug used for psoriatic arthritis. Since It carries a small possibility of birth defects, doctors recommend that both men and women stop this drug at least 3 months before trying to conceive. If you have an unplanned pregnancy, get in touch with your doctors right away. You’ll need to make a plan to manage your arthritis and protect your unborn baby."
