        "Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) is a rare problem that affects your nerves and muscles. With LEMS , your immune system mistakenly attacks the place where your nerves and muscles connect. This damages nerve endings, reduces the amount of acetylcholine (a chemical that helps nerves and muscles communicate), and keeps your muscles from working properly. It can cause severe muscle weakness and tiredness that is progressive (gets worse over time). Firdapse (amifampridine) is an FDA-approved treatment for LEMS."

        "Study 1 started with 38 people with LEMS (84% had autoimmune LEMS, and 16% had paraneoplastic LEMS). The people in this study ranged in age from 21 to 88 years. About 61% of the people in study 1 were women, and most people were White (90%). Race information for the other people in the study was not provided. There was an open-label run-in phase where everyone in the study took Firdapse, and everyone knew they were taking Firdapse. At the end of the open-label run-in phase, QMG, SGI, and CGI-I scores were measured for everyone in the study. Then the 38 people were divided into two groups. During this part of the study, neither the people in the study nor the study investigators knew who was taking Firdapse and who was taking a placebo (no medicine in it). Sixteen of the 38 people continued to take Firdapse. Twenty-two of the people slowly switched from Firdapse to a placebo over seven days. For the next seven days, people in the study continued taking Firdapse or a placebo. Then QMG, SGI, and CGI-I measurements were repeated.",

People who had recently taken certain medicines, including azathioprine, cyclosporin, immunoglobulin G, mycophenolate, or rituximab, or those who had recently received plasmapheresis, were not eligible to be in the study. The people ranged in age from 31 to 75 years with an average age of 54 years. About 62% of the people were women, and most people were White (88%). One person was African American, and the race of two people was not provided. People in the study were allowed to keep taking stable doses of certain medicines, such as cholinesterase inhibitors or corticosteroids. Baseline QMG and SGI scores were measured.
