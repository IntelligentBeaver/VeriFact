        "Breyanzi was studied in people with relapsed or refractory LBCL that had come back within 12 months of their initial treatment and were candidates for autologous HSCT (transplant from your own stem cells). People got either Breyanzi or standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy followed by HSCT for those who had a response. The primary endpoint of this study was event-free survival (EFS), which was how long people were free of any event such as cancer progression, recurrence, or death. The study also looked at progression-free survival (PFS), which measured the length of time people went without progression of their cancer or death, and complete response rate (CRR). Complete response means that after treatment, there are no signs of cancer. There were 184 people in this study and they were split evenly between the two groups. The median age was 59 years old (range: 20 to 75) and 57% of people were male. Fifty-nine percent were White, 10% were Asian, and 4% were Black. Median EFS was significantly longer in the Breyanzi group at 10.1 months versus 2.3 months in the SOC group. This means that people that got Breyanzi went an average of about eight months longer without progression, relapse, or death than those who did not get Breyanzi. EFS rates were also longer in the Breyanzi group (63%) versus the SOC group (33%) at six months. Sixty-six percent of people that got Breyanzi had a complete response and 39% of people who got SOC had a complete response. This means that 66% of people that got Breyanzi had no signs of cancer after their treatment. After Breyanzi, the median time of progression-free survival, meaning people saw no progression of their cancer, was 14.8 months versus 5.7 months for those that did not get Breyanzi."

People were allowed to be in this trial if they had a previous HSCT. There was one group in this trial where people received chemotherapy followed by Breyanzi. The study looked at objective response rate (ORR), which measured how effective Breyanzi was by looking at the percentage of people who had either a PR or CR. It also looked at the dOR. The median age in this trial was 63 (range: 18 to 86) and 69% were male. Eighty-four percent of the people were White, 6% were Black, and 4.7% were Asian. Seventy-three percent of the people had a response to Breyanzi and 54% had a complete response. In people that had any type of response, the response lasted about 16.7 months.",
