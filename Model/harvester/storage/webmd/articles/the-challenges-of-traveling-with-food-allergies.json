Navigating new places where you don’t speak the language, or where food safety standards might be different, can make even the most adventurous traveler a little hesitant. And let’s be honest, the last thing anyone wants is to have an allergic reaction in an unfamiliar environment. But here’s the thing: Travel should be accessible for everyone, and that includes those of us with food allergies.",

I spent six months traveling around South America this year, and while everyone else was tasting street food or trying a local dish, I was often left worrying about cross-contamination or hidden allergens. And of course it’s not about being picky – it’s about staying safe."
