        "Osteoarthritis is a type of arthritis that happens when the cushioning between your joints wears down over time. It can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling in the joints. It’s most common in older adults. Osteoarthritis can affect any joint in the body, but it usually affects the knees, hips, and hands. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that makes your joints hurt and swell. It happens when your body’s defense system attacks your joints by mistake. This can cause the lining of your joints to get swollen and painful. If it’s not treated, it can damage your bones and make your joints look different. Unlike osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis is not caused by age-related wear and tear, and it can affect people of all ages. Treatments depend on the type of arthritis you have and how bad the symptoms are. For both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, your doctor might recommend managing pain and swelling with over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. Here are some of the most common OTC treatments for arthritis."

Each of these medicines can ease pain, but not all of them work the same way. Before buying or taking an OTC pain reliever, it’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor or pharmacist first.
