        "Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) occurs when you associate the taste of certain foods with symptoms of an illness. Taste aversions are relatively common in humans. They are an adaptive trait that goes a long way in protecting you against eating illness-inducing things like bacteria and fungi.",
        "In children, the discovery and acceptance of tastes start as early as three to six months. Their reaction to different tastes also evolves with age. That’s why infants are more likely to reject new foods if it results in a negative experience such as an upset stomach or diarrhea . You may notice that your child avoids that specific food in the future."
