        "Clinical trials are a type of research that has people as the subjects. They're the main way researchers can tell if a new treatment – be it a medical device, a drug, a diet , a behavior, or any other remedy – works and is safe for the general public to use. Often a clinical trial compares how a new treatment might have better results or fewer side effects than ones currently used. Though the drugs used in a trial often aren’t FDA-approved yet – which is one purpose of the trial – the FDA does have to give the green light for a clinical trial to proceed. Clinical trials also can reveal how health care professionals might spot the disease sooner, without needing it to worsen first. They can also find new ways to improve your quality of life."

        "The answer is, all kinds of people, and very specific people. Clinical trials are highly targeted to distinct groups – such as people who don’t respond to current remedies – to better home in on how effective a new drug or treatment is. At the same time, they want to cast a net wide enough to make sure it serves diverse groups of people. Whether you might be a good pick for a trial will depend on many things, including: Your age How serious your condition is: Some trials testing various new drugs are targeted to more severe cases, while others focus on milder ones. Whether you’re eligible for treatments such as chemotherapy If you’ve tried the treatment being tested before Whether you have co-conditions, such as anemia Even though you might meet the basic criteria, researchers will further whittle down candidates based on more in-depth reasons. For example, they may ask if your cancer has certain molecular markers that might affect the outcome. So by design, you’d likely qualify for just a handful of current clinical trials."
