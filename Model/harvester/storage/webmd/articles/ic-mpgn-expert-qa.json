        "You can understand immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis best by breaking the name into its two main parts. First is immune complex, which is a molecule formed when our immune systems are trying to fight a foreign body. So anytime you have an infection, your body forms an immune complex in order to clear the infection. In the case of IC-MPGN, immune complexes form in parts of the kidney even though infection isn’t present, causing inflammation in the filters of the kidney (glomeruli).",
        "The second part, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, refers to the histologic aspect of disease, meaning, how does it look under the microscope? And when we look at IC-MPGN under the microscope, we see inflammation in the glomeruli. If you think about the kidney as a collecting system, the filters are glomeruli. Glomerulonephritis means inflammation of the glomeruli. Membranoproliferative is a term that means the filtering membrane on the glomeruli is thickened. You have a lot of cells that are invading these filters. So you have an inflammation of the filter with thickening of the filtering membrane. That's what we see on the kidney biopsy under the microscope."
