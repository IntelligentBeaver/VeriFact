        "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a kidney condition that is passed down from parents to their children. This condition causes fluid-filled sacs (or cysts) to form on the kidneys. Over time, as more of these cysts form, the kidneys begin to change shape, growing much larger and eventually losing their ability to function correctly.",
        "People with this condition usually do not develop symptoms until adulthood and are most often diagnosed between the ages of 30 to 50. One of the most common symptoms of ADPKD is high blood pressure. Many people with this condition also experience pain near the kidneys due to various causes, including infections in the kidneys and urinary tract, bursting cysts, and kidney stones."

Your health care provider may recommend other lifestyle changes as well, such as exercising, limiting your salt intake, and quitting smoking.",

The active ingredient, tolvaptan, blocks a substance in the body called vasopressin from binding to the vasopressin V2-receptor in the kidneys. In people with ADPKD, this slows down the creation of new cysts and the growth of old cysts, helping the kidneys to maintain their function for longer."
