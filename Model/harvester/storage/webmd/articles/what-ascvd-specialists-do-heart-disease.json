Plaque narrows the arteries, which hinders blood flow. Blood clots can also form when plaque bursts. When you live with ASCVD, you’ll need to understand the causes, what may make it worse, and how to avoid further complications. Usually, health care providers suggest maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Here’s a detailed look at the different members of the ASCVD health care team and the parts they play in treating the disease."

They also order tests to learn more about your condition and will make treatment suggestions like medicine, exercise, and more nutritious foods. Cardiologists diagnose and treat coronary artery disease through tests called cardiac catheterization. In this procedure, the doctor will insert thin tubes called catheters into your artery to help spot narrowed or blocked arteries and find out the degree of damage before they clear the blockage. A cardiologist may also perform a coronary angioplasty. This procedure puts a balloon catheter into narrowed or blocked arteries of your heart to boost blood flow. They could also place a stent in the artery to keep it open after surgery."
