        "Can caffeine stunt your growth? There are a lot of misconceptions when it comes to answering this question. Specifically, in children, coffee and growth are somewhat linked, but not directly.",
        "The caffeine in coffee drinks has a stimulating effect on your body and mind. This means it increases your alertness, focus, and heart rate . When young people consume too much caffeine before bedtime, their sleep is affected. The effects of sleep deprivation have more to do with stunted growth than coffee itself.",
        "Drinking caffeine in the hours before bedtime interrupts your sleep patterns. Sleep is especially important for children and teenagers to develop properly. Therefore, young people who drink caffeine up to six hours before bedtime are likely to have trouble sleeping. This prevents their body from producing the growth hormone that helps them grow taller.",
        "Pediatricians advise against caffeine for children under age 12 and against any use of energy drinks for all children and teens. They also suggest limiting caffeine to, at most, 100 mg (about two 12-oz. cans of cola) daily for those ages 12-18.",
        "Another reason many people believe coffee stunts your growth is that most children reach their final height in their teens. This is around the age young people begin to drink coffee and other caffeinated drinks. It's easy to draw the conclusion that coffee is what stunts young teenagers' growth when in reality, coffee and growth have little to do with each other."
