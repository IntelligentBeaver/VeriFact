In fact, it often results in chronic kidney disease, a gradual loss of kidney function. As your ADPKD gets worse, you may get chronic kidney disease, which has five stages. Doctors stage kidney disease according to a test called estimated glomerular filtration rate , or eGFR. This measures how well your kidneys filter waste and extra fluid from your blood."
