You might first notice one under your skin that sticks around for weeks or months. Later, more may appear.

With good and early treatment, you may be able to avoid the more serious long-term effects of HS and live well with the condition. There’s no cure for HS, but a dermatologist will create a plan to get the disease under control and ease your symptoms.
