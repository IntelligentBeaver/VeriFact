        "Chorea is an uncontrolled movement disorder caused by a hereditary condition called Huntington’s disease . A hereditary condition is a condition that is passed down from your parents. Huntington’s disease causes nerve cells in the brain to break down and cause thinking, emotional, and movement problems.",
        "Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a disorder that can cause repetitive movements such as twitching, shaking, or jerking in the arms, legs, face (including eyes and mouth), and torso. Certain medicines such as antipsychotics that are used to treat mental health conditions and medicines that are used to treat stomach issues can cause TD.",
        "Monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine work to carry messages from one cell to the next, including muscle and nerve cells. When too much of these neurotransmitters are signaled by your cells, it can cause movement that you cannot control. Austedo works to lower the amount of neurotransmitters sent by the cells, which in turn can lead to fewer uncontrolled movements."
