        "Your liver is part of your digestive system, so you may only think of it in terms of its role in digestion. In reality, your whole body depends on your liver. If your liver isn’t working properly, eventually other organs will struggle, too, and that includes your brain. Many liver problems can lead to liver damage that’s severe enough to also affect the function of other organs. If you have metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly referred to as non-alcoholicfatty liver disease, it’s important to understand how these conditions can cause problems for your brain if they’re not treated and well controlled. Let’s take a look at what your liver does and why its function is critical to your brain health."

        "When there’s glucose in your bloodstream that your body doesn’t need for energy right away, your liver turns it into glycogen and stores it for later. If your liver is damaged to the point that it can no longer do this job, sugar levels in your bloodstream rise. When you’ve got too much sugar in your blood on an ongoing basis, it can lead to type 2 diabetes.

MRI studies have also shown that people with MASLD and MASH have less blood flow in their brain than people without these conditions. Less blood flow to your brain can harm your thinking skills and raise your risk for stroke. People who have these liver diseases may also have more white matter lesions on their brains. These are seen as a sign of small blood vessel disease in the brain and they raise risk for stroke, loss of memory and thinking skills, depression, disability, and death. These signs could explain why studies show that people at high risk for liver damage are more likely to have problems with executive function (skills you use for managing everyday tasks), abstract reason (your ability to think about ideas and concepts), and overall thinking skills."
