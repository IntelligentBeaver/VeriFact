        "Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare condition where small, wart-like tumors grow in the airway. These growths are called papillomas. They are usually not cancerous but can lead to serious breathing problems.",
        "The growths can appear anywhere in the respiratory tract, but they most often affect the voice box (larynx) and windpipe (trachea). These growths are also known as laryngotracheal papillomas. The most common symptom of RRP is hoarseness, which can worsen over time. If the growths block the airway, other problems such as coughing, trouble swallowing, or severe breathing problems may happen.",
