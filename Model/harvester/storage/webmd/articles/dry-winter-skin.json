I'm one of the many dermatologists who like to recommend a non-pore-clogging face wash that leaves skin soft and hydrated. This one contains only what your skin needs. It's mild, so if you have sensitive skin you will be able to use this twice a day. Bonus: Many of my women patients claim it's the best makeup remover they've ever used.\"",

When you step out of the shower, pat dry and apply a body cream. This one has ceramides that replace the skin's natural oils.\""
