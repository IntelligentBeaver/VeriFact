        "Hyrnuo (sevabertinib) is a medicine called a kinase inhibitor that is used to treat a certain type of lung cancer called non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) . NSCLC is caused by an abnormal human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene. It is the most common type of lung cancer, but HER2-mutated NSCLC occurs in only about 2% - 4% of people with NSCLC. Hyrnuo is a treatment that works by targeting and blocking HER2 signals in NSCLC cells."
