These partly broken-down carbohydrates form the main part of the sticky and acidic film that makes up plaque.",

If you have a lot of tartar, swollen gums, or sensitive teeth (this is usually due to gum recession which exposes your tooth's root), you may be more likely to have discomfort when your dental hygienist removes your tartar. If you're worried about it, talk to your dentist. They may be able to numb your gums before you get your cleaning."
