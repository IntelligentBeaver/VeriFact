Both options can take some getting used to, but when you use them right, they can keep your airways open at night so you can get restful, quality sleep. As you begin wearing these treatments, you may have an adjustment period with some discomfort. It’s important to learn what you can work on to make things easier, and what’s abnormal."

All three options involve wearing a mask or other device that fits over your nose or your nose and mouth together.

        "It will probably be an adjustment learning how to sleep comfortably with a CPAP on your face. You can ease into it by wearing your device during the day for short periods of time – like while you’re watching TV. Start by wearing it turned off, and then practice wearing it while the machine is running. The sooner you start wearing it to sleep, the faster you’ll get used to it. You should get to a point where you can wear the CPAP comfortably every time you sleep, even during naps. You may also need some time to learn to tolerate forced air. Some machines come with a “ramp” feature that starts with low pressure and slowly moves up to higher air pressure as you fall asleep. You may find it most comfortable to use a BiPAP, since it gives you high-pressure air only as you breathe in and lowers it as you breathe out. Some people report feeling claustrophobic (like you’re uncomfortably confined in a small space) when they wear their CPAP masks. Wearing your mask some during the day may help your body get used to the feeling. You can also practice relaxation techniques after you put it on that can ease anxiety."

        "There are various types of masks and devices that can deliver the air to your airways. If the type you have continues to bother you even after you’ve worn it for a while, talk to your doctor about trying one that fits differently. Nasal pillow masks fit in your nostrils only and sit slightly below the nose. Nasal masks fit over your nose only. Full face masks cover your nose and mouth. Oral masks cover only your mouth. Keep in mind that you’ll also need to consider things such as how often you move around in your sleep, whether you have facial hair, and what type of air pressure you need to help you choose the right mask. No matter which type of mask you choose, make sure the sizing is also correct. Your straps will make some adjustment possible, but check with your doctor that you’re using the correct size to fit your face comfortably. In addition to letting the air you need leak out, a mask that doesn’t fit well can point air toward your eyes, drying them out. Your nose may also get dried out, and your skin may get irritated. Your priority should be getting a mask that fits well, but you can try petroleum jelly on your skin and saline spray for your nose to help with dryness in the meantime."
