        "July 11, 2023 – The European Medicines Agency is investigating Ozempic and another drug that leads to weight loss amid fears that the medicines may increase the risk of suicide.",
        "The agency’s safety committee , which handles safety studies on medicines that have been authorized for use, met last week. The investigation comes after an Icelandic health authority reported three cases of thoughts of suicide or self-harm among people who were taking Ozempic or a similar drug called Saxenda, according to the news agency Reuters .",
        "Both drugs are made by the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk. Ozempic is approved in the U.S. for managing diabetes but has become well-known for its weight loss effects. Saxenda is FDA-approved for weight loss but hasn’t experienced the fame of other weight loss medicines that are more effective. The drugmaker issued a statement to multiple media outlets stating that safety is the company’s top priority and all adverse event reports are treated very seriously."
