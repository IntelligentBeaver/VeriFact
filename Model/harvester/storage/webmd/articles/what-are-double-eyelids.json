If, on the other hand, you have monolids, or single eyelids, your epicanthal fold — which is the skin on top of your eyelid — extends to the inside corner of your eye.",

For example, if you’re a person of English descent who lives in America, you may have never given a second thought to your eyelids — but in Korea, getting eyelid surgery to make one’s eyes look bigger is very common.",

If you have drooping eyelids because of age, or if you have trouble seeing clearly because of heavier eyelids, you may wish to schedule a plastic surgery consultation to make yourself more comfortable.
