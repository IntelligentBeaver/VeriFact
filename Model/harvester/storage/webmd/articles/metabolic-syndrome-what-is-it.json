It helps get glucose — a sugar made from the food you eat — into cells in your muscles, liver, and fat, where it’s used for energy or stored for later. When insulin resistance develops, those cells require more than normal amount of insulin to take in the glucose they need. If your pancreas does not make enough insulin, the glucose will remain in your bloodstream, elevating your blood sugar (or blood glucose) level. Eventually, this can lead to diabetes .

Free fatty acids and insulin resistance also raise your LDL (or “bad”) cholesterol and lower your HDL (or “good”) cholesterol, as well as boost your blood pressure and your triglycerides.

It helps get glucose — a sugar made from the food you eat — into cells in your muscles, liver, and fat, where it’s used for energy or stored for later. When insulin resistance develops, those cells require more than normal amount of insulin to take in the glucose they need. If your pancreas does not make enough insulin, the glucose will remain in your bloodstream, elevating your blood sugar (or blood glucose) level. Eventually, this can lead to diabetes .

Free fatty acids and insulin resistance also raise your LDL (or “bad”) cholesterol and lower your HDL (or “good”) cholesterol, as well as boost your blood pressure and your triglycerides.
