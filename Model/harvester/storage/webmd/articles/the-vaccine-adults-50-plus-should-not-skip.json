But when she awoke days later with disabling vertigo – vomiting every time she tried to stand – she knew something else was wrong.",
        "\"The ENT [ear, nose, and throat doctor] came in and took one look and said, 'This is shingles. Every medication you're taking is not correct,'\" said Junker, now 52, a medical journal editor in Centerville, Virginia.",

New research now shows that getting the vaccine – either before or after a shingles episode – not only reduces the risk of a devastating case like Junker's but also lowers the risk of vascular dementia and heart problems."
