        "March 14, 2018 -- Former Congressman Patrick Kennedy has been a key voice in the national debate about the opioid epidemic. A recovering addict himself, the Democrat from the legendary Kennedy political family has called for policy and financial commitments from the federal government to help fight the problem. Kennedy has also tried to draw the connection between addiction and mental health . While in the U.S. House of Representatives, Kennedy sponsored legislation that requires insurance companies to treat mental illness , depression , and addiction the same as they treat illnesses of the body. The bill, known as the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, was signed into law in 2008. Kennedy is also a member of President Donald Trump's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. He spoke with WebMD recently about the current crisis, his own experiences with addiction, and what America should be doing. Here is an edited version of the conversation. You've often said if we had the will to end this epidemic we could do it today. If we did have that will, what would we be doing?"

        "When it came to Zika, we had all the money we needed. And we didn't even know how to treat or interdict it. We were totally in the dark. But the money was there. In this case we know exactly what works and yet there's no money there. In this case, obviously we're losing upwards of 200 people a day. When HIV /AIDS hit, we were spending $24 billion a year to tackle a crisis that claimed 53,000 Americans. And now we're losing far more than that, 64,000 in a conservative count, and we can't even get half a billion. WebMD: Many of the people who read our work on opioids are concerned about how they will continue to get opioids. These are people with chronic pain who aren't abusing them but have used these drugs for years with medical instruction. In many cases they already face more difficult hurdles to filling prescriptions. What should they do?"

        "We do have a major epidemic of real physical pain and we have an epidemic of perceived physical pain, combined with real psychic pain, which is driving a lot of the overusage. The fact of the matter is there is no one-size-fits-all. Real pain needs to be constantly tackled in terms of new and emerging ways to treat it. And there are several new, emerging ways to treat it. When we did our commission hearing, we heard from several companies that were dramatically reducing the needs for opioids, from hospitals, especially from surgical pain because there are new types of interventions. We heard from pharma about how we had several promising approaches coming down the line. We need to be finding ways to treat pain aggressively. We found, when I was in Rhode Island, we did a survey of those who had lost loved ones in these hospitals. And then a big source of outrage was they lost their loved ones in agonizing pain and that their pain wasn't properly being treated. I don't think anyone wants us to risk those days again. I do worry that the pendulum can come back so strong that we can end up ignoring the very legitimate need to treat in pain."

        "I'm concerned the pendulum will swing back to underprescribing from overprescribing. We just need something different to prescribe, to maximize all these options. There have been many, many stories about people who have become addicted to opioids being taken advantage of in various ways. Whether it's manufacturers of medications to treat addiction hiking prices or so-called addiction treatment centers that string addicts along long enough to drain their benefits or bank accounts. How should someone who needs help get it? Kennedy: It's really incumbent upon the medical community to step up and serve patients. We're looking at this as an addiction or mental health problem when this is a medical problem. The AMA (American Medical Association) to date has done very little to try and move this whole discussion forward. They're even missing in action on helping to facilitate more prescribing of buprenorphine , for example, which is the [medically preferred] form of treatment for opioid use disorder. And, frankly, the most cost-effective. You could give someone full-year coverage of opioid use disorder, solve the cravings, prevent the overdose, and provide mental health cognitive behavior therapy and do it at a fraction of a cost to fly someone down to (a rehab center) or one of these fly-by-night treatment places in sunny places."

But then, you know, we waited and waited, and the next thing that happened was a nearly $2 trillion tax cut. You're saying we need $200 billion over 10 years if we're going to be anywhere near the vicinity of HIV/AIDS. Now we're passing a tax cut that is going to cost $2 trillion over 10 years.

While in the U.S. House of Representatives, Kennedy sponsored legislation that requires insurance companies to treat mental illness, depression and addiction the same as they treat illnesses of the body. The bill, known as the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, was signed into law in 2008.",
