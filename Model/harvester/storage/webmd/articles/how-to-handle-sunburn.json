When it comes to protecting your skin from the sun's rays, prevention is always better than treating it after the fact. But we’re human, and sometimes sunburns do happen. Yes, even I have had this happen. Usually, it’s due to forgetting to rub in our sunscreen over an area of skin or forgetting to reapply.",

        "Cool off the skin by taking a cool shower or applying cool compresses to any areas of skin that are particularly hot or burning. This helps calm down inflammation, and it feels so good!",
        "Apply a moisturizer to help lock in moisture as the sunburn heals. Avoid petrolatum-based products as they can occlude the skin and keep you too hot and uncomfortable. Instead, stick to a thick cream-based moisturizer. This is especially helpful as the skin starts to peel.",
        "Take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory product like aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen to help with any pain or burning you may feel. This helps calm down the inflammatory response that happens when the skin is sunburnt.",
        "Be sure to stay hydrated with plenty of water or a sports drink containing electrolytes, especially as the skin peels. As we lose our skin barrier during a sunburn, we also lose hydration, so replenishing this is key."
