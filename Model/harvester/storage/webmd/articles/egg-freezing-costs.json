        "Freezing your eggs earlier may help you avoid multiple IVF cycles later and reduce your overall fertility costs. A 2023 cost-effectiveness study using national fertility data found that freezing eggs at age 33 and using them at 43 led to a higher chance of having a baby compared to IVF alone at 43 and saved more than $30,000 on average. If you hope to have two children, the savings could be greater. Two cycles of egg freezing in your early 30s were linked to much higher success rates and savings of more than $80,000 compared to delaying treatment. The study also found that freezing your eggs before age 39 was generally more affordable in the long run than waiting, but the best success rates and savings came when eggs were frozen before age 32."
