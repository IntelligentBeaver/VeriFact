        "When you’re pregnant and get contractions, it means the muscles of your uterus are tightening and releasing. The contractions help widen (dilate) your cervix to help your baby journey through the birth canal. All that usually signals that you’re about to go into labor. But sometimes contractions don’t make your cervix change the way it would if your labor had started for real. Your doctor may describe this as uterine contractions without cervical change. Some people call this “prodromal labor” (prodromal means early signs). Others refer to it as “false labor.” But doctors avoid both terms because they consider them imprecise or misleading."

        "Braxton-Hicks contractions are another type that don’t change your cervix. They may come on less regularly than prodromal labor. You may have Braxton-Hicks contractions in the evening or after you’ve moved a lot. You might get one or two contractions an hour. They are more distinct and often may feel like tightening in one part of your womb. But you might not feel anything. Shifting your body or walking can help end the contractions.",
        "Real labor, by contrast, usually happens in three stages. It starts with regular contractions. They can come every 5-15 minutes and last 60-90 seconds in the beginning. In the first stage of labor, your cervix opens and thins to let your baby move into the birth canal. A pink or bloody discharge may appear as this happens. This could be the mucus plug at the end of your cervix releasing. If you see heavy bleeding or your water breaks, call your doctor right away.",
        "The first stage can last for 12-19 hours or less. You should give your doctor updates and they will tell you what to do next.",
        "Over time, your contractions grow stronger, last longer, and happen more often as you move into the second stage of labor. You might feel cramps in your legs and lower back pressure."
