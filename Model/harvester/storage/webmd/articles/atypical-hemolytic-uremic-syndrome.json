        "Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a disease that causes blood clots in small blood vessels in your kidneys and other organs. These clots keep blood from getting to your kidneys, which can lead to serious medical problems, including kidney failure. There's no cure, but treatment can help manage the condition.",

Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is rare. Experts don't know exactly how many people have it, but some studies say it affects only 2 people out of every million in the U.S."
