These are intense surgeries. My perspective is that it’s not worth the loss of two years of a child’s life to go through limb lengthening so that they can be 10 inches taller. It can also cause complications, like joint stiffness, which limit function. But I do know quite a few adults with achondroplasia who did do limb lengthening between the ages of 10 and 12 and are very happy with that decision."
