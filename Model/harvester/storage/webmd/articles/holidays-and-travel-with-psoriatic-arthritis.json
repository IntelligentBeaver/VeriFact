        "In my early days with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), our travel for vacations and holidays was normal.",
        "However, as the years went by, my PsA began to interfere with my mobility despite successful knee and hip replacements.",
        "My wife and I discovered that travel by cruise ship worked well since we did not have to pack and repack, and the cruise ships usually docked within reasonable distance from the places we wanted to visit. This was particularly true with a river cruise that we took on the Danube. Many of the older European cities were built around a river, so the downtown area and commercial zone is within walking distance from the pier at which we docked (Budapest comes to mind). Walking tours offered by the cruise line provided a terrific introduction to the cultural, political, and religious life of the riverfront cities without much physical effort. We have also found that travel to Hawaii provides a relaxing opportunity, with beautiful beaches and hotel pools close to the resort rooms."

        "Because I have had multiple joint replacements, my family has come to realize that my physical limitations prevent me from doing certain things. For example, we traveled to Ireland many years ago, and my wife and daughter wanted to experience “kissing the Blarney Stone.” When I realized that the Blarney Stone was located at the top of a tall tower (128 narrow stone steps), I let them go by themselves. (This was pre-COVID; I cannot imagine that anyone would consider this a sanitary activity forever more.)",
        "Similarly, when we visited the Vatican, I had to pass on climbing the steps to the top of the cathedral (551 steps). I have also had to restrict myself from taking certain rides at amusement parks, specifically Disneyland, due to issues with my neck and back.",
        "Although I used to ice skate when I was a teenager and once did some skiing, ever since my knee replacement surgery, I have not even considered engaging in either of those sports. I am grateful that I had the chance to do mountain climbing in the Yosemite, Grand Teton, and Yellowstone National Parks when I was a teenager because any such activity would be out of the question following my replacement surgeries."

        "I have greatly restricted my airplane travel due to the pandemic. However, I did take a trip to New York City for a retirement dinner for one of my volunteer boards. I used a walking cane, and I pre-arranged for a close-in parking space, a wheelchair to take me to the gate from the departure ticket counter and at the destination, and used taxi and Uber cars at the destination rather than walking any great distance. I reserved an ADA-accessible room, so I had use of a walk-in shower and grab bars in the bathroom to avoid falling. I wore a mask all the time, in order to minimize my contact with any other people along the way or at the dinner.",
        "I have found that while it is important to know your limits, there is no reason why you should not try to enjoy life and travel to the extent possible and practicable. I cannot imagine going to more than two destinations on any one trip. Packing and repacking and loading and unloading are too great a physical burden and toll on me and my wife. I have a 5-pound limit for lifting with either arm due to shoulder replacement surgery, so rolling luggage is a necessity, as is the use of valets whenever available."
