        "Bronchiectasis is a long-term lung condition where the airways stay widened and inflamed. These airway changes make it harder to breathe and clear mucus.",
        "People with bronchiectasis live with a constant wet cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and frequent respiratory infections. People also experience flare-ups (exacerbations) when their symptoms get worse and may even require a hospital stay. The condition tends to get worse over time due to an ongoing cycle of mucus buildup, infections, and airway inflammation.",
        "Bronchiectasis can be caused by cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder that leads to very thick mucus. When it happens in people without CF, it’s called non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, or NCFB for short. It affects about half a million people in the U.S.",
        "Until recently, medical care for NCFB mainly focused on easing symptoms. In August 2025 , the FDA approved Brinsupri (brensocatib) as the first medicine to treat NCFB.",
        "Brinsupri may also be used for other conditions as determined by your health care provider. This article covers some frequently asked questions about Brinsupri for bronchiectasis."
