        "\"In our eyes this was such a significant improvement that, in good conscience, we could not continue to accept conventional pap smears,\" Galup says. That decision caused problems for the lab, because many insurers would not pay the extra $15 to $20 for the procedure. Through public awareness campaigns, however, the lab has been able to regain any business it lost when it switched to ThinPrep. \"The number of Pap tests we are analyzing is greater than before,\" Galup says.",

That's the kind of across-the-board increase that could disrupt the whole system,\" she says."
