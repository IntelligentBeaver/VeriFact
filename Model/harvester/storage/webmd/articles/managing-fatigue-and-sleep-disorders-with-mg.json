Then I came across something interesting: Women’s circadian rhythms are different from men’s, and hormonal changes throughout the month can affect sleep patterns. It turns out many women actually need more rest at certain times in their cycle."

It’s often a side effect of chronic inflammation, reduced appetite, or even steroid use, which can mess with absorption. The problem is, low iron can make fatigue exponentially worse, adding another layer of exhaustion to an already energy-draining condition.",

        "The science behind it is simple. Our bodies are naturally programmed to wake up with the rising sun, thanks to our circadian rhythm, which regulates sleep and wakefulness based on light exposure. By gradually increasing light before waking, the lamp mimics a natural sunrise, triggering your body to reduce melatonin (the sleep hormone) and increase cortisol levels, helping you wake more gently and feel more alert in the morning. Over time, this helped stabilize my sleep cycle and made falling asleep at night much easier.",
        "I also looked into magnesium, which is known to help with sleep. But here’s where things got tricky. Magnesium supplements can be dangerous for people with MG. In some cases, they can trigger a myasthenic crisis, which isn’t exactly the kind of risk you want to take for the sake of a slightly better night’s sleep.",
        "I did hear that low-dose magnesium bisglycinate might be better tolerated. But rather than gambling with my health, I opted for the safer route – magnesium-rich foods. Every night before bed, I started eating a handful of nuts, seeds, or dark chocolate (because let’s be real, if I have to eat something for my health, I’d rather it be chocolate)."
