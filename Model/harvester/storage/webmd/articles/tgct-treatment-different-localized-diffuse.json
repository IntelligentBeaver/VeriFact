        "Tenosynovial giant tumors (TGCTs) are tumors that affect your joints. They are rare and usually benign. They aren’t cancerous. That said, even benign tumors can cause damage as they grow and put pressure on surrounding tissues. This is why you might need treatment. These tumors can be localized or diffuse. Localized TGCTs stay inside the joint as they grow. Most often, localized TGCTs only affect the smaller joints, like those in your hand. Some doctors may call localized TGCTs nodular TGCTs (N-TGCT) instead of localized. It’s the same thing, just a different name. Diffuse TGCTs are different from localized ones. They spread beyond the joint and they grow quickly. The most common joint affected by diffuse TGCTs is the knee, but they can occur in other joints too. Whether you have a localized or diffuse TGCT, your doctor might choose to do “active surveillance” or “watchful waiting” at first if you don't have symptoms. Active surveillance means that you won’t get any treatment. Instead, you will be watched closely, with regular tests, to check if the tumor grows. If it does grow and cause symptoms or start to cause damage to surrounding tissue, your doctor will likely then suggest treatment. Localized TGCTs and diffuse TGCTs are treated differently because of where they are (the joints) and the damage they can do."

        "Surgery is the most common treatment for both localized TGCTs and diffuse TGCTs. The procedure is to remove the tumor as well as any damaged joint lining. If needed, the surgeon also repairs damage to your tendons and ligaments. Surgery for localized tumors is fairly effective – only about 10% to 15% of the tumors recur (come back) after the tumor is removed. Unfortunately, diffuse TGCT surgery isn’t as successful because 50% to 70% of these tumors recur. And as many as 88% of these tumors come back after repeat surgery. Types of TGCT surgery Arthroscopy Since localized TGCT is limited to inside the joint, an orthopedic surgeon might choose to do arthroscopic surgery. It can also be done for diffuse TGCT in some cases. An arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgery because the surgeon makes very small incisions instead of a big one. One tiny incision is for a camera that sends images to a screen. This allows the surgeon to see inside the joint. The other incisions are for special tools used to remove the tumor."
