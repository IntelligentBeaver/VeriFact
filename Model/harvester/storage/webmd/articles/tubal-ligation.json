        "Tubal ligation, also known as having your tubes tied, is a kind of surgery that will stop you from ever being able to get pregnant . If you’re thinking about having it done, it's important to understand the procedure and its advantages and disadvantages before making a decision.",
        "“Tubal” refers to your fallopian tubes, and “ligation” means to tie off. Fallopian tubes are thin tubes that connect each of your ovaries to your uterus (womb). They are also called ovarian tubes. They’re passageways for unfertilized eggs. In a tubal ligation, you’ll have surgery to cut or block your fallopian tubes. That way, the eggs released by your ovary each cycle can't meet up and be fertilized by sperm .",

        "Tubal ligation is a surgery that blocks the tubes with a small cut, tie, clamp, or band. That way, eggs released from your ovaries can’t get through to your uterus to implant. They also can’t meet up with sperm and become fertilized. Tubal ligation is also called sterilization because it makes it impossible to get pregnant from sexual activity. Tubal ligation lasts forever."
