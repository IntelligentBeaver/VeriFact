        "It's hard to get through a year without getting a cold. That's because it spreads very easily. You might get the cold virus from someone sneezing or coughing and releasing droplets in the air near you. Or you might get it from touching a person with a cold or handling an object they touched and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. About 200 different viruses can spread the common cold, which makes it hard to create a vaccine for it. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus.",

If your doctor suspects strep throat, they will take a culture and determine if you have an infection and may need antibiotics. If they suspect pneumonia, you will need a chest X-ray. Coughing, sneezing, and a sore throat should go away within 1-2 weeks. If it's longer than that, see your doctor."

Some people swear that taking large doses of vitamin C or supplements containing vitamin C, zinc, echinacea, and other herbs and minerals will stop a cold or shorten it. Studies are mixed on whether these nutrients make a difference; in the studies where they did show benefits, they shortened colds only by a day or two. Still, if you want to try, it can't hurt. Just make sure you do your megadosing at the first sign of a throat tickle or when you've been around someone who's been sneezing but before you have symptoms."

        "Colds have multiple symptoms, so you usually need multiple products for treatment. You might need an antihistamine to dry up your runny nose, a pain reliever for your headache and body aches, and a cough medicine for your cough. Be careful with taking multisymptom cold medicines, especially if you're using, say, a pain reliever at the same time. You don't want to overdose on all those drugs. Ease your sore throat by gargling with warm salt water. Get plenty of rest, drink plenty of water, and have some chicken soup. The steam clears your nostrils, while the liquid provides hydration and has a lot of nutrition."
