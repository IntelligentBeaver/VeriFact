        "Some treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) help ease day-to-day symptoms, while others can help control an attack (relapse). Other medicines are designed to limit further damage to the nervous system. Medicines that can slow the progression , or worsening, of MS are known as disease-modifying treatments, or DMTs for short.",
        "DMTs cannot cure the disease, but they can slow it. Over time, this means fewer relapses and more delayed progression than if the disease were left untreated.",
        "Many DMT options are available, including pills, injections, and intravenous infusions. There is no single option that works best for everyone because each person’s MS may respond differently. When choosing a treatment, you and your health care provider will consider factors such as how active the disease is, possible risks and side effects, other medical conditions, and your preferences.",
        "One DMT for treating relapsing forms of MS is called Mayzent (siponimod) . The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Mayzent in 2019. It’s a once-daily tablet that you take by mouth, which some people may find easier or more convenient than medicines that are given by injection.",

People aged 18-60 years could enter the study if they had not had a relapse in the past three months before joining. They also needed to have moderate to advanced disability, measured using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). The EDSS is a scale that ranges from 0 to 10, where higher numbers mean more disability. To qualify, patients needed an EDSS score between 3.0 and 6.5 at the screening visit. A score of 3.0 reflects moderate disability in one major function or mild disability in several areas, whereas a score of 6.5 means you need two-sided assistance (such as a walker) to walk at least 20 meters.",
