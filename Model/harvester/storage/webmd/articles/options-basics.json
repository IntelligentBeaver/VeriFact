        "Osteo arthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. If your fingers, hips, knees, or other joints feel painful when you use them, you might have this condition. Doctors sometimes call it degenerative bone disease. Experts estimate more than 80% of people over 55 have some degree of it. About 60% of those have noticeable symptoms.",
        "With OA, your joints swell from wear and tear, and your cartilage (a rubbery tissue covering the ends of your bones) breaks down over time, leaving your bones without anything to cushion them. This causes them to rub against each other. Your joints get inflamed and cause chronic pain.",
        "Your joint pain and stiffness may become so severe that you find daily tasks difficult or impossible. You have a higher risk of depression and sleep disturbances, due to ongoing pain and increasing mobility problems. There's no cure for OA, but there are combinations of treatments to help ease your symptoms.",
