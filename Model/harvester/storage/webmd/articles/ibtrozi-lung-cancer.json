        "Ibtrozi is a medicine called a kinase inhibitor that is used to treat a certain type of lung cancer called non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is caused by an abnormal ROS1 gene. NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, but ROS1-positive NSCLC happens in less than 2% of people with NSCLC. Ibtrozi is a non-chemotherapy treatment that works by targeting and blocking ROS1 markers on NSCLC cells."
