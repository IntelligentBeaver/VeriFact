        "Imagine feeling guilty about resting. That was my experience adjusting to life with a chronic illness.",
        "Before my myasthenia gravis (MG) diagnosis, I stayed in a constant state of productivity. When my body couldn’t keep that same pace, I was devastated. I felt guilty about taking a nap. It was as though I believed the world would fall apart if I took 30 minutes to rest. It wasn’t until later in my journey that I discovered napping isn’t a luxury, but a crucial component of managing a chronic illness.",

        "There are several benefits to napping when you have a chronic illness. For starters, naps are great for energy restoration. Both physical and mental energy can be replenished when you nap. You can improve your focus and mental clarity to help with brain fog.",
        "Pain management is another benefit. Engaging in naps can cause muscle relaxation and reduce your overall discomfort. There are also mental health and mood benefits. Napping can lower your stress levels, which positively impacts your illness symptoms."
