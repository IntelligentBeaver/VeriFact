        "That’s according to a new report from the United Hospital Fund , an independent nonprofit group that aims to improve health care for New Yorkers. The report rounds up the latest statistics on adolescent mental health, both in New York and across the country. While these numbers date from 2022, at the height of the pandemic , the report shows clearly that the sharp drop in youth mental health began 10 years earlier, long before COVID-19 hit our shores.",
        "In 2022, 6.7 million U.S. adolescents had one or more behavioral health conditions, and the the total number of them with those conditions skyrocketed from 2011 to 2021. During that decade, for example, the number of adolescents per 100,000 who had a major depressive episode, or MDE, soared from 8,063 in 2011 to 19,863 in 2021 – an increase of nearly 150%. While the growth in clinically diagnosed depression was smaller, it rose by 7% per year, on average, from 2016 to 2022."

        "In Haidt’s book, he points to another factor that predated social media. This is the trend that started in the 1990s of many parents restricting the freedom of their children out of concern for their safety. Haidt argues that by not allowing their kids to go out and play with their friends, and even engage in some kinds of unsupervised, risky play, these parents have inhibited normal social development, which can lead to depression and anxiety.",
        "“The lack of free time and play for kids and the reduction in child independence are very important,” Piacentini said. “The things that our generation did as kids are incorrectly perceived as unsafe. The child whose feet never touch the ground never learns how to walk. So I agree with Haidt, and he’s saying what a lot of other people are thinking and researching.”",
        "Why are girls affected so much more than boys? Gurwitch noted that there has always been a gender difference in mental health challenges. Not only do girls tend to internalize feelings of depression and anxiety more than boys do, she said, but boys are less likely to express their feelings."
