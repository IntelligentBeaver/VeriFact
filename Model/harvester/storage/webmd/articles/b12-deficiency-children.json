        "Children need vitamins including B12 to help their brains and bodies develop and grow. Not getting enough vitamin B12, which is also called cobalamin, can make children feel weak and tired and slow down their growth and development. If left untreated, this deficiency in B12 can lead to rare but serious concerns including brain damage, nerve damage, and other health issues. When a vitamin deficiency is caught and treated early, most children recover and thrive. Here’s what you need to know about vitamin B12, the symptoms that your child is not getting enough, when it’s time to talk to your child’s pediatrician , and how a vitamin B12 deficiency can be treated."

People who have stomach surgery may also have trouble absorbing the vitamin. Children who eat little or no dairy or meat – such as those following strict vegan or vegetarian diets – may not get enough of the vitamin from their diet and require a vitamin supplement. Babies can develop low levels of B12 if their mothers had low vitamin levels during pregnancy . During pregnancy, a fetus collects and stores vitamin B12, which their bodies use for the first few months of life.
