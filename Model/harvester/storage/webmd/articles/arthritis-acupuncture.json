        "Acupuncture is a treatment that comes from traditional Chinese medicine . During an acupuncture session, your practitioner inserts very fine stainless steel needles into your skin to treat health problems. Traditional acupuncture aims to open up your flow of Qi (pronounced chee). Qi is thought to be energy that flows along your body's 14 major energy-carrying channels, or “meridians.” Traditional acupuncturists believe that blocks in Qi cause illness in your body. And they believe that unblocking this flow of Qi can treat and cure illnesses.",
