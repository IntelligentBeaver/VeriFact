        "Tooth enamel erosion is when the protective enamel on your teeth wears away, causing it to become thinner and weaker than it should be. This makes your teeth more likely to get stained and feel sensitive to hot or cold. The erosion and thinning of your tooth enamel also make you more likely to have cavities. Many things can lead to tooth enamel erosion, and some people are more prone to it than others.",

        "Most of the time, tooth erosion happens over time. But there are some things you can do to slow or stop it. Once you've lost enamel, there's no way to make it grow back. So, it's a good idea to take steps to protect your teeth before your enamel erodes. To start, brush and floss regularly and see your dentist for routine cleanings and checkups."

        "\"Tooth enamel is the hard tissue covering your teeth,\" says Ada Cooper, DDS, a practicing dentist in New York City and consumer advisor spokesperson for the American Dental Association. \"It, in fact, is the hardest substance in the body, and it serves as a protective layer. It is composed of 96% minerals, which is the highest percent of any tissue in your body, making it durable and damage-resistant, but not damage-proof.\"",
        "Because your tooth enamel doesn't have living cells, there's no way to repair damage to your enamel from erosion or decay, Cooper says. Your enamel can also get stained if you drink cola, tea, red wine, or other dark beverages."
