        "If you have had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), you may worry about having another life-threatening clot. People who’ve had a DVT and can’t take blood-thinning medications have another option to prevent pulmonary embolism (PE) from recurring clots. This is surgical placement of an inferior vena cava filter.",
        "An inferior vena cava filter is a small device placed inside a vein called the inferior vena cava. A doctor uses a thin catheter that is inserted into your neck or groin to put the filter in place. This device can stop DVT clots from moving through the inferior vena cava into your lung, where they can cause a pulmonary embolism. PEs can be very serious, leading to pain, severe shortness of breath, or even death. IVC filters can help prevent PEs and save your life."
