        "The MTHFR gene mutation is a variation in the MTHFR gene. This gene normally tells your body how to make the MTHFR protein. You need this protein to process folate, which helps your body make DNA.",
        "You have two copies of the MTHFR gene — one from your mother and one from your father. These genes tell your body how to make the MTHFR protein, which you need to produce folate, a B vitamin. Folate is required to break down homocysteine, an amino acid. If you have an MTHFR gene mutation, your body may not break down folate as well as it should. This leads to increased levels of homocysteine, which potentially could cause health problems.",
