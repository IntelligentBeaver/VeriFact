        "Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia in older people. Dementia is a group of conditions that affects brain functions such as thinking, memory, and reasoning. Vascular dementia happens when the brain’s blood vessels become damaged, narrowed, or blocked, preventing blood from reaching the brain properly. This disruption causes brain tissue damage, and your brain stops working well.",
        "Because it's less well-known than Alzheimer's, many people don't think of vascular dementia if their forgetfulness becomes problematic. It's also difficult to diagnose, so it's hard to know precisely how many people have vascular dementia. Current estimates suggest that 15%-20% of dementia cases in older adults are due to vascular dementia.",
