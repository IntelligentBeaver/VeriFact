        "Inlexzo is a new treatment for a type of bladder cancer in adults that hasn’t spread to the muscles and doesn’t respond to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy. It’s approved for treating non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ that may or may not have small growths (papillary tumors).",
        "Health care providers often recommend radical cystectomy (surgical removal of the bladder) in patients who don’t get help from BCG therapy. But it is a major surgery with serious side effects that can affect quality of life and carries a risk for death after surgery. As NMIBC mainly affects older adults, many may not be fit or willing to have their bladder removed.",
        "What makes Inlexzo unique is how it delivers the medicine. It uses a small device that slowly releases gemcitabine, a cancer-fighting drug, directly into your bladder over time (extended release). Gemcitabine works by stopping cancer cells from making new DNA, preventing their growth and spread. The device stays inside the bladder for three weeks, giving the medicine more time to work where it’s needed most.",
        "Although gemcitabine has been given directly into the bladder for many years, this is the first and only system approved to deliver a bladder cancer drug in this way and may offer a new option for people who can’t have or choose not to have their bladder removed."

        "Inlexzo was approved because it showed promising and long-lasting results in studies involving adults with NMIBC that didn’t get help from BCG treatment.",
        "In a study, 82% of people who had received Inlexzo every three weeks for six months, followed by once every month for up to 18 months, showed a complete response, meaning no signs of cancer were found during follow-up tests. About half (51%) of those who saw a response stayed cancer-free for at least a year. Most people in the study were older adults, including many who were 65 or older.",
        "However, this treatment isn’t suitable for everyone as a small number of people developed more serious cancer after delaying their bladder removal surgery.",
        "The most common side effects reported in the study were urinary problems, such as feeling a strong urge to urinate or needing to urinate often, pain while urinating, urinary tract infections, blood in urine, and bladder irritation. Some blood test results changed, such as levels of certain blood cells and substances in the blood, like hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and liver enzymes, were also common. About 1 in 4 people had serious side effects, and a few had to stop treatment early."
