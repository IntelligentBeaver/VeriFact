  "meta_description": "Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is a group of cancers that affect your lymphocytes -- notably, the B-cells and T-cells in your lymph nodes. NHLs may grow slowly (indolent lymphomas) or quickly (aggressive lymphomas). B-cell lymphomas are the most common type of NHL. Symptoms include swollen lymph nodes, night sweats, fatigue, itching, and more. Treatments range from chemotherapy to stem cell transplant.",
