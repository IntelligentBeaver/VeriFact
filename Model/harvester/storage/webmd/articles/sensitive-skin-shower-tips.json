A shower can feel great while you’re in it, but spending too much time under the jets can trigger skin troubles later. “Staying in too long washes the oils away from your skin,” says Carolyn Goh, MD, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.",

The same goes for baths, even though they’re a soak and not a spray. “The amount of time you spend in the water is more important than how the water touches your skin,” she says."

        "Sensitive skin and soap aren’t great friends, so the less you lather up, the better. If you can’t see dirt, water will do for cleaning most of your body. “Keep the soap to the dirty areas -- armpits and groin ,” says Suzan Obagi, MD, director of the Cosmetic Surgery & Skin Health Center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “Harsh soaps can dry your skin out more and make sensitive skin worse.”",
        "Cool it down . Hot water also strips away your skin’s natural oils. There’s no ideal temperature to shoot for, Obagi says. Lukewarm -- not too hot and not too cold -- is the most soothing. Find the coolest temperature you can stand and leave it there. Speedy showers help here too, she says, because people tend to turn the temperature up the longer they’re in.",
        "Pick the right products. Watch out for harsh soaps or body washes that have fragrance, dyes, or are deodorizing. Avoid alcohol-based and antibacterial options. All these are more likely to irritate your skin and leave it itchy, tight, and dry. Instead, go for gentle cleansers or shower gels with added oils or fats. “Look for soaps and cleansers that say ‘moisturizing,’ ‘hypoallergenic,’ or ‘made for sensitive skin,’ ” Obagi says."
