The syndrome may be linked to brain lesions (such as those found in dementia and Parkinson’s disease), substance abuse, metabolic conditions, or nutrient deficiencies. These factors disrupt your ability to feel an emotional connection to a face you know and love. Treatment typically involves medications such as dementia drugs, antipsychotics, and antidepressants, along with different types of therapies.
