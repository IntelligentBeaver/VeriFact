        "When Eric Huddleston gets home from work each day, if it’s pollen season, he leaves most of his clothes on the front porch before going inside and heading straight for the shower. But that just reduces his exposure to one allergen. Once he’s inside, Huddleston has to face dust and the rescue cat that lives in the basement. “It’s worse in the spring in pollen season, but I have fall allergies, too, and the cat and dust allergies are year-round,” Huddleston says. “So it’s like you’re chronically sick.” For those who don’t live with seasonal allergies, it may seem like a runny nose and itchy, watery eyes would be no big deal, but “even if it’s just these two symptoms, it’s going to affect your concentration, your ability to work, your sleep, and your overall quality of life,” says Deepti Manian, MD, an allergist and immunologist in Topeka, Kansas."

When congestion goes on for too long, it can lead to sinus infections (sinusitis) and ear infections. “Everything in our head is interconnected,” Manian says. “The sinuses drain into the nose, the eyes drain into the nose, the ears drain into the nose, and it all goes down to the throat.” Ear and sinus infections were old hat for Nicole Levin, who teaches English as a second language at an elementary school in New York City. “Before I started doing the double antihistamines that my doctor recommended, it was always sinus infections and ear infections.” She goes to the ear, nose, and throat specialist to have her sinuses and ears drained every three weeks during allergy season. “It helps a lot. Before that, I was really suffering.”"

        "“I tell patients to start the nasal spray before allergy season begins, like around Valentine’s Day, because they reach maximum efficacy after about two weeks of use,” Patel says. Finally, if over-the-counter meds don’t offer enough relief, it’s time to see a doctor. “If you’re taking medicine and it’s not helping or allergies are still affecting your day-to-day life, I would recommend you see an allergist,” Patel says. Doctors can prescribe allergy medications that may be stronger and more effective than what you can pick up on your own at the drugstore. For people whose allergy symptoms are not well controlled enough by these medications, doctors may recommend allergy shots. Also known as allergen immunotherapy injections, each shot contains a tiny amount of the offending allergen. When it enters your system, it teaches your immune system to stop having its typical outsized reaction to the substance. But it takes a while to retrain the immune system. You must get the shots once or twice a week for the first six months and then monthly for a total of three to five years."
