When the blood vessels that bring oxygen to the skin become narrow, changes can happen, such as hair loss and thinning, shiny skin (especially on the shins), thickened and discolored toenails, and cold skin. Because blood carries the white blood cells that help fight infection, your legs and feet can heal more slowly when they are injured.",

Firm, yellow, waxy pea-like bumps on the skin are surrounded by red halos and are itchy. These usually show up on the eyes, elbows, face, and buttocks. They also can appear on the back side of the arms and legs. To treat it, your doctor will work to control the level of fats in your blood. The bumps usually go away over several weeks. You might also need drugs that control different types of fats in the blood (lipid-lowering drugs)."
