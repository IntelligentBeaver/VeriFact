Staying out of the sun or using a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher when outdoors is the best way to prevent skin cancer of all types."

But that's not true, as he found in his 20s, when he was first treated for skin cancer. That early experience left him unsettled. \"The first time was a shock. I didn't understand it,\" he recalls. \"And I realized there are a lot of people like me who had been misled and were at risk.\"",
        "When his dermatologist discovered five suspicious moles last year and told him he would need surgery, he decided to use the opportunity to teach people about the dangers of skin cancer and the importance of protecting themselves. \"I said, ‘Let's do this live,'\" recalls Champion, who spends his time in the sun very safely these days.",
        "\"I used to be like George Hamilton -- always at the beach, always tan,\" he says. \"Now, going to the beach, getting on a boat, I use a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher every single time. I don't mess with that.\""
