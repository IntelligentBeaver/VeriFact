Insulin glargine works by giving your body more insulin. Insulin works to move sugar from the blood into your cells and stops your liver from producing sugar. Lixisenatide helps to stimulate your pancreas to make more insulin, prevents your liver from releasing stored sugars, and slows down the movement of food through your body."
