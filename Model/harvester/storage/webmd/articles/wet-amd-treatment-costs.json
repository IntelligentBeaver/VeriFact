Treatments for wet AMD can help to preserve your eyesight. Their costs can range up to tens of thousands of dollars per year, depending on which treatment you get and your health insurance coverage.

For this treatment, your doctor injects medicine into your eyeball with a very small needle. These eye injections usually involve a type of medicine called anti-VEGF, or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. It stops the growth of blood vessels that threaten your eyesight. Aflibercept (Eylea ), bevacizumab (Avastin ), brolucizumab (Beovu), and ranibizumab (Lucentis ) are anti-VEGF drugs used to treat wet AMD. Another drug, faricimab-svoa (Vabysmo ), also stops a second protein involved in forming blood vessels called angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2)."

        "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is another way to treat wet AMD. In this procedure, your doctor injects you with a medication that’s sensitive to light. The drug circulates throughout your body and reaches the blood vessels that are leaking fluid in your eye. Your doctor then numbs your eye with eyedrops. With the help of a special contact lens, they aim a laser beam at the harmful blood vessels. The light-sensitive medicine causes blood clots to form and seals off the blood vessels. Eye injections largely replaced photodynamic therapy as a wet AMD treatment in 2006. But you may still get photodynamic therapy alongside eye injections. You could also have it if the shots don't work well to treat your wet AMD. It's not common, but doctors can also do an even older laser procedure called photocoagulation therapy, or \"hot\" laser surgery. It works similarly to photodynamic therapy, but the laser itself burns and seals the blood vessels, rather than the medication. It's not suitable for many people with wet AMD."

        "Most types of insurance cover treatments for wet AMD, but how much you pay out of pocket can vary widely. Keep in mind that, in addition to medication costs, you'll need to cover copays for doctor visits and any deductibles you have. You might need eye injections as often as once a month. And you may have to keep getting them for years, perhaps indefinitely. It's a good idea to call your insurer before you start treatment so you'll know how much you can expect to pay. Aflibercept (Eylea). The FDA approved aflibercept to treat AMD in 2011. Its retail (before insurance) price is about $1,850-$2,000 a dose. Bevacizumab (Avastin). This is a widely used and cost-effective drug for wet AMD injections. The FDA approved it to treat colon cancer in 2004. (It works by stopping the growth of new blood vessels.) But ophthalmologists regularly use the drug for off-label treatment of wet AMD. One dose costs around $55 retail, though you'll probably pay less if your insurance covers it."

Faricimab-svoa (Vabysmo). This newer drug, approved for wet AMD in 2022, lasts longer than many anti-VGEF medications. You can go around 3 months between Vabysmo injections. One study found about half of those who took it could go 4 months between shots. Its retail price is about $2,300 per dose. Photodynamic therapy (PDT). The pre-insurance cost is around $2,500 for the medication, doctor’s fee, and imaging. You may need four PDT therapy treatments in the eye with wet AMD across a 3-year time span.
