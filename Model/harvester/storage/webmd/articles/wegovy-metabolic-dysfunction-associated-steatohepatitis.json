        "Fatty liver disease happens when too much fat builds up in the liver. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a severe type of fatty liver disease where fat buildup causes liver scarring and inflammation.",
        "MASH is the new name for this condition. The old name was nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) because it does not result from alcohol use. Instead, MASH results from problems with how your body processes nutrients (metabolic dysfunction) and is associated with conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol .",
        "Many people can manage MASH with healthy lifestyle changes. If it is not managed, MASH can lead to stiffening and scarring in the liver (fibrosis) and eventually progress to permanent liver damage (cirrhosis) or liver failure . MASH may not cause any symptoms, but doctors can do tests to check for inflammation and other signs of fatty liver disease.",
        "If you have fatty liver disease, you may be considering treatment options. One medicine you might hear about is Wegovy (semaglutide) . The FDA approved it for certain people with MASH in August 2025."
