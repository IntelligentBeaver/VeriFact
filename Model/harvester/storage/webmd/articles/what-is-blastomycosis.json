        "Blastomycosis — also known as blasto, North American blastomycosis, or Gilchrist disease — is a rare infection caused by breathing in a fungus called blastomyces. It usually affects the lungs but can spread to other parts of your body, such as your skin , joints, and bones.",
        "The fungus that causes blastomycosis lives outdoors in soil, leaves, and rotting wood, especially in areas near water. It is a mold that creates spores. If you disturb the ground where blastomyces is growing, it can release spores into the air. You might breathe these in without knowing it, as they’re too small to see. Pneumonia-like symptoms usually appear later if you have an infection.",
        "Blastomyces, while rare, is most commonly found in North America, especially in the Midwestern states, with hotspots in Wisconsin and Minnesota. It’s also found in South Central and Southeastern U.S., as well as in Southeastern Canada. Blastomyces has also been reported in India and parts of the Middle East and Africa."
