        "Nicotine creates a chemical dependency so that the body develops a need for a certain level of nicotine at all times. Unless that level is maintained -- by smoking or chewing tobacco -- your body will begin to go through withdrawal. So, when you stop, your body goes through a very uncomfortable, but short-lived withdrawal process. This is why nicotine replacement (with gum, lozenges, patches) is helpful for people trying to quit cigarettes -- it reduces these unpleasant feelings.",
        "Going through nicotine withdrawal can be tough. Because smoking affects so many parts of your body, nicotine withdrawal involves physical, mental, emotional, and behavioral symptoms, including irritability, insomnia, anxiety , and increased appetite.",
        "You’ll have intense cravings for a cigarette. You’ll be angry, irritable, and restless. You’ll have headaches and a cough. You’ll be tired but won’t be able to sleep.",
        "But hang in there! Most withdrawal symptoms peak 48 hours after you quit and subside over the next 3 to 4 weeks."
