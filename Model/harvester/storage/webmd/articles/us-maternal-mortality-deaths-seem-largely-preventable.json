The seriousness of heart failure is measured by the ejection fraction, or the percentage of blood the heart pumps out. Normal is 50%-70%. Hutchinson’s ejection fraction was 20%.",
        "She was put on medication, left the hospital after 5 days, and her ejection fraction eventually rose to 35%. But she was still at risk for sudden cardiac death."
