It has a rich, complex flavor, with a distinct nuttiness and a hint of sweetness from the anthocyanin pigments.",

Historical evidence shows that cultivated rice first appeared in China and spread to other regions across Asia. This cultivated rice came in a range of colors, including red, brown, white, and black due to natural changes in the rice grain's outer layer. Wild rice was only one color: red.",

Black rice was favored for its rich taste, and it quickly became a special food for wealthier groups. This is how black rice earned one of its names — forbidden rice. There was a time in China's history that black rice was forbidden to all who weren't noble or royalty."
