        "Singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow is in a good place. Yes, she’s back on her              farm just outside of Nashville, Tenn., close to family and friends again after              keeping a demanding winter schedule that took her across the country and to              Japan. The rock-country crooner, 47, promoted two albums ( Detours and Home for Christmas ), made the rounds of chat shows, and performed for              the new First Family in HBO’s “We Are One” concert at the Lincoln Memorial in              Washington, D.C. (No slacker, she played a few inaugural balls there, too.) She              was also a presenter at the 2009 Grammy Awards in Los Angeles in February.              Nine-time winner Crow’s Detours was nominated for Best Pop Vocal              Album.",
        "But simple geography -- the slower, familiar pace below the Mason-Dixon Line              -- is not the only thing making this Kennett, Mo., native smile. The good place              Crow is enjoying right now is coming from within.",
        "“I’m not nearly so hard on myself anymore,” she tells WebMD. “I’ve learned              to stop putting everybody before myself, and to say ‘no’ sometimes, which was a              huge lesson for me. I think women get caught up in that, forgetting about their              own needs.” Even with the international, bicoastal itinerary she’s just              wrapped, Crow claims she does “only what I want to do” these days, and that              “for every 10 requests I get now, I might say ‘yes’ to one.”"

That means for mothers,              partners, and kids. “We live a lot longer these days,” says Adams. “Not only is              it important for both mothers and fathers to foster healthy independence in              their kids at a very young age, it’s essential for women to look beyond their              marriages, too. … If women solely see their role as ‘mom,’ they will have              difficult years ahead after their children leave the home. Women and their              husbands need to have other things going on outside of the marriage.”",
