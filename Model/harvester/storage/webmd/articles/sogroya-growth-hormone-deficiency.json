        "Sogroya is a long-acting form of somatropin. Somatropin is also called human growth hormone . Sogroya is made by attaching human growth hormone to a small protein that helps it stay in the body longer by slowing down how quickly it is broken down. This design allows the growth hormone in Sogroya to keep working throughout the week, so it only needs to be injected once each week. Some other somatropin medicines need to be injected every day."

Children with GHD may have shorter height or delayed puberty, and this medicine can help their bodies grow and mature. In adults with GHD, somatropin helps improve body composition ."
