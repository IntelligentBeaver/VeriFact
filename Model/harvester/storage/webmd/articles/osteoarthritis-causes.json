        "Primary osteoarthritis is caused by the breakdown of cartilage, a rubbery material that eases the friction in your joints. It can happen in any joint but usually affects your fingers, thumbs, spine, hips, knees, or big toes.",
        "Osteoarthritis is more common in older people. Using your joints over and over damages the cartilage, leading to pain and swelling. Water builds up in the cartilage, and its proteins break down. It may start to flake or get tiny tears. In severe cases, you can lose all the cartilage between the bones of a joint so that they rub together, making it harder and more painful to use the joint.",
        "Cartilage damage can also trigger bone growths (spurs) around your joints.",
        "Osteoarthritis sometimes happens in multiple members of one family, hinting that a gene change has been handed down from parents to children. Rarely, these cases are caused by problems in collagen, a tough protein found in your connective tissue."
