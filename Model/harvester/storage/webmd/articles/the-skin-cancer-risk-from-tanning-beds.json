        "In fact, I got my first tan when I went to Florida in 2001. I was 17 years old, and I was really excited about how I looked. When I returned home, I started going to a tanning salon to keep up the color. Over the next two and a half years I returned once a week. I wasn’t super dark; I was just tan for my complexion. I thought it was OK because a nurse friend told my family that a tanning bed doesn’t cause skin cancer the way sunlight does. I learned she was wrong when I developed skin cancer."
