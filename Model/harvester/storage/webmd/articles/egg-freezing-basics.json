Once you're ready to get pregnant, the fertility clinic thaws your eggs so they can be fertilized with sperm from your partner or a donor. The egg freezing process has been around for a long time. The first birth using a frozen egg was in 1986. Thanks to new techniques, success rates have improved since then and the option has become more widely available."

You give yourself injections of fertility hormones to help more eggs mature in your ovaries. Your doctor does blood tests and vaginal ultrasounds to see whether your eggs are ready. Once the eggs are ready, you get a trigger shot — a different medicine to make them fully mature. About a day later, your doctor does a procedure in the office to retrieve the eggs. You'll get medicine to make you sleepy and prevent pain. Using an ultrasound for guidance, your doctor places a needle through your vagina into your ovary and gently suctions out mature eggs. The procedure takes less than 10 minutes. You may stay in the doctor's office for an hour afterward to recover before going home. Your eggs then go to a lab, where a specialist checks them under a microscope to see which ones are ready to be fertilized. The most mature eggs go into an incubator. Your doctor may recommend doing more than one retrieval cycle if you are older or you don't have a lot of ovarian reserve."

Once thawed, the eggs are ready to be fertilized with sperm. Often this involves a procedure called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). ICSI injects sperm into an egg in a lab to create an embryo.",

Your odds of success may depend on: Your age when you freeze your eggs The quality of the frozen eggs The number of eggs that are frozen In a large study published in 2022, researchers reported that 70% of women who froze eggs when they were younger than 38 – and thawed at least 20 eggs – had a baby. Embryo freezing has slightly higher success rates. But you must have a partner or sperm donor to make and freeze embryos."
