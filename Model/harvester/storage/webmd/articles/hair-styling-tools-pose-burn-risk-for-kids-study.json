        "Oct. 24, 2023 – For parents and caregivers, stovetops and lit candles are among the most common red flags for burn injury risk, especially in young children. Yet there is another culprit lurking on bathroom and vanity counters that might escape notice: hair care or styling tools.",
        "A study presented this past weekend at the American Academy of Pediatrics annual meeting underscored the growing risk from hair styling tools among children and adolescents. Findings showed that between 2013 and 2022, there were more than 30,000 burn injuries and over 1,000 visits to emergency departments for care. What’s more, roughly 68% of these injuries were to children under the age of 10, and almost three-quarters happened in the home.",
        "“When you think about it, it’s developmentally appropriate to have high curiosity in the younger age, as they haven’t quite learned the hazards surrounding certain things. A curling iron , for example, is one that could be left to cool on the counter, potentially leading them to reach for it,” said lead study author Brandon Rozanski MD, a pediatric resident at Tripler Army Medical Center in Honolulu, HI."
