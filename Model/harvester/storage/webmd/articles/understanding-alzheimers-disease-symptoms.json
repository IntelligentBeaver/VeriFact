        "Alzheimer's is a brain disease that causes a decline in your memory, thinking, reasoning, and organization skills. It eventually impairs your ability to do daily basic tasks. The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease often come on slowly over several years. There are different symptoms at each stage of the condition.",
        "Alzheimer's is one form of dementia. Dementia is a broad term to describe a decline in mental function, and Alzheimer’s is a specific disease underneath that umbrella. Different types of dementia can have similar symptoms, and it’s also possible to have more than one type at a time, so it can be hard to know if what you have is Alzheimer’s.",
