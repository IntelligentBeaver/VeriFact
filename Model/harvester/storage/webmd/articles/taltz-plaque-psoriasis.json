        "Plaque psoriasis , the most common form of psoriasis, is a type of autoimmune condition where the body’s immune cells attack its own healthy cells. In people with plaque psoriasis, the immune system attacks healthy skin cells, which causes swelling ( inflammation ). This can make too many skin cells form on the skin, causing discolored patches. These patches, which are known as “plaques,” are sections of thick, raised skin that may be covered with a thin, silvery-white scale."

        "For plaque psoriasis in adults, three studies known as UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2, and UNCOVER-3 were completed to see if Taltz was better than a placebo (containing no medicine) at reducing the severity of psoriasis after 12 weeks. In UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3, Taltz was also compared to another medicine that treats psoriasis, etanercept (Enbrel). People in these studies were between 32 and 58 years old, with plaque psoriasis involving at least 10% of body surface area, and moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (about 50% had severe or very severe disease). Of the people in the studies, 44% had prior light therapy, 49% had tried by-mouth medicines, and 26% had tried an injection medicine for psoriasis.  Twenty-three percent had a history of psoriatic arthritis .",
        "Taltz was better than placebo in all three studies, with up to 90% of people treated with Taltz seeing a 75% improvement of psoriasis plaques and about 40% of people treated with Taltz having completely clear skin at week 12. In comparison, only 2% to 7% of people treated with placebo saw a 75% improvement of psoriasis plaques, and 0% to 1% of people treated with a placebo noted completely clear skin at week 12. An extension of the study showed that these results continued to be seen for up to 60 weeks, with at least 50% of people maintaining or achieving complete clearance of their psoriasis. Taltz was also better than etanercept at reducing psoriasis plaque severity and achieving clearer skin after 12 weeks."

Children in the study had moderate to severe plaque psoriasis involving at least 10% of their body surface area.

The main purpose of the study was to see if Taltz was better than placebo at improving psoriasis  in children and adolescents, as measured by a 75% improvement of the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) severity score and a separate score showing their psoriasis as clear or almost clear at week 12. In this study, 89% of children who used Taltz saw a 75% improvement of psoriasis plaques at 12 weeks compared to 25% who used a placebo medicine, and 81% of children using Taltz achieved a score indicating clear or almost clear disease compared to 11% using a placebo medicine.
