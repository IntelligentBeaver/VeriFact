        "Sept. 18, 2025 -- About 1 in 8 men will face a prostate cancer diagnosis. Early-stage prostate cancer often has no symptoms—so how should men approach screening and advocacy? What disparities do Black men experience that would negatively impact their outcomes? And what can we do about it? We spoke with Otis Brawley, MD , professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins, about the types of prostate cancer, key symptoms, when and how often to screen, and why access to equal treatment is essential for equal outcomes for Black men. He also explains metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and why advanced imaging like PSMA PET scans matters. Survivor David Diaz Sr ., executive director of The Reluctant Brotherhood , also shares his story of diagnosis, treatment, and the power of support groups for men navigating prostate cancer."

I got tested and found out my PSA was elevated, was recommended for a prostatectomy, found out my cancer had spread to my pelvic bone, and from there, life just changed.",

About one in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime, and the risk increases with age, though certain populations, including Black men, face higher incidence and mortality rates.",
        "Pathak: In its early stages, prostate cancer may cause no obvious symptoms. When symptoms do appear, they usually are because of the spread of the cancer, and some of these symptoms can include changes in urination, pelvic discomfort, erectile dysfunction, and bone pain. Screening tools like the PSA blood test help doctors detect prostate cancer, and advanced imaging like PSMA PET scans can help with the management of advanced prostate cancer."

What disparities do Black men experience that would negatively impact their outcomes? And what can we do about it? We spoke with Otis Brawley, MD, professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins, about the types of prostate cancer, key symptoms, when and how often to screen, and why access to equal treatment is essential for equal outcomes for Black men. He also explains metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and why advanced imaging like PSMA PET scans matters. Survivor David Diaz Sr., executive director of The Reluctant Brotherhood, also shares his story of diagnosis, treatment, and the power of support groups for men navigating prostate cancer.",
