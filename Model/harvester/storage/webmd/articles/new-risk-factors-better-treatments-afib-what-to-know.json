        "May 4, 2023 – Did you know that atrial fibrillation – better known as AFib – is the most common type of heart rhythm disorder, and that by 2030, it’s estimated that about 12.1 million Americans will have it?",
        "The CDC estimates that over 454,000 people are hospitalized with AFib every year and that about 158,000 patients die annually from the disorder. If left untreated, AFib doubles your risk of heart-related death and increases your risk of stroke fivefold, according to the American Heart Association .",
        "With AFib, your heart will either beat too slowly, too quickly, or in an irregular pattern.",
        "“AFib originates from the heart’s upper chambers, mostly from the left atrium,” explained Jorge E. Romero, MD, director of arrhythmia and electrophysiology research and associate director of the ventricular arrhythmia program at Brigham and Women’s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center in Boston.",
        "“Blood won’t flow properly from those upper chambers to the lower chambers of your heart,\" which can result in short bouts of heart arrhythmia , or arrhythmia that becomes a permanent problem, said Romero, who is also a faculty member at Harvard Medical School."

        "Several newly discovered or little-known AFib risk factors are important to understand. Researchers recently found that the earlier or later a woman has menopause (before age 44 or at age 60 or older) is an important milestone that can increase AFib risk. This may be because irregular menstrual cycles are linked to heart disease risks such as glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. It could also be because menopause lowers estrogen, which can help protect against heart disease.",
        "A new study has also shed light on periodontal disease as an AFib risk. This kind of common gum infection may flood the body with inflammation, which can center on the heart. (Other research has suggested that inflammation can be a predictor for the development of AFib.)",
        "Being taller than 5-foot-7 may also add to AFib risk, because researchers think the left atrium of the heart being larger in taller people can increase the odds of its development. Doing a strenuous endurance sport, like cycling or cross-country skiing, can potentially enlarge the heart muscle, upping your potential AFib risk as well."

Advances in mapping catheters, signal processing, and cardiac imaging help us identify targets for ablation.”",

The traditional energy sources are radiofrequency, which relies on heating tissue, and cryoablation, which relies on the extreme cooling of tissue. More recently, pulse field ablation has emerged as a potentially safer strategy, using high-energy electric fields to create small, reversible pores selectively to heart muscle cells. This minimizes damaging adjacent parts of the body like the esophagus.”",
