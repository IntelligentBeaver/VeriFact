        "Rafael Nadal does not remember the first time he held a tennis racquet. He was too young -- 3 years old, maybe 4. But that racquet must have felt just right in his small hands. By age 5, he was a regular at the local tennis club in his hometown of Manaco,  on the Spanish island of Mallorca. Winning titles came almost as early.",
        "When he was 8 years old, he won a regional championship for players under 12, defeating boys who were three years older. By the time he turned 12, he had won both Spanish and European titles in his age group. Four years later, he was listed among the world's top 50 tennis players. In August 2008, at age 22, he was No. 1.",
        "Now 25, Nadal is No. 1 -- again -- having defeated his longtime rival Roger Federer last June to retake the top rank. Later that summer, he won the U.S. Open, earning himself a Career Grand Slam, meaning he's won each of tennis's four Grand Slam titles. He's the first player to do so since Federer achieved the distinction in 2009. (Grand Slams are the most important competitions in pro tennis. They are the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open.)"

But no matter the sport -- tennis, swimming, football, gymnastics -- it will take a toll on a child's body and mind. Laurel Blakemore, MD, chief of orthopaedic surgery and sports medicine at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C., offers a few tips to keep kids off the injured list and at the top of their game.",

Even if your child is focused on being the best at one sport, his body will benefit from branching out from time to time and giving other muscle groups a workout. \"It's physically difficult to always play a single sport,\" says Blakemore. \"Cross-training doesn't put the same amount of stress on the body. And mentally, it's good to mix things up. There's less burnout that way.\"If your kid is into soccer, suggest a season of track or basketball."
