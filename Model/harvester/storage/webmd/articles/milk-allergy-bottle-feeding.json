        "Babies should be fed exclusively breast milk or infant formula for the first 6 months of their lives, at which point you can start to introduce solid foods, though breast milk or formula should remain the main drink. If you are bottle-feeding your infant, and they have a cow's milk protein allergy, your doctor can recommend a hypoallergenic, cow’s milk protein-free formula.",
        "Extensively hydrolyzed formulas (eHFs): About 90% of infants with a cow's milk protein allergy can tolerate extensively hydrolyzed formulas. Although these are based on cows' milk, so the nutrient content is the same as normal infant formulas, they have been extensively broken down into tiny parts so that the child's immune system is less likely to recognize the protein. There are a number of products available, and your doctor or dietitian will be able to recommend an appropriate one for your child.",
        "Amino acid formulas (AAFs): If your child has difficulty with a hydrolyzed formula, or has severe symptoms -- such as severe skin or gastrointestinal symptoms or has had an episode of anaphylaxis -- an amino acid formula may be recommended. A number of products are available, and your doctor or dietitian will be able to recommend an appropriate one for your child."
