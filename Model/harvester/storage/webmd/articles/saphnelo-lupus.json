        "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) , more commonly known as lupus, is an autoimmune disorder , which means your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body. In people with lupus, the immune system may attack many different parts of the body, including the skin, the joints, and certain organs. This causes swelling (inflammation) that can lead to different symptoms depending on which part of the body is affected.",
        "Many people with lupus feel very tired and may have headaches and low fevers. Most people also have symptoms related to their skin and hair, such as sensitivity to sunlight, a butterfly-shaped rash on the face, sores in the mouth or nose, or hair loss. Some people may experience pain in their joints, pain in the chest while taking a deep breath, or swelling in the hands, feet, and around the eyes. Over time, lupus can damage the heart or kidneys, which can increase the risk for heart and kidney disease."

        "Some people with lupus may have relatively mild symptoms whereas others may have very severe symptoms. For many people, symptoms will change over time. Many people will have flare-ups, when symptoms become much worse for weeks or months. Some people may have periods of remission when their symptoms go away for some length of time. If a person is experiencing lupus symptoms, their disease is considered “active” at that time.",
        "The first step to treating lupus is to manage symptoms through lifestyle changes, exercise, diet, and certain medicines. But the key to treating lupus over time is to use medicines that slow down the attacks from the immune system. Oral corticosteroids (such as prednisone ) are commonly used for this purpose. Many people also take a medicine that was originally used to treat malaria, such as hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). There are also many medicines available that limit the activity of the entire immune system (immunosuppressants), such as methotrexate , azathioprine , and mycophenolate (Cellcept).",
        "Saphnelo is a different type of medicine, called a biologic. The active ingredient in Saphnelo, called anifrolumab, blocks the activity of a certain substance in the body, called type I interferon (IFN). Many people with lupus have too much of this substance, which plays an important role in sending immune system signals throughout the body. By blocking the activity of type I IFN, Saphnelo can help to reduce the swelling and symptoms that occur in people with lupus."
