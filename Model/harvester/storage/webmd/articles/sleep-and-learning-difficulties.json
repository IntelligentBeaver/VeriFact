Students who don’t get enough sleep or just don’t sleep well at night often perform poorly in school compared with those who sleep well.",
        "Why? For starters, lack of sleep affects a part of your brain called the prefrontal cortex. This region is responsible for important learning functions like working memory. When you don’t get enough sleep, your brain doesn’t function as well, and you struggle to pay attention and process information.",
        "It’s harder to switch quickly between tasks when you haven’t had enough sleep. You may make more mistakes. You may find it very hard to adjust to different learning environments or lessons throughout the day.",
        "Poor sleep affects mood and behavior, too, which can affect performance in school. It also affects the part of the brain where creative thinking happens. People who don’t get enough sleep can struggle with creative tasks or coming up with new ideas."
