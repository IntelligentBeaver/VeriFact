While snoring is annoying and causes poor sleep, it can be a symptom of a more serious sleep disorder called Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). OSA involves severe narrowing of your airway. Your lungs do not get enough fresh air, so the brain wakes you up just enough to catch your breath and unblock the air passage. If you snore loudly or have excessive sleepiness, talk to your doctor.",

Normally, a muscular valve between the esophagus and the gastric system prevents stomach acids from backing up into the esophagus. In GERD, this valve does not work properly. The stomach acids \"reflux\" or back up into the esophagus. This causes irritation and inflammation , and it can interfere with the sleep cycle.",
