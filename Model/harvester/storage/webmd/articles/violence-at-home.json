        "April 24, 2000 (Portland, Ore.) -- Carey Draeger was 19 when she met her future husband. After only two months of dating, the two decided to get married. Not long after their honeymoon, Draeger was introduced to a side of her new husband she never saw before. \"It started with emotional and verbal abuse , with him saying things like I was lucky he stayed with me or that nobody else would want me,\" she says. Soon, it wasn't unusual for him to be breaking and throwing things during their arguments.",
        "For two years this behavior continued until their daughter was born, and then the emotional abuse and fighting intensified. Over the next three years, the abuse turned physical when Draeger's husband punched her during an argument. That was the final straw: She convinced her husband to move out and leave her alone. \"I still don't know how I was able to get him to leave peacefully. I was very lucky.\""

Breaking down these myths is critical to ending the acceptance of violence in our society.\" Particularly destructive are beliefs that abuse is a private family matter or that the abuser behaves abusively because he (or she) loses control, or that the victim provokes the violence. \"Violence is not about a loss of control,\" says Kabat. \"Instead, it's about power and control.\" People do not abuse in a fit of rage -- they know very well what they are doing, she says. And to say that someone provoked any sort of abuse is to lay blame on the victim, which only serves to increase a sense of isolation and powerlessness.",

The center pairs each woman with a social worker who helps her to negotiate the legal system, document the abuse through eyewitness testimony and photographs, develop safety plans for those who decide to leave their relationships, provide emergency shelter, and help get protective orders against abusers. The center also trains staff at other hospitals to implement their own domestic violence programs. \"The center is a one-stop, one-shop place where victims of domestic violence can come,\" says Ellen Taliaferro, founder and medical director of the Violence Intervention and Prevention clinic at Parkland Hospital.",

This is especially difficult because when the home is violent, a woman's workplace is often one of the few places where she can be safe and away from her abuser.
