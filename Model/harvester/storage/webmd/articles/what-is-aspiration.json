        "Aspiration is when something you swallow \"goes down the wrong way\" and enters your airway (trachea or windpipe) or lungs. It can also happen when something goes back into your throat from your stomach. With aspiration, your airway isn’t completely blocked, unlike with choking.",
        "People who have a hard time swallowing are more likely to aspirate. Up to 15 million Americans have trouble swallowing, called dysphagia. It can be temporary or part of a more serious condition.",
        "People who might aspirate often or have problems swallowing include those who are older adults, who have had a stroke , and who have developmental disabilities.",
