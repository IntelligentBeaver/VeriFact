        "Hormone therapy after surgery may help women who have hormone receptor -positive cancer. That means the cancer needs hormones to grow. Medicines can prevent the tumor from getting the hormones. These drugs include tamoxifen for all women, and anastrozole ( Arimidex ), exemestane ( Aromasin ), and letrozole ( Femara ) for postmenopausal women. There are also other estrogen receptor blockers: elacestrant (Orserdu), fulvestrant ( Faslodex ) and toremifene ( Fareston ), for metastatic breast cancer.",
