The study, which has yet to be published, analyzed medical data from 2,405 people in Poland with an average age of 50. It found that married men were 3.2 times more likely to be obese than their unmarried counterparts.",

Each additional year increased the risk of being overweight by 3% in men and 4% in women, while the risk of obesity rose by 4% in men and 6% in women."
