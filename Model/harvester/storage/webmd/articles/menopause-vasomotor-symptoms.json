        "A hot flash feels like a sudden flare of heat. You may feel it in your upper chest, face, and other parts of your body. You may start to sweat and your skin may get flushed or blotchy. Your heart rate may go up. You may feel anxious. Sometimes it can lead to heart palpitations and dizziness . After feeling hot, you may get a chilly feeling. Or instead of heat, you may only feel a chill. Night sweats are hot flashes that happen at night. They may be combined with intense sweating and may disrupt your sleep. You might wake up very sweaty and need to change your clothes and sheets. Every person is different, so your experience with vasomotor symptoms may be different from others’ experiences. Your hot flashes may be mild or intense. You may have them every day, or just every now and then. They may be so mild that you barely even notice them or so intense that they get in the way of your daily activities."

        "Experts aren’t sure exactly what causes hot flashes, but they think there’s a link between changing hormones and your core body temperature. During menopause, your estrogen levels go down. This may affect how your body regulates its temperature. It may make your internal thermostat more sensitive to even small changes. If your body senses that it’s too warm, it goes into overdrive trying to cool it off. Your blood vessels dilate, or enlarge. This dilation sends more blood to the surface of your skin to get rid of the heat. This is your body’s attempt to cool you down."
