Halfway through, try to stop the stream of urine. This will help you identify the muscles you need to contract for Kegel exercises. Once you identify the muscles, do not practice while urinating. Do the exercises for about five minutes a day as you go about your day. After a few weeks to a month, you should start to notice some improvement."

Doing Kegel exercises regularly can help strengthen muscles that are involved in urine control. To learn how to do Kegel exercises, go to the bathroom and urinate. Halfway through, try to stop the stream of urine. This will help you identify the muscles you need to contract for Kegel exercises. Once you identify the muscles, do not practice while urinating. Do the exercises for about five minutes a day as you go about your day. After a few weeks to a month, you should start to notice some improvement.",

A non-invasive device - pants with electrical pads - work by stimulating the muscles of the pelvic floor, and helping strengthen and re-educate the muscles that help control bladder leakage. For mild stress incontinence, inserting a tampon or a contraceptive diaphragm -- prior to exercise or activities that are likely to lead to leakage -- may offer a similar benefit."
