        "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the virus that causes cervical cancer in women and genital warts in men and women. It's a virus that can be transmitted through sexual contact. During intercourse or oral sex, HPV can make its way into the genitals, mouth , or throat and cause infection.",
        "Sexually transmitted HPV comes in more than 40 different varieties. The type of the virus you get determines how it affects your body. Certain types of HPV cause genital warts . Other HPV types can make cells turn cancerous. You've probably heard that HPV causes cervical cancer, but it also causes less common cancers of the vulva, vagina , penis , anus , head, and neck.",

In fact, you might have absolutely no idea you've been infected until you develop genital warts or have an abnormal Pap test."
