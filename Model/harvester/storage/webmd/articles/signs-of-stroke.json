        "When you have a stroke , your brain suddenly stops getting the blood and oxygen it needs. The most common cause is a blocked artery in your brain. Strokes also can be caused by bleeding in the brain, which not only disrupts normal blood flow, but also puts harmful pressure on brain tissues. In either kind of stroke, your brain cells can be damaged, potentially leading to disability or even death.",
        "The earliest signs of stroke depend on which parts of your brain are affected and how bad the initial damage is. While one person might just feel a little weak on one side of the body, another might suddenly have trouble talking, walking, and seeing.",

          "text": "It depends on the type of stroke you have. For strokes caused by blood clots, doctors may give you powerful clot-busting drugs. The treatment works best when you get this medication within 3 hours of when your symptoms started; in some cases, doctors will use it up to 4.5 hours after symptoms begin. You might also get a procedure to remove a clot from your brain. If your stroke was caused by a burst blood vessel, doctors will try to stop the bleeding as soon as possible. You might need surgery to reduce pressure on your brain.",
