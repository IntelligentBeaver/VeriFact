        "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can lead to a metabolic state called rheumatoid cachexia, or muscle wasting. This form of cachexia happens when your body loses muscle mass and keeps fat mass. Your body develops this condition due to chronic inflammation and lack of physical activity from RA . Rheumatoid cachexia is common in people with RA. Experts believe that it might affect about two-thirds of people with RA.",
