In this end-of-year episode, we dive into the science of spirituality with Lisa Miller, PhD, professor at Columbia University, founder of the Spirituality Mind Body Institute and author of The Awakened Brain, about how spiritual practices strengthen our brain, fostering resilience and healing, the transformative power of viewing adversity through a spiritual lens, and the role of shared spiritual experiences in building connection. Whether you’re deeply spiritual, curious, or skeptical, this episode offers science-backed insights into living more fully.",
