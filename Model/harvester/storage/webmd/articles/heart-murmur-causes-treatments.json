        "The \"murmur\" is the sound of blood flowing. It may be passing through an abnormal heart valve, for instance. Or it may be that a condition makes your heart beat faster and forces your heart to handle more blood quicker than normal.",
        "Within the heart, there are four chambers separated by valves that control how much blood enters each chamber at any time. Healthy valves also help prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction in your heart.",
        "A healthy heart makes a \"lub-dub\" sound as it beats. The \"lub\" (systolic sound) happens when part of the heart contracts, and the mitral and tricuspid valves close. The \"dub\" (diastolic sound) occurs when part of the heart relaxes, and the aortic and pulmonic valves close. A heart murmur is an extra sound in the heartbeat -- such as a ''whooshing'' -- that is caused by turbulent blood flow through the heart valves.",
        "Your doctor may order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to diagnose a heart murmur. (Photo Credit: sudok1/Getty Images)",
        "Heart murmurs happen in many healthy children, who may outgrow them as adults. They may also happen during pregnancy. Such murmurs are called \"innocent\" heart murmurs. They are not linked to medical or heart conditions and do not need treatment or lifestyle changes.",
        "But there are exceptions. Murmurs can be linked to a damaged or overworked heart valve. Some people are born with valve problems. Others get them as a part of aging or from other heart problems."
