        "About 33% of U.S. adults have kidney disease. If you’re Black, Latino, Asian American, Pacific Islander, American Indian, or Native Hawaiian, your risk may be higher. “Black and African Americans are three times more likely than White Americans to have kidney disease,” says Sherri Onyiego, MD, PhD, medical director for Equality Health, an organization that helps primary care practices in Texas improve care for people with socioeconomic barriers. For Latinos, the risk of kidney failure is about 1.3 times higher. “Some of the risk factors associated with kidney disease include hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and heart disease . These conditions disproportionately impact minorities,” Onyiego says. Racial disparities in health care play a big role in ADPKD. Poor access to health insurance and medical care can lead to delays in diagnosis and faster kidney damage."

        "In a recent study, researchers found Black and Hispanic people got kidney failure earlier but had less access to kidney transplants. Compared with White people, Black people had 67% lower odds of getting a kidney transplant before they had dialysis . For Hispanic people, the odds were 50% lower. People from underserved communities are: Less likely to see a kidney specialist (nephrologist ) before dialysis Less likely to be evaluated and considered for a kidney transplant before dialysis More likely to have a worse outcome from dialysis The key to treating kidney disease is to diagnose and treat it early. If you don’t know you have kidney disease until it’s in a late stage, or if you face treatment delays, it may be too late to slow or stop kidney damage."
