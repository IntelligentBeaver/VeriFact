        "You need blood flow to your colon because it brings oxygen that keeps your tissues alive. If the blockage goes on for too long, it can cause serious problems. But if you get treatment soon, you should heal quickly. Ischemic colitis is more common in people over 60, but younger people can get it, too. You may hear your doctor call it ischemic bowel disease."
