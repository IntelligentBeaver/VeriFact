        "Jojoba plant",
        "Jojoba (pronounced \"ho-ho-ba\") is a woody, grey-green shrub that's native to the southwestern U.S., Baja California, and Mexico. It's now also grown in some other countries, like Argentina, Australia, and Egypt, because it grows well in warm and dry climates. Jojoba's scientific name is Simmondsia chinensis .",
        "Jojoba fruit",
        "Flowers of the jojoba plant can produce a fruit that starts out green and turns brown as it ripens. The ripened fruit looks like a large coffee bean or acorn. For this reason, you may hear jojoba called coffee nut or coffee berry, but you may also hear it called oat nut, goatnut, pignut, deernut, or a number of other names. Native Americans in the Sonora desert cooked the fruit and used the oil from crushed seeds to treat many skin and scalp conditions, such as psoriasis and acne.",
        "Jojoba oil is extracted from the seeds in the jojoba fruit, which look like large coffee beans when ripened. (Photo credits: Itsik Marom/Dreamstime)",
        "Jojoba oil",
        "Jojoba oil is pulled out of the seeds in the fruit using cold press and/or chemicals. About half of each seed is made up of oil, so it's relatively easy to extract. Chemically, jojoba oil is 98% wax, so scientists consider it to be a liquid wax rather than an oil. The oil is usually golden or light yellow in color and doesn't spoil because of its high level of antioxidants (natural compounds that protect against cell damage)."
