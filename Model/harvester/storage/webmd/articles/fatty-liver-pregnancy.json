During AFLP, fat builds up in your liver. If it’s left untreated, it can lead to liver failure. It usually shows up in the third trimester, between your 30th and 38th weeks of pregnancy, although it can crop up as early as 18 weeks or as late as four days after delivery. To treat it, your doctor will want to have you give birth as soon as possible.",

Unlike alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD), this isn’t caused by the consumption of too much alcohol. It’s likely due to not being at a healthy weight or having obesity, and to having conditions related to that. It’s estimated that 75% of people who are overweight, and up to two-thirds of people with type 2 diabetes , have NAFLD. You can have NAFLD when you enter pregnancy or develop it while you are pregnant.",
