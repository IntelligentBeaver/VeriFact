Doctors have been prescribing UDCA to treat liver disease for more than 100 years. It's been approved to treat PBC since 1997. When you have PBC, bile gets stuck inside your bile ducts and damages your liver.

        "Obeticholic acid (OCA) is another bile salt. It’s in a drug class called farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists. Ocaliva was originally approved by the FDA on an accelerated basis for adults with PBC who couldn't take UDCA or didn't get help from it. People were allowed to take it while researchers continued to study it. During that time, it was found that some people who had PBC and advanced cirrhosis developed liver failure, and that some who had PBC but didn't have cirrhosis had serious liver damage that required treatment with a liver transplant. In September 2025, the manufacturer of Ocaliva withdrew the medication from the market and stopped all clinical trials in response to a request by the FDA."
