        "“Hypertensive heart disease is a condition where the heart muscle can get damaged over time due to long-standing high blood pressure,” says Joy Gelbman, MD, a cardiologist at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian. “The heart can become big, thickened or weakened due to pumping against a high blood pressure over a long time.”",
