        "Let's take a look at an example of how habit reversal training works. Say that your child keeps picking their skin. A doctor may work with your child to replace that habit with something else, such as drumming their fingers on their knees or using a fidget toy to keep their hands occupied. If your child has a tendency to pull their hair, a doctor may work with them to replace that habit with hair twirling. These replacements are known as a “competing response”.",
        "A doctor will also help your child identify possible triggers. This way they can enact these replacements before they engage in the habit to begin with.
