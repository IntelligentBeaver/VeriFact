        "Cubital tunnel syndrome is when your ulnar nerve — one of the three main nerves in your arm — is compressed. The ulnar nerve runs from your neck to your hand and passes through a tunnel of tissue known as the cubital tunnel. This is located under a bony bump on the inside of your elbow called the medial epicondyle.",
        "“People often refer to that spot as their funny bone , because when they smack it, they get a tingly feeling in their hand due to damage to their ulnar nerve,” says Lisa Lattanza, MD, Chair of Orthopedics & Rehabilitation at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.",
        "Your ulnar nerve provides feeling to your little finger and half of your ring finger. It also controls some hand and forearm muscles. If it’s compressed at your cubital tunnel, it can lead to severe pain, numbness, tingling, and muscle weakness in the hands and arms.",

        "In most cases, cubital tunnel syndrome can be managed with conservative (nonsurgical) treatments. But more severe cases may require surgery to ease pressure on the affected nerve."
