        "The use of blood samples to detect amyloid and other markers of Alzheimer’s has become standard procedure for monitoring patients in clinical trials . But this presents logistical challenges because it requires strict, time-limited, temperature-dependent protocols.",
        "To make this process more efficient, the researchers conducted a pilot study that investigated a new way of detecting them by dropping a small blood sample onto a blood spot card, where it dries and remains at room temperature.",
