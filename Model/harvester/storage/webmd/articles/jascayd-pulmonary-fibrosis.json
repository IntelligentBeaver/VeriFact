        "If you have scarring in your lungs, you may have been diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. When the reason for this scarring is unknown, your condition is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). You likely know what a scar looks like on your skin. When your lungs have scarring, they have trouble working to move air in and out of your body. You may have sought help because you get short of breath easily, or your lung scarring may have been found during a test like an X-ray.",
        "When your lungs do not work well, you may have a decline in lung function. Health care providers may use pulmonary function tests to see how well you can move air in and out of your lungs. One measure is called forced vital capacity (FVC) . As the name suggests, FVC is the amount of air you can forcefully breathe out after taking a deep breath.",
        "Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive problem. This means that your lung scarring will get worse over time. On a brighter note , the first new medicine for this problem in over 10 years is now available. The name of this medicine is Jascayd (nerandomilast) , and it is pronounced as JASS-Kayd. Use of Jascayd may help slow the advance of IPF. We will now take a look at how well this medicine works to slow the loss of lung function."
