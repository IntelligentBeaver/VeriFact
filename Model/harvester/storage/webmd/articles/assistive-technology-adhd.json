They might tell you that your child needs to get evaluated for special education services first. If so, ask them to reach out to the public school district that your child's private school is located in. That’s because the district chooses whether or not to evaluate your child. If they do an evaluation and decide your child needs special education, they’ll create a plan that’s cost-free to you and similar to an individualized education program , although it may include fewer services. If the plan doesn’t give your child the extra support they need, you could consider moving them to a public school with more resources."

Ask the school to give your child an ADHD evaluation to find out if they qualify. If they do qualify, you and the evaluation team will work together to come up with a legal document called an individual education plan. This lists your child’s education goals as well as the services that the school will offer them. The IDEA law requires that the school at least consider providing assistive technology devices and services. If they decide assistive technology is right for your child, they should provide it for free.",
