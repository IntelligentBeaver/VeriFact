People who have this almost always say it’s worse when they’re stressed or anxious. This is at least in part because stress triggers muscle tension.",
        "Another condition related to tightness in your throat is dysphagia, which is when you have a hard time swallowing or feel like something is stuck in your throat. In one study, doctors were able to predict how severe participants’ dysphagia was based more on whether they said they had anxiety than on the standard physical exam and tests.",
