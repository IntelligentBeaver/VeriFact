        "March 23, 2023 – Nearly 200 years after his death, researchers continue to try to grant a dying wish of composer Ludwig Van Beethoven to study his health problems. Progressive hearing loss beginning in his early 20s left him deaf at his time of death, and he complained of chronic stomach problems.",
        "A DNA analysis of the composer’s hair indicates he had a genetic predisposition to liver disease and had a hepatitis B infection, which attacks the liver, in his last months of life. Those findings, combined with Beethoven’s reported alcohol use, all point to serious liver problems that have long been considered his most likely cause of death at age 56.",
        "“We can surmise from Beethoven’s ‘conversation books’, which he used during the last decade of his life, that his alcohol consumption was very regular, although it is difficult to estimate the volumes being consumed,” University of Cambridge researcher and PhD student Tristan Begg said in a statement . “While most of his contemporaries claim his consumption was moderate by early 19th century Viennese standards, there is not complete agreement among these sources, and this still likely amounted to quantities of alcohol known today to be harmful to the liver.”"
