        "Cancer didn't catch Christina Applegate unprepared. Because her mother had battled both breast cancer and ovarian cancer , Applegate had been going for regular mammograms since the age of 30. \"But when I turned 36, my doctor said that my breasts were just too dense for mammography alone, and he referred me for screening MRIs at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,\" she recalls.",
        "Just a few months before she learned she herself had breast cancer, the actor got a shocking insight into the struggles faced by other young women who are also at high risk for the disease -- and who don't have the resources of a Hollywood celebrity.",
        "\"After my second MRI , the patient relations woman who'd been taking care of me for years told me that a lot of high-risk young women were opting not to have screening MRIs because they couldn't afford it -- they cost about $3,000 each -- and insurance wouldn't cover it. It really angered me!\"",
        "Less than a year later, in 2008, Applegate -- who had landed the starring role in ABC's comedy series Samantha Who? -- was diagnosed with breast cancer, an early-stage cancer caught with the help of those MRIs. \"I was so lucky. I was really diligent about my testing, I never missed a time I was supposed to go,\" she says. \"There was no cancer detected at one three-month visit, and when I went back for another MRI three months later, there it was. The cancer actually became detectable in me within three months. Had I waited six months or a year, who knows how far it would have spread?\""
