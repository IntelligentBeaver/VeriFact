        "Thanks to medical breakthroughs, doctors can probably cure your hepatitis C. But if you don’t get treatment, it can lead to liver disease , liver cancer, or death. Despite this, there are fewer people with hepatitis C who start treatment than there were a few years ago. The number of cases is rising in the 18 to 40 age group, and it infects about 2.4 million people in the U.S. The CDC says about 120,000 of those start treatment with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs each year. But to meet public health goals and wipe out hepatitis C by 2030, that number needs to grow to 260,000 annually. Here are some other facts about hepatitis C: About people worldwide have ongoing (chronic) hepatitis C virus infection (HCV). In the last 10 years , direct-acting antiviral (DAA) medicines became available, which transformed how doctors treat hepatitis C. Today doctors can cure about 95% of people with hepatitis C. Only about 1 in 3 people who have hepatitis C and health insurance get treatment for the illness."

        "Meds that are safe and work well to treat hepatitis C have been available for years, but many people with the condition delay treatment or avoid it altogether. If your hepatitis C isn’t treated, you can pass it to others through your blood. It can also cause you to have other serious health problems including liver scarring (cirrhosis) and liver failure. But even with advances in treatment, many people put it off or decide not to get it at all. The reasons are complex. Here’s a closer look at some of them: You’re symptom-free. About half of those with the virus that causes hepatitis C live with it for decades without any symptoms. You might not have symptoms until the virus seriously damages your liver, causing liver disease. Cost. Even though their price has fallen, direct-acting antivirals can still come with a high cost. And Medicaid may not cover the expense of hepatitis C treatment. Treatment restrictions. Some states limit access to DAAs by requiring you to meet specific criteria. For example, you must have liver damage (fibrosis), be sober from alcohol and drugs, and get a prescription from a liver disease or infectious disease specialist. Certain states have eased restrictions so more people can get hepatitis C treatment."
