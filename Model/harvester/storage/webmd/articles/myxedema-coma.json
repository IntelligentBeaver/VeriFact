        "In certain conditions, the thyroid becomes underactive and produces fewer amounts of its hormones, a situation called hypothyroidism . People with hypothyroidism have problems that reflect underactivity of the organs of the body, resulting in symptoms such as fatigue , feeling cold, weight gain, dry skin , constipation, and sleepiness. When the levels of thyroid hormones become very low, the symptoms get worse and can result in a serious condition called myxedema coma . Myxedema coma is a rare but life-threatening condition. People with hypothyroidism who are in or near a coma should be taken to an emergency department immediately. Some of the hallmark symptoms are lethargy, confusion, weakness, and difficulty breathing."
