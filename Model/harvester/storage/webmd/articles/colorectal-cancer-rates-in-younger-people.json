        "After my first colonoscopy at age 51, he called to say he’d removed three precancerous growths during the procedure. Why was I so surprised? I have no family history of cancer, I don’t smoke, my alcohol intake was low, my weight was within a normal range, I exercised regularly, and I ate the suggested amount of fiber every day as part of a balanced diet.",
        "Colorectal cancer (CRC) almost always begins with precancerous polyps, or growths, in the colon or rectum. Being over 50 is a known risk factor for these abnormal polyps, so I really shouldn’t have been so put out about my test results.",
        "Here’s what’s really puzzling, though: CRC in adults under age 50 is increasing at an alarming rate.",
        "Colorectal cancer is now the number one cause of cancer-related deaths in men 20 to 49 years old in the U.S. and the second leading cause of death in women of the same age. Though screening for cancer has improved, experts say the increase in cancer cases cannot be entirely explained by better detection."

Gut dysbiosis refers to reduced variety, or diversity, within the gut microbiome, an enormous community of mostly beneficial bacteria that help regulate digestion and overall health. Gut dysbiosis contributes to inflammation, which increases CRC risk. Younger people with CRC tend to have a less diverse gut microbiome than older people with CRC.",
