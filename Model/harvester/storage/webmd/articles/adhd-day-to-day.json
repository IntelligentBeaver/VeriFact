It's not that kids shouldn't be corrected; it's that they ideally get more positive feedback than negative. Really go out of your way to find their strengths and focus on successes. One basic step is to reward the opposite of problem behaviors. Now they are working toward a goal instead of being corrected.",

For example, use a reward plan to encourage good behavior or time-outs to defuse the situation before it escalates. Talk about how to manage emotions outside of these intensely stressful moments."
