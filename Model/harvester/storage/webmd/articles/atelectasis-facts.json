        "Atelectasis (pronounced a-teh-LEK-tuh-sis) is a lung condition that happens when your airways or the tiny sacs at the end of them don’t expand the way they should when you breathe. Because of this, a part of your lung, called a lobe, or even your whole lung could collapse.",
        "Atelectasis happens when the small sacs in your lungs (alveoli) can’t inflate properly, leading to a partial or full collapse of your lungs. (Photo Credit: Anna Kuo/WebMD Ignite)",
        "Your lungs are where your body takes in oxygen and gets rid of carbon dioxide. When you breathe in, air flows into your windpipe, or trachea. The trachea splits into two channels called bronchi, and each bronchus goes to a lung.",
        "Inside your lungs, those airways divide again and again into smaller tubes called bronchioles. At the end of the smallest bronchioles are tiny sacs called alveoli. Here, your blood dumps carbon dioxide and picks up fresh oxygen to carry to the cells in your body.",
        "When you breathe in and out, your lungs inflate and deflate like balloons. But if your airways get blocked or something puts pressure on your lungs, they might not inflate the way they should. Doctors call that condition atelectasis. It can be life-threatening in small children or people who have another lung problem."
