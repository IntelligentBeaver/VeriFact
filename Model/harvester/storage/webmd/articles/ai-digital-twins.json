Volunteers are randomly divided into two groups. One group gets the experimental drug; the other, called the control group, gets a placebo (a treatment that appears identical to the drug being tested, but has no effect). If the patients who get the active drug show more improvement than the ones who get the placebo, that’s evidence that the drug is effective.",

A well-documented problem with machine learning tools is that they can be trained on biased data sets – for example, ones that underrepresent a particular group. But, says Fisher, because the trials are randomized, the results are insensitive to bias in the data. The trial measures how the drug being tested affects the people in the trial based on a comparison with the controls, and adjusts the model to more closely match the real controls. So, according to Fisher, even if the choice of subjects for the trial is biased, and the original dataset is biased, “We’re able to design trials so that they are insensitive to that bias.”"

        "Neill doesn’t find this convincing. You can remove bias in a randomized trial in a narrow sense, by adjusting your model to correctly estimate the treatment effect for the study population, but you’ll just reintroduce those biases when you try to generalize beyond the study. Unlearn.AI “is not comparing treated individuals to controls,” Neill says. \"It’s comparing treated individuals to model-based estimates of what the individual’s outcome would have been if they were in the control group. Any errors in those models or any events they fail to anticipate can lead to systematic biases – that is, over- or under-estimates of the treatment effect.”",
