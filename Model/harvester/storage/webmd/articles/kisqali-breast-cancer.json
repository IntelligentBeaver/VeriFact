        "Kisqali is a specific kind of medicine called a kinase inhibitor. Kinases are enzymes that are responsible for sending and receiving signals in the body. These signals help your cells do important functions such as grow properly. Kisqali blocks the action of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6). These kinases send signals to cancer cells that help them grow and multiply. When Kisqali blocks the signals sent by CDK4 and CDK6, it helps to stop cancer cells from growing and multiplying and makes tumors shrink in size."

This means that in every 28 days, you will take Kisqali once a day for 21 days and then not take any Kisqali for 7 days.  You can take Kisqali with or without food, and you should try to take your dose around the same time every day. Kisqali should be taken whole, and you should not crush or chew it. Do not take tablets that are broken, cracked, or damaged, and contact your pharmacy about getting them replaced. If you vomit after taking a dose of Kisqali, skip the dose and do not take an extra dose. Take your next Kisqali dose as scheduled.",
        "You will continue taking Kisqali for as long as possible. This means you will take it until your cancer progresses or you have side effects that make it not safe for you to take. If you have certain side effects, your health care provider may change or pause your doses of Kisqali. In some cases, they may need to have you stop taking Kisqali completely.",
        "If you have problems with your liver or kidneys, your dose of Kisqali will likely be lowered to make sure it is safe for you. Talk with your health care provider about your medical history so they can decide what the best dose of Kisqali is for you."

        "In the MONALEESA-2 clinical trial, women and people who were assigned female at birth and were postmenopausal (menopause had already occurred) took Kisqali combined with an aromatase inhibitor hormone therapy called letrozole or a placebo with letrozole for HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer that had not been treated for the advanced cancer. A placebo is used in clinical trials as a control so that a new medicine in a group of people can be compared in a similar group of people who did not receive the new medicine. Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor that blocks estrogen in the body. The clinical trial included 668 people, with 334 people taking Kisqali. They were followed to see how long it took for their breast cancer to progress, meaning that the cancer grew or spread. This measurement is called progression-free survival. The median progression-free survival was 25.3 months for Kisqali plus letrozole compared to 16 months for placebo plus letrozole. This means that half of the people who took Kisqali did not have their cancer progress for at least 25.3 months compared to 16 months for people who took placebo. This study also looked at median overall survival, which measured how long half of the people in the study who received a certain medicine survived after starting to use the medicine. People who took Kisqali plus letrozole in the study had a median overall survival of 63.9 months, while people who took a placebo plus letrozole had a median overall survival of 51.4 months. This means that half of the people who took Kisqali survived for at least 63.9 months compared to 51.4 months for the people who took placebo.",

Goserelin is a type of hormone therapy that lowers estrogen along with the aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen. The clinical trial included 672 people, with 335 people taking Kisqali. The median progression-free survival was 23.8 months for people who took Kisqali compared to 13 months for people who took placebo. This means that half of the people who took Kisqali did not have their cancer progress for at least 23.8 months. The overall survival was measured after 42 months of starting treatment. When this was measured, 70.2% of people who took Kisqali were still alive compared to 46% of the people who took a placebo."
