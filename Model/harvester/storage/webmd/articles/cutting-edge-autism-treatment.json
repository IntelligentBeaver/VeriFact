        "Teaching play with video modeling is something new that the NECC is studying. On the staff working with the kids are not only educators, but also researchers, and they report on what happens at the NECC to the scientific community. Video modeling is just one small part of the NECC's whole approach, called \"applied behavioral analysis,\" widely regarded as the gold standard in autism treatment .",
        "In the simplest terms, applied behavior analysis offers carrots, with no stick. Children are engaged in learning new behaviors and helped to change disruptive or harmful ones, by constant positive reinforcement. The curriculum at the NECC ranges from the most basic language and social skills to academics and vocational training. \"We plug them into that wherever they're at,\" says Rebecca MacDonald, PhD, director of the preschool program, which includes kids aged 3 to 7.",
        "Another new area she is studying is what's called \"joint attention,\" an important early step in relating to others. If you were to turn and look at something, a typical child observing you would probably turn to look at it, too. An autistic child would not notice. \"It's one of the hallmarks of autism ,\" MacDonald tells WebMD. \"They tend not to care what you are looking at or thinking.\"",
        "To encourage them to care, she will make something interesting or rewarding happen if the child follows her gaze. For example, she'll activate an electronic toy by remote control if the child looks at it when she does. Improving joint attention behavior won't make all other social skills fall easily into place. Like video modeling, it's just one tool used in the intensive work that the NECC does. Kids who attend the school go for 30 hours a week, all year long."
