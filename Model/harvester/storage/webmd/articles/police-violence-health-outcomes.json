        "She chose the latter. Doctors declared Tamir dead the next day. Her daughter, Tasheona, then 18, and Tavon at first responded with anger and rebellion, and over time, as each struggled in their own way, Rice and her children were diagnosed with PTSD .",
        "The family has still not fully recovered. For years after Tamir's death, Tajai, who was inseparable from Tamir, wouldn't eat certain snacks like cheese pizza, cereal, or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches because they reminded her of her brother."
