Your symptoms may stay stable for a while or get better or worse over time. Most symptoms are mild, but others are more serious. It’s rare, but some problems can cause vision loss if you don’t get care quickly. Just because you have one symptom of thyroid eye disease doesn’t mean you’ll have all of them.
