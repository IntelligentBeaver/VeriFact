        "When you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes , it can lead to even more health problems. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is an eye disease that happens to about 10% of people with diabetes. It can happen to you over time if you have poorly controlled blood sugar that damages the small blood vessels in your eyes and other places in your body. Fluid then leaks into the fovea, or center area of your macula (part of your retina). This part of your eye controls your sharp, straight-ahead vision. Symptoms of DME include: Blurry vision Seeing double A sudden spike in eye floaters If you have DME, your doctor may suggest you make lifestyle changes to help slow the disease. Those may include eating nutritious food, getting enough exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking, and managing your blood sugar and blood pressure."

To get the most benefits for your eyes, exercise for at least 150 minutes a week. Even moderate exercise helps. Any movement works, like taking a walk, riding a bike, going for a hike, or doing water aerobics. But talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise program."

        "When you have diabetes, you’re more likely to have high blood pressure, which can worsen your DME. Lowering your blood pressure can reduce your chances of further illness. Here are some tips to keep your blood pressure in check: Lose weight. Doctors say weight loss is one of the best ways to lower blood pressure, if you’re overweight. Losing even 10 pounds can help. Limit alcohol. High blood pressure can come from drinking too much. Try limiting yourself to one alcoholic drink a day. Exercise. Dancing, walking, or biking are some exercises you might try, but all movement counts. Remember to add weightlifting to your workout schedule. Lower stress. Short-term jumps in your blood pressure can happen when your stress hormones narrow your blood vessels. Stress can also lead to harmful habits that put your health in harm’s way. Those include things like drug and alcohol misuse, sleep problems, and eating too much. Ease your stress with activities like deep breathing and meditation."
