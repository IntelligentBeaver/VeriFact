        "Dysgraphia is a learning disability that affects a person's writing. It can make it hard for someone to write clearly by hand. Depending on the type of dysgraphia, it can also make it difficult to spell. It's a neurological (nervous system) disorder that affects the fine motor skills needed to write or spell or the brain process needed to do the task. It also can affect the ability to do math. A lot of what the brain does to write also affects math and writing numbers. Health insurers and most doctors call dysgraphia \"an impairment in written expression.\"",
        "Because writing clearly and correctly is a key focus of a child's elementary school years, dysgraphia can have a significant impact on their learning.",
        "Dysgraphia vs. dyslexia",
        "Dysgraphia and dyslexia both are neurological problems that affect language, but they do so in different ways. Writing something on a paper uses a lot of brain power. This ranges from coding (knowing how to form and recall letters and numbers so you can write them), organization, memory, and using the fine motor skills you need to actually write. If any of these areas don't work properly, then it can cause dysgraphia."
