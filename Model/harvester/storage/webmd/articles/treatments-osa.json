Getting on the right treatment will reduce your snoring and other symptoms, and could help you avoid complications like heart failure, type 2 diabetes , and accidents. But how do you know which treatment is right for you? Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the main treatment for OSA, but it’s not the only way to reduce symptoms. You can also try healthy lifestyle changes, oral devices, and surgery to manage this common sleep disorder."

        "In sleep apnea, tissues in the back of your throat relax and block the flow of air into your airway while you sleep. That's why your breathing stops and starts, and you wake up many times a night. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is a machine that gently pushes air into your airways while you sleep. The air flows through a mask that you wear over your nose and/or mouth. Your doctor might recommend PAP if you have moderate to severe OSA, which means your breathing stops 15 or more times each hour you sleep."

        "The most common type of PAP is continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP. It delivers a constant stream of air into your lungs during the night. Auto-titrating positive airway pressure (APAP) is another type where the air pressure changes based on your breathing patterns. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) delivers air at one pressure when you breathe in, and a different pressure when you breathe out. CPAP is the “gold-standard” OSA treatment because it works. It reduces the number of breathing pauses and prevents daytime sleepiness. Cons: CPAP only works if you wear it. Some people find the device too clunky, uncomfortable, and loud to use every night. CPAP can also cause side effects like dry mouth , nosebleeds, and dry eyes ."

        "The FDA has approved the GLP-1 medication tirzepatide, marketed under the brand name Zepbound,  as a treatment  for adults with obesity and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea . It works on gut hormones that control hunger and helps you lose weight when you take it as part of a program that includes exercise and a reduced-calorie diet. A well-balanced diet and aerobic exercise promote weight loss and may make OSA less severe. The Mediterranean diet, which is high in fruits, vegetables , and fish, may help reduce apnea symptoms. Exercise also improves daytime sleepiness. When you sleep on your back, your tongue falls down over your throat and can block your airway. Sleeping on your side or stomach may improve apnea symptoms. Quit smoking. The nicotine in tobacco products relaxes the upper airway. Nicotine also disrupts sleep. Cut back on drinking. Alcohol relaxes your tongue muscles and can cause more apnea episodes. Heavy drinkers (15 drinks a week for men, eight drinks for women) are at higher risk for OSA. But even people who drink smaller amounts of alcohol may have more severe sleep apnea."
