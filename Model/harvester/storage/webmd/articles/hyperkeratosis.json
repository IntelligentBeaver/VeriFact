Other types of hyperkeratosis are rarer, such as epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, which is genetic — you’re born with it. Some forms are autoimmune, such as psoriasis. Before trying to treat hyperkeratosis on your own, it’s best to check with your health care provider to get a diagnosis. Then, you can discuss if any OTC products are a good idea, or if you need medical treatment."
