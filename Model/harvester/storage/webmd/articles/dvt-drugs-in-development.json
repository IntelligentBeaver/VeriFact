This can happen in older medications like warfarin or some of the newer drugs, such as apixaban (Eliquis), approved in 2014, or rivaroxaban (Xarelto), approved in 2012. People with cancer are especially at risk from this side effect. So studies have focused on finding new drugs that will better work for them.
