        "If you have social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, the stress of these situations is too much to handle. You might, for example, avoid all social contact because things that other people consider “normal” — like making small talk and eye contact — make you very uncomfortable. The disorder impacts your relationships, work life, and other daily activities. Depending on the severity of your SAD, not just your social life, all aspects of your life could start to fall apart.",
        "Social anxiety disorder affects about 15 million adults in the U.S. Women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB) are almost twice as likely to develop SAD as men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB). SAD typically begins in the early teen years. About 90% of people with SAD are diagnosed before age 23. Some research suggests that developing the disorder in adulthood ups your risk of other conditions, such as panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
        "SAD is one of the most common mental disorders but can be treated effectively. The tough part is asking for help. Here’s how to know if your social fears have gone beyond shyness to a point where you need to see a doctor."
