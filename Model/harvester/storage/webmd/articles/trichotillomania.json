        "Trichotillomania is a type of impulse control disorder where people have an irresistible urge to pull out their hair, usually from their scalp, eyelashes, and eyebrows. It's also called hairpulling, hairpulling disorder, TTM, and trich. Mental health professionals think of trichotillomania as a “body-focused repetitive behavior.” Body-focused repetitive behaviors are habits like pulling your hair, biting your nails, or chewing on your lips that become extreme or get in the way of enjoying life.",
        "Most commonly, people with trichotillomania pull out hair from their scalp. They may also pull out their eyelashes, eyebrows, facial hair (like beards or mustaches), or armpit, leg, or pubic hair. Often, they pull when they're stressed or bored as a way to soothe themselves.",
        "Trichotillomania is a type of impulse control disorder. People with these disorders know that it might be harmful if they act on an impulse like hairpulling, but they cannot stop themselves. Trichotillomania can cause hair loss, including uneven bald patches, that can make people feel self-conscious or embarrassed. This can lead to emotional distress or avoiding social situations. Even though having trichotillomania or pulling your hair is not your fault, there can be social stigma around talking about it."

        "Doctors aren't sure exactly how common trichotillomania is because many people who have it don't tell their doctors. Stigma can make it hard to ask for help. Scientists think 3.5% of all people experience hairpulling at some point in their life, and it might be higher.",
        "Trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder sometimes caused by anxiety or stress. This condition can start in childhood and last a lifetime. (Photo credit: Richard Usatine, MD)",
        "Why does pulling hair feel good?",
        "For many people with trichotillomania, hairpulling is a response to stress, frustration, or boredom. It can feel comforting and give you a place to direct your energy or something to do. Even if you know you might feel upset about it later, pulling can feel pleasant and satisfying in the moment. It might also help you feel in control during stressful situations.",
        "Hairpulling can become a habit. This creates a cycle in your brain where you think about the habit and feel the urge to do it. When you do, your brain releases “reward” chemicals like dopamine, which makes you feel happy and calm. Your body then connects doing the habit with feeling good, which in turn strengthens the habit and makes the urge to do it more intense. For people who feel a strong urge to pull, actually pulling can bring a sense of relief because they are no longer focused on the urge."

To help prevent damage, doctors say to pull your eyebrow hair in the same direction it grows and use angled metal tweezers with sharp, skinny points. Tweezers with rubber tips or wide, flat points are rougher on your hair and skin, which makes it harder for eyebrows to grow back."

While ADHD is not an impulse control disorder like trichotillomania, it can cause problems with impulse control .

In one study that looked at people with trichotillomania, almost 1 in 6 also had ADHD. In general, only about 2 or 3 out of 100 people have ADHD. People who have ADHD and trichotillomania might have more issues with controlling their impulses than people who only have one condition. Scientists think some people with ADHD might pull to help themselves focus. People who have trouble paying attention also might not notice if they are pulling out their hair.",
