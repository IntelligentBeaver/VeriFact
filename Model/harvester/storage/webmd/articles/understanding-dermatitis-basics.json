        "Dermatitis is a broad term that describes various types of skin inflammation (skin rashes). The most common early symptom is red, dry, itching skin. Severe cases can include crusty scales, painful cracks in your skin, or blisters that ooze fluid. Since a range of things can irritate your skin, your doctor will try to narrow their diagnosis to a specific kind of dermatitis. That can help them pinpoint the cause and choose the best treatment to heal your skin.",

        "Psoriasis is a type of dermatitis. In this case, your body makes skin cells in days rather than weeks, which means the skin cells will pile up on parts of your skin as thick, scaly, silver-looking patches. These patches can appear anywhere on your body but are most common on the knees, elbows, lower back, and scalp. They tend to be itchy, and the itchiness can become severe without treatment. Psoriasis is an ongoing (chronic) condition which has no cure.",
        "If you have psoriasis, it tends to flare up when you have an infection, get a cut or burn, are exposed to smoke, drink heavily, or take certain medicines. Cold weather can also make it flare up."
