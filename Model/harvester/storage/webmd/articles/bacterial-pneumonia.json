        "Bacterial pneumonia is an infection of your lungs caused by certain bacteria. The most common one is Streptococcus (pneumococcus), but other bacteria can cause it too. If you’re young and basically healthy, these bacteria can live in your throat without causing any trouble. But if your body’s defenses (immune system) become weak for some reason, the bacteria can go down into your lungs . When this happens, the air sacs in your lungs get infected and inflamed. They fill up with fluid, and that causes pneumonia .",

        "People who have a weakened immune system also have an increased risk for bacterial pneumonia. These include those who recently had an organ transplant . People who are HIV positive, or who have leukemia , lymphoma , or severe kidney disease also stand a greater chance of developing the infection."
