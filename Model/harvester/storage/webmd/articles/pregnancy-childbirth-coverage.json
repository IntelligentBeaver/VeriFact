Some didn't cover it at all.",
        "The ACA doesn't spell out all of the specific benefits that must be covered while you're pregnant and after the baby is born. But many preventive care services must be covered without extra out-of-pocket costs, like co-pays, co-insurance, or deductibles. For moms, that includes preventive services for preconception and prenatal care and well-baby check-ups plus comprehensive lactation support, counseling, and breastfeeding equipment.",
        "Preventive care also includes screening tests for anemia , gestational diabetes , hepatitis B, and a blood condition known as Rh incompatibility. It also covers folic acid supplements , if you have a prescription. Folic acid helps you to have a healthy baby. New moms can also get information about services to help with things like identifying and treating post-partum depression, stopping smoking, preventing violence, and more. There's no extra cost for any of these visits, tests, or supplements."
