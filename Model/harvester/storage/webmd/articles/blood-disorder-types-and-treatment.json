        "We recently sat down",

        "SUNIL VERMA: It's great to be",
        "here, John.",
        "Thank you.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: Well, let's start",
        "off and get right at it",
        "because you talk about the need",
        "to transform oncology care.",
        "So if we need to transform it,",
        "what do we need to change",
        "that we're currently doing?",
        "SUNIL VERMA: So there are",
        "some important elements that we",
        "have to consider as we think",
        "about what are those challenges.",
        "So one is the complexity",
        "of care.",
        "When we think about the options",
        "patients have, clinicians have,",
        "even 5, 10 years ago, we really",
        "had chemotherapy, radiation",
        "therapy, surgery,",
        "and targeted treatments.",
        "Then, of course, came",
        "immune therapy, which has really",
        "helped many patients.",
        "But thinking about the next 10,",
        "15, 20 years with antibody drug",
        "conjugates, cell therapies,",
        "radio conjugates, the complexity",
        "of care",
        "is going to be substantially",
        "more complex.",
        "And I think we need to make sure",
        "that we are partnering",
        "effectively to simplify",
        "care and not make it",
        "more complex.",
        "So an important element of how",
        "we think about partnership,",
        "how we think",
        "about the future state,",
        "is how do we make sure that we",
        "simplify the care decision",
        "making so that patients are",
        "able to access the right therapy",
        "at the right time in a more",
        "meaningful manner.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: I mentioned to you",
        "before we went on that I follow",
        "you on LinkedIn",
        "and like your profile.",
        "You talk a lot on LinkedIn",
        "about the need",
        "for these partnerships.",
        "Who do we need to be",
        "partnering with?",
        "Is it the patient community?",
        "Is it regulators?",
        "And they don't think",
        "of partnership in the same way.",
        "Where are those partnerships",
        "in your mind",
        "that we need to be more",
        "focused on?",
        "SUNIL VERMA: As a clinician",
        "and thinking and delivering",
        "about cancer care",
        "and through my academic and",
        "clinical care,",
        "you tend to be very focused",
        "right on the patient in front",
        "of you.",
        "How do we bring",
        "the right therapies and the best",
        "therapies to that patient?",
        "But I think being in industry",
        "and being",
        "in pharmaceutical companies",
        "over the last few years,",
        "it has really given me",
        "an appreciation that the health",
        "ecosystem is very broad,",
        "and the partners who are part",
        "of that ecosystem",
        "need to be much",
        "better integrated.",
        "And these partnerships include",
        "from diagnostic companies",
        "to make sure we have",
        "the right biomarker information,",
        "from data companies who are",
        "able to assimilate information",
        "and provide information",
        "to the clinicians,",
        "to the health systems, and maybe",
        "the patients in the future.",
        "We have to think",
        "about the health",
        "tech companies who are also",
        "involved in thinking about how",
        "do we make sure",
        "that the patients have",
        "the right information",
        "on their hands.",
        "But we are collecting",
        "the right information",
        "from patients to make",
        "the clinical journey much",
        "better, much smoother.",
        "We're thinking about also how do",
        "we leverage the new emerging",
        "technologies, such as AI,",
        "into the mix and also",
        "the education companies-- of how",
        "do we make sure the information",
        "is disseminated",
        "to the clinicians",
        "and to patients along the way.",
        "So that whole health ecosystem",
        "requires partnerships.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: We can't talk",
        "about transforming oncology care",
        "and not talk specifically",
        "about AI.",
        "So you've mentioned it a couple",
        "of times.",
        "And I'd want to know where you",
        "kind of sit on that continuum",
        "where there are some folks that",
        "are saying, \"You know what?",
        "We haven't even scratched",
        "the surface of the power of AI.\"",
        "And there's others that will",
        "say, \"You know what?",
        "It's never going to replace",
        "a physician and make that",
        "cancer diagnosis.\"",
        "And there's others over here",
        "that will say, \"Everyone should",
        "have a second opinion",
        "that's generated by AI.\"",
        "So where does Dr. Verma stand",
        "on the role of AI",
        "in transforming cancer care?",
        "SUNIL VERMA: I think, John, AI",
        "is here to stay and will improve",
        "cancer care decision-making.",
        "So to share a couple of examples",
        "and also where we see the future",
        "of AI in the",
        "decision-making process--",
        "so as a breast cancer",
        "clinician 20, 25 years ago",
        "when I started",
        "my clinical career,",
        "a patient with hormone receptor",
        "positive breast cancer who would",
        "come and see me, I would have",
        "an option.",
        "I can give",
        "this patient chemotherapy,",
        "or I can give",
        "this patient",
        "endocrine treatment.",
        "Those were the two options",
        "Ten years ago, 5 years ago, we",
        "may have five different options:",
        "endocrine therapy,",
        "endocrine plus",
        "targeted chemotherapy.",
        "If you think about the next 5",
        "to 10 years, there may be 10,",
        "15 different options",
        "for that specific patient.",
        "Now, there's a multitude",
        "of factors that can determine",
        "what is the right option",
        "for that patient.",
        "It could be how they responded",
        "to prior therapies.",
        "What is their disease status?",
        "What is their",
        "biomarker information?",
        "What is the cancer treatment",
        "resistance pathway that",
        "has evolved?",
        "All of that element and all",
        "of that information",
        "is really",
        "difficult for a clinician",
        "to track, measure, comprehend,",
        "to provide a specific",
        "treatment decision.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: And everyone's not",
        "a specialist as you are",
        "that's treating.",
        "SUNIL VERMA: Absolutely not",
        "everybody is a specialist.",
        "And maybe at an esteemed",
        "cancer center",
        "and an academic institution,",
        "you're able to assimilate",
        "and there is a structure.",
        "But we need to make sure",
        "that the information is",
        "available, accessible, scalable,",
        "and to make an informed decision",
        "irrespective of where",
        "the patient is going to go.",
        "And so AI machine learning has",
        "a critical role in taking a look",
        "at all of those information",
        "streams to be able to augment,",
        "to be able to support",
        "the clinical",
        "decision-making process.",
        "So I do feel that in the next 5",
        "to 10 years,",
        "a clinician who is sitting",
        "in front of a patient will say,",
        "\"Based on my experience,",
        "here's a recommendation.",

        "learning, here is",
        "a recommendation that is",
        "specific to you.\"",
        "And that information will lead",
        "to a better decision-making",
        "for the individual patient.",
        "But also, and just as",
        "importantly, it will also lead",
        "to less disparity in care",
        "between different institutions.",
        "Because what you're doing is",
        "you're really trying",
        "to personalize the care",
        "for that patient.",
        "And irrespective of where",
        "the patient goes,",
        "that information",
        "is accessible to make sure",
        "that that individual patient",
        "will have the right",
        "treatment decision.",
        "So that element is, I",
        "think, critical.",
        "And I think AI is going to have",
        "a significant role.",
        "And just as importantly, where",
        "we're talking about patient",
        "experience, imagine a patient",
        "who can also learn as to what",
        "their experience could be",
        "on a specific medicine, using",

        "this medicine?\"",
        "JOHN WHYTE: Let's just even look",
        "at breast cancer",
        "and colorectal cancer screening",
        "where we have guidelines.",
        "We talk about guidelines.",
        "But then the guidelines",
        "sometimes are",
        "different between different",
        "professional societies,",
        "and that can be",
        "confusing to clinicians.",
        "What's the right age?",
        "What's the right methodology?",
        "And then it can also",
        "be confusing to patients.",
        "Am I at average risk?",

        "on different medical groups?",
        "It can really be frustrating.",
        "What's your counsel to them?",
        "SUNIL VERMA: So first of all, I",
        "am a strong advocate",
        "for guideline-based care.",
        "I think the literature",
        "and the evidence clearly",
        "points out",
        "that following guideline-based",
        "care leads to better and more",
        "improved patient outcomes.",
        "I think where there may",
        "be inconsistencies",
        "or maybe",
        "different interpretations",
        "is really what is the endpoint",
        "that is being measured in some",
        "of the studies",
        "or some of the guidelines.",
        "And that endpoint can vary",
        "from earlier diagnosis.",
        "And are we diagnosing patients",
        "at an early-stage setting",
        "to an endpoint?",
        "Are we truly improving survival",
        "for patients by doing that?",

        "So what we can do,",
