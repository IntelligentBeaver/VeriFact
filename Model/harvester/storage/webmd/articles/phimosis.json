        "The foreskin is a piece of tissue that covers the head of the penis. Babies are born with a tight foreskin that's often removed in a procedure called a circumcision. If it's left in place, the foreskin gradually loosens as the child grows. Usually by about age 6 it can be pulled back completely to pee and to clean underneath it. Rarely, the foreskin can stay tight into the teenage years. Phimosis can also appear later in life.",

        "Phimosis can sometimes lead to a dangerous condition called paraphimosis . That's when the foreskin gets stuck behind the head of the penis and can't be pushed back into place. It can happen when the foreskin is tight and you force it to retract. It can cut off the flow of blood to your penis and needs to be treated right away.",
