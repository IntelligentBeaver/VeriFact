        "How migraine feels can change as you age. You don’t “grow out of them,” but as your hormones change, so can your symptoms.",
        "“For many people, migraine improves as they get older,” says Jaclyn Rosencutter Duvall, MD, a neurologist at Headache Specialists of Oklahoma in Tulsa, Oklahoma. “Attacks often become less frequent and severe, especially after menopause, when hormone levels stabilize. Some people may still have headaches, but they often change in pattern or become easier to manage.”",
        "But that’s not true for everyone. Many factors can cause your migraine attacks to worsen as you get older. Here’s why it happens and what you can do about it.",
