While you may need to delay reconstruction until you’re done with other cancer treatments, many people choose not to rebuild their breasts at all. Some people call this going flat.

For others, the decision may come after having a breast reconstruction surgery they’re unsatisfied with. Here are some other reasons you may choose to go flat after removal of one or both of your breasts: You want to recover faster after breast cancer surgery. You don’t want a foreign object in your body. You don’t want more surgeries on top of cancer treatment . You want to avoid any breast implant-related problems. You don’t want multiple scars from flap reconstruction. You don’t link your self-esteem or body image to your breasts. You’re fine wearing an artificial breast form."

        "Not everyone has the choice to rebuild their breasts right away, if at all. Your doctor may recommend delayed or no reconstruction if you have inflammatory breast cancer , need radiation therapy after surgery, or have health conditions that make extra surgeries risky. Disparities in health care may also play a role. For instance, you may not have access to a skilled plastic surgeon in your area, or your insurance provider may not cover the full cost of certain procedures. Some people can’t afford childcare or to take time off from work to recover from added surgeries. Studies show around 36% of people avoid reconstruction because they’re afraid of breast implants. Some people don’t understand the procedure. And while no one should pressure you to rebuild your breasts, it’s important to know that reconstruction with implants is generally considered safe and doesn’t make it more likely that the cancer will come back or harder to detect cancer down the road."

If you’re doctor doesn’t support your decision to go flat, it’s OK to get a second opinion .

When it comes to going flat after mastectomy, here are some questions you can ask your surgical team: Will the plastic surgeon do the flat closure at the same time as the mastectomy? Will I need to heal for a few months before I get flat closure surgery? Will the surgeon remove excess skin and fat tissue beside my breast, under my arm? Will radiation affect flat closure? Can you put me in touch with someone who’s gone flat? Will I need more surgery after flat closure? Is going flat more likely to make my chest feel numb? Ask your cancer doctor or breast surgeon to refer you to a plastic surgeon with experience in flat closure. You can also search for specialists through the directory of “flat-friendly” surgeons on the Not Putting on a Shirt website."

        "Breast reconstruction is still an option for most people who go flat after a mastectomy, even months or years down the road. You can change your mind after you’ve already had surgery to go flat. But it’s best to ask a plastic surgeon about all your reconstruction options before your mastectomy. If you have reconstruction after your chest is flat, you might need: Tissue expanders. These are inflatable sacs that go under the skin or muscle in your chest. Your surgeon will fill them with a saltwater mix on a regular basis, such as every 1 to 3 weeks. This will stretch your chest skin over the course of several months to make space for an implant. Flap surgery. This is a type of reconstruction that uses tissue from another part of your body (like your belly or thighs) to rebuild your breast. It’s something your doctor might suggest if you have radiation or you don’t have enough chest skin after your mastectomy. It’s important to know that health insurers must cover breast reconstruction due to a mastectomy, even if you decide to rebuild your breasts years later.
