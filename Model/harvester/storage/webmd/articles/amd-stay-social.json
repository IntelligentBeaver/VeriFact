        "Life with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) takes adjustment. Not only are you learning to adapt to new sight challenges, you’re also coming to terms with a lifelong diagnosis and what it may mean for your future. It’s common to feel loss, denial, anger, and even depression after an AMD diagnosis. You may have a change in your personality and outlook on life. It’s important to stay anchored in the friends, family, and community who care for you as you navigate your new normal. Staying connected to others can help you avoid depression, especially when you live with AMD. That connection helps protect you from feeling isolated, which often comes with vision loss , by giving you social support and a sense of belonging."

You may be dealing with depression if you have: Low energy Lack of motivation Trouble enjoying things you used to Changes to your appetite Trouble concentrating A numb or “flat” feeling You may also feel cranky and sleep more than usual or less than usual. Depression isn’t a personal failing. It’s a condition caused by chemical changes in your brain, and you can treat it with therapy and medication. The important thing is that you talk to others about how you’re feeling. Isolation can make depression worse. Sharing your symptoms with your doctor or mental health professional is a great place to start, but reach out to the people who love you, too.

When you are able to ask for social, emotional , and practical support, you can maintain independence for longer. If you’re wondering where to start, try these steps: Think about who you’d like to include as part of your “team.” This can be close friends, loved ones, faith leaders, a counselor, or even neighbors. Have a conversation about what the world looks like for you. It can be hard for those who don’t live with AMD to know how it feels to go through everyday life with low vision. A demonstration or explanation can help them better understand the challenges you face. Come up with practical things your team can do to help. This may be as simple as “Have a regular coffee date to check in,” or “Drive me to the grocery store and help me shop once a week.” Include fun on your list. How can your team help you not just survive, but thrive? Add it to your wants."
