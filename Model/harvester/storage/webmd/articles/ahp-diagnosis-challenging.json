        "Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) is a group of four genetic diseases that affect the nervous system. Each type causes attacks of belly pain and other symptoms that range from mild and occasional to severe and frequent. AHP is rare, and its symptoms look like the symptoms of other more common conditions. These things make it difficult to diagnose. It can sometimes take years to get the right diagnosis. Undiagnosed AHP increases the risk for serious complications and can even be life-threatening. That's why it's important to see a doctor if you have symptoms and advocate for yourself until you get a diagnosis."

        "Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history and will examine you. They might also ask if anyone in your family has AHP, although most people with this condition don't have it in their family. To diagnose AHP, doctors look for three types of symptoms, which doctors call the \"classic triad\": Central nervous system symptoms like anxiety, depression, tiredness, confusion, and seizures Peripheral nervous system symptoms like nerve pain and muscle weakness Belly pain A combination of blood, urine, and stool tests can help your doctor confirm the diagnosis. Because AHP is so rare, many labs don't have the right equipment or experience to diagnose it. Your doctor might have to send your test samples to a special lab, and it could take one to two weeks to get your results. Urine tests A urine test is often the first test doctors order to diagnose AHP. This test can't confirm that you have the condition, but it's one clue that you might. Urine tests check for these substances: Aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). In AHP, your body is missing an enzyme you need to make heme — part of the protein hemoglobin that carries oxygen in your blood. Porphyrins are substances your body uses to make heme. Delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) are ingredients that go into making heme. They're called porphyrin precursors. When your body can't make heme, these materials build up in your body and damage your nerve cells."

To diagnose AHP, doctors look for three types of symptoms, which doctors call the \"classic triad\": Central nervous system symptoms like anxiety, depression, tiredness, confusion, and seizures Peripheral nervous system symptoms like nerve pain and muscle weakness Belly pain A combination of blood, urine, and stool tests can help your doctor confirm the diagnosis. Because AHP is so rare, many labs don't have the right equipment or experience to diagnose it. Your doctor might have to send your test samples to a special lab, and it could take one to two weeks to get your results. Urine tests A urine test is often the first test doctors order to diagnose AHP. This test can't confirm that you have the condition, but it's one clue that you might. Urine tests check for these substances: Aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). In AHP, your body is missing an enzyme you need to make heme — part of the protein hemoglobin that carries oxygen in your blood. Porphyrins are substances your body uses to make heme. Delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) are ingredients that go into making heme. They're called porphyrin precursors. When your body can't make heme, these materials build up in your body and damage your nerve cells."
