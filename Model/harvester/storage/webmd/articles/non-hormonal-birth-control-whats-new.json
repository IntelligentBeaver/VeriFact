You’re medically unable to take hormonal birth control. You don’t have sex often enough to continuously take birth control.

        "There are several types of nonhormonal birth control options available that don’t need surgery. These include: Barrier methods. This is any birth control that acts as a barrier between the sperm and the egg to prevent fertilization, such as: Intrauterine device (IUD). The ParaGard or copper IUD is a T-shaped plastic device that’s wrapped in copper coil. Your doctor will place it inside your uterus during an in-office procedure. The copper wiring on the IUD makes your uterus a toxic environment for the sperm or the egg, which prevents pregnancy. Effectiveness: IUDs are both safe and highly effective. The IUD can stay inside your uterus for up to 10 years and prevent pregnancies more than 99% of the time. Pros and cons: You can remove an IUD at any time. If you’re planning to get pregnant, tell your doctor. They’ll remove it during an in-office visit. In some cases, IUDs can cause bleeding between periods, heavy periods, pain, and cramping. If it’s bothersome, let your doctor know about it."

        "IUDs are available as both hormonal and nonhormonal. If you don’t want the hormones, let your doctor know about your preference. Formerly known as male condoms, it’s the most popular type of nonhormonal birth control. You’ll need to wear a condom over the penis. It works by keeping the semen, the fluid that contains sperm, and sexually transmitted infections (STI) from entering the vagina. It’s usually made from latex, a type of rubber. But if you’re allergic to latex, you can find condoms made from other materials. Effectiveness: You can use a condom only once and you’ll have to throw it away after that use. The effectiveness varies. It usually works anywhere between 80%-98% of the time Pros and cons: Condoms are easy to use and can usually be found at your local grocery store, pharmacy, or online. You don’t need a prescription to buy or use them. But read the instructions properly. Don’t use latex condoms with oil-based lubricants like baby oil, lotions, or petroleum jelly. This may cause it to break or tear. If it breaks during or before sex, it might increase your risk for pregnancy or an STI. Internal condom. Formerly known as a female condom, it’s inserted into the vagina. It’s made of stretchy plastic material and contains two rings. The smaller ring is inserted inside while the larger one opens at the front of the vagina. Effectiveness: It’s less effective than an external condom. Research shows that it might fail to act as effective birth control around 2 out of 10 times. Pros and cons : Like the external condom, it’s designed to stop the sperm from meeting the egg. When used properly, it also protects you from STIs. A person can ejaculate into the internal condom after sex. It can be worn up to 8 hours before you have sex. It’s best for your partner not to wear a condom over their penis as it might tear from the friction and fail to act as birth control."

        "The FDA recently approved this nonhormonal birth control in the form of a vaginal gel. It contains three ingredients: lactic acid, citric acid, and potassium bitartrate. And it comes in a prefilled tampon-like applicator. The vaginal gel coats the walls and the cervix and makes the area more acidic. This stops the sperm from being able to swim through the uterus to fertilize an egg. Effectiveness: Studies have found that when the gel is used alone, it’s effective as birth control more than 8 out of 10 times. Pros and cons. The gel works immediately and it’s effective for up to an hour after you apply it. But you’ll have to use it each time you have sex, even if it is within the hour you applied the first time. The vaginal gel can only prevent pregnancy. It doesn’t provide any protection against STIs. The gel may also cause a few side effects, such as: Irritation, burning, or itching within the vaginal walls. Studies have found that 1 in 10 partners might have irritation or burning from the gel."

This surgical procedure, also called tubal ligation or “tying tubes,'' is a permanent nonhormonal birth control option. Your fallopian tubes are tied so that the egg has no possibility to meet a sperm for fertilization. The surgery is done at a hospital or a surgical clinic. You may go home the same day, and it’s immediately effective. The failure rate is less than 1%. If you’re interested, talk to your doctor about sterilization and if it’s right for you. Vasectomy. It’s a simple procedure in which the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the penis are cut. This stops sperm from traveling through the tube (called the vas deferens) into the semen or out of the penis. But the surgery doesn’t stop you from being able to have an erection or ejaculate."
