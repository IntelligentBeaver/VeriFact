        "To tell the two apart, you’ll need to take a close look at the differences in those patches, or plaques. Psoriasis starts as rough, red, scaly skin and grows into thick, usually silver-colored scales on top of those areas. These patches often show up on the scalp. You can also get them on your torso, limbs, hands, and feet.",
        "Seborrheic dermatitis patches are more likely to vary in color. They may look whitish-yellow, red, or brown. They also tend to feel greasy or oily (the condition gets its name from the sebaceous, or oily, glands in the skin). This form of dermatitis, or inflammation of the skin, strikes most often on the scalp, on oily parts of the face (like the folds around the nose or in the ears and eyebrows), and on the upper chest and back. Think of it as dandruff 2.0. Simple dandruff causes only flakes, no inflammation, and it’s only on the scalp.",
        "It’s tricky to figure out which condition is which when the flaky red patches are only on the scalp, with no other clues. It’s also possible to have both conditions at the same time. That’s called sebopsoriasis, and it can leave you with white and silver flakes."
