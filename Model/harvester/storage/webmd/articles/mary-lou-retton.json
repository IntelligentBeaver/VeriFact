She also won silver medals for Team and Vault, and bronze medals for Uneven Bars and Floor Exercise. Her five medals were the most won by any athlete at the '84 Olympics. Retton's Olympic performance and winning smile made her \"America's Sweetheart.\"",

She is a spokesperson for a national educational program sponsored by Pfizer that aims to raise awareness of overactive bladder (OAB) and encourage sufferers to seek proper diagnosis and treatment.
