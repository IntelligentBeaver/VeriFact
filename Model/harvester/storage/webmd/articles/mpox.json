        "Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) is a viral disease from the same family as smallpox, though its symptoms usually aren't as serious. Scientists have known about it since 1958, when it was found in lab monkeys used for research. Mpox is most common in Central and West Africa. But in May 2022, health officials began reporting an outbreak of the virus in several regions outside Africa.",
        "As of late July 2022, the CDC had confirmed almost 2,900 cases of mpox and a related virus in the U.S. That was up from 35 confirmed cases in early June. The agency had confirmed over 16,800 cases of mpox worldwide as of late July, up from over 1,000 cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in early June.",
        "On July 23, 2022, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the fast-spreading outbreak to be “a public health emergency of international concern.”",
        "The WHO says an international public health emergency is an “extraordinary event” that poses a serious public health risk. It’s different from a pandemic, like the one caused by the coronavirus. A pandemic is a global outbreak of a virus that infects large numbers of people and causes a high number of deaths, often disrupting daily life and causing general hardship.",
        "Mpox is a zoonotic virus, which means it spreads from animals to humans. In addition to monkeys, it's been found in other primates and certain rodents in Africa. But people can transmit it to each other, too. The first known human infection was in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
