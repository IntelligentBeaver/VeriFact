        "Imbruvica was studied in people with CLL or SLL who were 65 and older and did not receive any prior treatment for their leukemia. People in this study got either Imbruvica or chemotherapy. This study looked at progression-free survival (PFS), which measured how long people lived without progression of their cancer or death. It also looked at overall survival (OS), which measured how long people lived, and overall response rate (ORR), which measured the amount of people who had a complete or partial response. There were 269 patients in this study. The median age was 73 and most of the people were at least 70 years old (70%). Sixty-five percent of people in the Imbruvica group were male and 61% in the chemotherapy group were male. The PFS rate at 18 months was 90% in the Imbruvica group and 52% in the chemotherapy group. This means that people taking Imbruvica lived significantly longer without progression than those in the chemotherapy group. OS was also significantly improved in the Imbruvica group with 98% of people still alive at 24 months versus 85% in the chemotherapy group. People in the Imbruvica group had an ORR of 86% and people in the chemotherapy group had an ORR of 35%.",
        "Imbruvica was also studied in combination with a chemotherapy medicine called bendamustine, plus rituximab for people with CLL and SLL. People in this study either got Imbruvica plus bendamustine and rituximab (BR) or placebo plus BR. People in this study had relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL that had been treated with at least one other treatment for their cancer. The study looked at PFS, as well as OS and ORR. There were 578 people in this study. Ages ranged from 31 to 86, and the median age was 64. Sixty-seven percent of people in the Imbruvica/BR group were male, and 65% of people in the BR group were male. Most of the people in both groups had CLL (89%). After 60 months, the PFS in the Imbruvica/BR group was 52.7% versus 8.2% in the BR group. At 5 years, the median PFS was significantly longer in the Imbruvica/BR group at 65.1 versus 14.3 in the BR group. This means that half the people in the Imbruvica/BR group lived at least 65.1 months and half the people in the BR group lived at least 14.3 months without their cancers progressing. The OS rate was 75.7% for the Imbruvica/BR group versus 61.2% for the BR group. This means that people that received Imbruvica plus BR lived longer than those that got BR alone.

Ninety-six percent of people in this study were white, 2% were Black or African American, 1% were Asian, and 1% were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. The median PFS at 42 months was 74% in the Imbruvica group versus 33% in the chemotherapy group.

About 67% of the people were male. At three years, the PFS for the Imbruvica was 89.4% as compared to 72.9% in the chemotherapy group. The OS was also higher in the Imbruvica group versus the chemotherapy group at 98.8% versus 91.5%. This shows that Imbruvica given with rituximab improved both PFS and OS in CLL and SLL patients without prior treatment."

This study looked at PFS as well as OS. There were 529 people in this trial; 354 people were in the Imbruvica group and 175 people were in the chemotherapy group. The median age for this study was 57 and the ages ranged from 49 to 64. About 67% of the people were male. At three years, the PFS for the Imbruvica was 89.4% as compared to 72.9% in the chemotherapy group. The OS was also higher in the Imbruvica group versus the chemotherapy group at 98.8% versus 91.5%.

This study measured PFS as well as ORR. There were 229 people in this study and they were evenly split between the two groups. The median age was 71, ranging from 40 to 87, with most patients (80%) being 65 or older. Fifty-nine percent in the Imbruvica group and 68% in the chemotherapy group were men. Ninety-six percent of people in this study were white, 2% were Black or African American, 1% were Asian, and 1% were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. The median PFS at 42 months was 74% in the Imbruvica group versus 33% in the chemotherapy group.
