        "By Charlotte Laycock, as told to Keri Wiginton One year before I summited one of the world’s tallest mountains, a doctor told me I might never exercise again. Unlike most people, I didn’t start climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro with the summit in mind. That’s because I have myasthenia gravis (MG). And while my disease is fairly stable these days, MG is unpredictable. My goal was to put one foot in front of the other each day. I can’t easily describe what it felt like to look out on the world from a height of nearly 20,000 feet. There was some relief and exhaustion. Not MG exhaustion, just normal human tiredness. And I had a sense of elation. I’d just smashed everyone’s expectations, including my own."

And for a while I just worked around my weakness, thinking one day I’d wake up feeling better. I found that midday exercise boosted my strength. Most days I’d go for a run, followed by a big lunch. But then one night I ate a bowl of mussels. And when I swallowed, the mussel juice came out of my nose instead of going down my throat. That’s when I realized I was in trouble and needed medical help. The first doctor I saw agreed with my original thought about stress. No one mentioned MG. They urged me to go on holiday, which I did.

Because my first question to her was, “Can I exercise?” And she assured me that running or climbing mountains or doing HIIT classes wouldn’t hurt my muscles. I could do whatever activities felt good for me, she said, but I should stop if I got tired. The only thing she told me not to do is climb Mt. Everest, which I think is fair enough.",

You’re past the point where a helicopter could pick you up and fly you to safety. But even if someone could’ve helped me off the mountain, I was in Tanzania.
