        "Jordan S. Josephson, MD, is an internationally renowned nasal and endoscopic sinus surgeon.  He attended medical school at SUNY Health Science Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., and did his residency training in otolaryngology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center. He finished the first fellowship in rhinology and endoscopic sinus surgery Johns Hopkins Hospital. He is certified by the American Board of Otolaryngology. He was a consultant to the National Institutes of Health for six years where he did research on Wegener's granulomatosis and nasal and sinus disease.",
        "Josephson is in private practice in Manhattan. He is affiliated with Lenox Hill Hospital, Manhattan Eye, Ear & Throat Hospital, and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He treats patients with difficult sinus disease, allergies, asthma, GERD, snoring/sleep apnea, and nasal deformities leading to airway obstruction. He performs nasal surgery including rhinoplasty for nasal breathing and deformity problems. Josephson utilizes a combination of the best of Eastern and Western medicine treatments to treat the most complicated cases. Beyond the traditional clinical treatment of his patients, he actively participates in the latest research and uses this knowledge as a medical educator, lecturing around the world.",
        "He has recently written a book for the public titled Sinus Relief Now on sinus disease, allergies, asthma, snoring, sleep apnea, and GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), which he believes are all related inflammatory diseases. He has coined the term CAID -- chronic airway-digestive inflammatory disease -- to describe this process.",
        "Josephson has appeared on Oprah and was featured in New York Magazine as one of 13 innovators in medicine. He is listed as one of Castle Connolly's “Top Doctors in the United States.”",
