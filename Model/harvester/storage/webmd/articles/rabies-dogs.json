        "If your dog is bitten by another animal and you’re worried about rabies, pay close attention to their behavior and call your vet immediately if you have reason to suspect rabies.",
        "Your dog may quickly become restless and irritable, even showing aggression . Rabid animals may also be uncharacteristically affectionate. Similarly, if your dog is usually excited and happy, they may suddenly seem relaxed and disinterested. Physical signs of rabies in dogs to watch for include fever , difficulty swallowing, excessive drooling, staggering, seizures, and even paralysis.",
        "As the virus progresses, your dog may act as though they are overstimulated, meaning lights, movement, and sound may appear to have a negative effect. They may seek out a dark, quiet place to hide or act aggressively.",
        "One of the most well-known symptoms of rabies in dogs is foaming at the mouth. Some dogs may not show “foaming” but simply excess saliva or drooling. This is a sign that the virus has progressed. In the final stages of rabies, seizures and increasing paralysis are common. Dogs in this stage can’t control their muscles — especially in their head and throat — which makes swallowing difficult. Eventually, breathing isn’t possible, which leads to death.",
        "The virus can be in your dog’s body for weeks before signs develop. Most cases in dogs develop within 21 to 80 days after exposure, but the incubation period can be much shorter or longer. Once rabies shows symptoms, it can’t be treated, so it’s important to call your vet as soon as your dog has been bitten, instead of waiting to see."
