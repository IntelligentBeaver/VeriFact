        "Acute hepatic porphyria , or AHP , is a group of rare genetic conditions that affect how the body makes a natural substance called heme. Heme is produced in the liver and is essential for many important functions, including carrying oxygen in the blood. In people with AHP, a key enzyme in the heme-making process called delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase ( ALA S1) leads to harmful substances called aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) to build up in the liver and throughout your body.",
        "In people with AHP, both ALA and PBG are linked to sudden, severe \"attacks\" of illness and other symptoms of the disease. During an attack, the most common symptom is intense stomach pain, but symptoms vary from person to person and may change over time.",
        "Givlaari (givosiran) was approved by the FDA in 2019 for adults with AHP. The medicine works by preventing the overproduction of ALAS1, thereby lowering the risk of attacks and reducing the long-term problems that come with this disease."
