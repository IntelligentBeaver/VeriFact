        "When you hear people talk about substance abuse, most of us think of drugs and alcohol. Most people don’t even think of food as being a substance that we can abuse. But our feelings can cause us to lose control of our food choices until they become just that. Emotional eating is a way to calm or suppress these negative feelings, such as anger, stress, fear, sadness, loneliness, and boredom.",
        "It’s different for everyone, but major life changes, the struggles of daily life, and unresolved traumas may trigger you into emotional eating. When this happens, food choices may include foods that are not so healthy. This can lead to higher blood glucose levels, especially for people living with diabetes.",
        "I’ve had my own struggles with emotional eating ever since I could remember. My food choices, eating frequency, and food portions were often determined by how I felt when it was time to eat. This happened with extreme emotions on both ends of the spectrum. If I was really sad, upset, or stressed, I would eat, and it would never be anything healthy. Also, if I was really happy and in a celebratory mood, I would celebrate with food, and this too was never with anything good for me."
