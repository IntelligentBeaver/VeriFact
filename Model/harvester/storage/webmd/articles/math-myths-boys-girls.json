        "“There has been a lot of lore around the potential of boys and girls, but it really hadn’t been tested at the neurobiological level,” says Jessica Cantlon, PhD, a professor of developmental neuroscience at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. “We’re finding that the science doesn’t align with the folk beliefs.”",
        "For one recent study, Cantlon used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan the brain activity of 104 children, ages 3 to 10, while they watched educational videos and did math problems. When they compared which brain regions lit up, how much, and in what patterns, they found no statistical differences between boys and girls. And when they assessed the children’s level of brain maturity, specifically in areas associated with math, boys and girls were similar."
