        "Although many people struggle with drowsiness and getting enough sleep at some point in their lives, some people have sleep disorders that cause chronic (long-term) issues with sleep. These types of sleep disorders are caused by changes in the way that the brain processes and responds to sleep.",
        "One of these disorders, narcolepsy , causes extreme sleepiness during the day and difficulty focusing or staying awake. As a result, many people with narcolepsy experience sleep attacks in which they fall asleep without warning, even if they are in the middle of an activity. Some people with narcolepsy also experience something called cataplexy . During a cataplexy attack, a person suddenly loses muscle control. This can cause all types of issues depending on which muscles are affected, from drooping eyelids, to difficulty speaking, to not being able to move at all."

        "Getting more sleep at night does not help with these symptoms, so treatment may include different types of medicines. One type of medicine that is often used to treat narcolepsy is sodium oxybate, or gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). This medicine is taken at night and seems to change the way the brain responds to sleep so that a person feels less tired during the day. However, it can cause serious side effects and carries a high risk of abuse or misuse, so there are restrictions on prescribing and taking this medicine.",

The active ingredient in Wakix, called pitolisant, blocks a certain receptor in the brain called the histamine-3 (H3) receptor. This forces a chemical called histamine to bind to other receptors in the brain instead, changing the way that the brain regulates sleep and wakefulness."
