        "Tic disorders are conditions involving your nervous system. They cause you to make repetitive, sudden, rapid sounds or movements, and you may struggle to control yourself when they happen. These disorders affect 1 in 5 children at some point. Tics usually start between ages 4 and 6, and symptoms are most noticeable between 10 and 12 years old.",
        "Tic disorders include Tourette syndrome, persistent or chronic tic disorder, and provisional tic disorder. If you have tics, you're more likely to have other mental health conditions, including depression , bipolar disorder, substance use disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety disorders, and learning disorders.",
        "Sometimes, tics get better over time or go away completely. But they may also be long-lasting.",
