Clots can form either in the brain's blood vessels, in blood vessels leading to the brain, or even blood vessels elsewhere in the body that travel to the brain. These clots block blood flow to the brain's cells, choking off oxygen to a part of the brain . Without oxygen, brain cells first go into shock and then start dying. So the longer you go without stroke treatment, the greater the damage to your brain . Ischemic strokes can also happen when too much plaque (fatty deposits and cholesterol) clogs the brain's blood vessels. These are the most common type of stroke. About 80% of strokes are ischemic.",
        "Hemorrhagic strokes happen when a blood vessel in the brain breaks or ruptures. The result is blood seeping into the brain, causing damage to brain cells. While less common, these strokes can be more devastating. Although the cause is different from an ischemic stroke, the result is the same: Brain cells can't get the blood they need. More than 60% of people who have a hemorrhagic stroke die within a year, and those who survive tend to be much more disabled. The most common causes of hemorrhagic stroke are high blood pressure and brain aneurysms. An aneurysm is a weakness or thinness in the blood vessel wall."
