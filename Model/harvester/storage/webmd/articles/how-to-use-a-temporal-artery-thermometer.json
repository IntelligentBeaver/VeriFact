        "A temporal artery thermometer (TAT) measures the heat energy your body gives off in your temporal artery. It's a blood vessel that runs across the middle of your forehead. To use a temporal artery thermometer, you'll place the device in the center of your forehead before gently moving it straight across to your hairline.",
        "The temporal artery thermometer uses infrared technology to measure your temperature. Everything is made of atoms that move around and send out energy. And when your temperature is higher, these atoms move faster. The thermometer can read this movement as infrared energy or heat. The device converts the heat to a temperature.",
        "The temporal thermometer gives you a readout of your body temperature and can quickly tell you if you have a fever. A body temperature of 100.9 F or higher signals a fever, but some experts say a fever starts at 100.4 F or higher. For an infant, this temperature is more of a concern than it may be for an adult.",
        "Although rectal thermometers are the most precise, inserting a thermometer into your butt (anus) can cause discomfort. A temporal reading can give you a quick, easy way to know if you have a higher temperature. Explore when to use this thermometer and learn about the pros and cons of measuring your temporal artery temperature."
