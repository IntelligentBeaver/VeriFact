        "March 13, 2024 – People with essential tremor are nearly three times as likely to develop dementia compared to the general population, new research shows.",
        "In the new study, nearly 20% of older adults with essential tremor had dementia. However, the rates were lower than those seen in adults with Parkinson’s disease.",
        "The study is “the most complete exposition of the longitudinal trajectory of cognitive impairment in an ET cohort,” say the authors, led by Elan D. Louis, MD, MSc, from University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.",
        "Cognitive Issues Nearly Double",
        "For the study, 222 adults (average age at the beginning of the study was 79) with essential tremor underwent detailed cognitive tests and were followed for an average of 5 years.",
        "At the beginning of the study, 168 people had normal cognitive skills, 35 had mild cognitive impairment and 19 had dementia. During follow up, 59 individuals developed cognitive issues  and 41 dveloped dementia.",
        "During follow up, the total rate of dementia was 18.5% and 12.2% of participants moved from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. The overall rate of dementia among patients with tremor is roughly 300% greater than that among people in the general population, and 50% greater than that reported for adults with Parkinson's disease."
