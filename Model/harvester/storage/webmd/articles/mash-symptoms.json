Plenty of people have fat in their liver cells, which is a common condition called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Many people with MASLD never know it because the condition may not cause problems. However, you can develop MASH if large amounts of fat collect in your liver. MASH can cause serious health problems, such as inflammation and scarring in the liver. If left untreated, MASH can cause liver failure.",
