If you find yourself having difficulty falling asleep or sleeping through the night, this could be a sign of insomnia. Insomnia is a sleep disorder that makes it hard for you to fall asleep or stay asleep.",

If your body doesn’t have enough proper rest, it can affect your mood and ability to concentrate.
