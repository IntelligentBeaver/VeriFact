        "At 21 months, Megan far exceeded every developmental milestone for her age group. She spoke in sentences. She knew her colors. She could count to 20. But then, over a period of just a few weeks, Megan suddenly stopped talking.",

        "Fortunately, the Prestons had moved to New York, a state that requires mandatory blood lead testing of children at both 12 and 24 months of age. Megan's level came back at 26 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) -- a number that doctors consider extremely dangerous for young children. A second test, performed two weeks later at Preston's insistence, showed a blood lead level of 32 mcg/dL.",
        "According to Preston, health officials determined that the source of Megan's poisoning was crayons she had been eating."
