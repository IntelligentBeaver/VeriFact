        "Compartment syndrome occurs when excessive pressure builds up inside an enclosed muscle space in the body. The condition usually results from bleeding or swelling after an injury. The dangerously high pressure in compartment syndrome slows the flow of blood, oxygen, and nutrients to and from the affected tissues. It can be an emergency, requiring surgery to prevent permanent injury.",
        "Acute compartment syndrome vs. chronic compartment syndrome",
        "Acute compartment syndrome is the most common type of compartment syndrome. About three-quarters of the time, acute compartment syndrome is caused by a broken leg or arm. Acute compartment syndrome develops rapidly over hours or days. It is also the most severe type. If left untreated, it can result in loss of function or amputation of the affected area.",
        "Chronic compartment syndrome develops over days or weeks. Also called exertional compartment syndrome, it may be caused by regular, vigorous exercise such as running, swimming, or biking. Exercise-induced compartment syndrome tends to flare up when you do any exercise that causes swelling, such as running, and then goes down when you are done. This is usually less severe than acute compartment syndrome and may just limit the duration and intensity of the exercise. It usually involves the lower leg, buttock, or thighs."
