        "If you’re 65 or older, you may need to adjust the types of medications you use. Some issues to consider: Topical treatments can cause new side effects as you get older. Though topical psoriasis treatments like corticosteroids and topical vitamin D are usually considered safe for older adults, they may cause new issues. Tell your doctor if you notice purple spots on your skin, if your skin looks transparent, or if you notice signs of infection such as redness or areas that are inflamed or warm to the touch. Topicals may be harder to apply as you age. You should also let your doctor know if you have joint swelling or flexibility issues that make it hard to apply topical medications to your psoriasis plaques. Some oral or injected medications may be harder for your body to process. Your kidneys don’t work as well as you age. That means they remove less waste from your body. Because of that, medications that work throughout your body, like methotrexate , can build up in your system and cause problems. If you’re taking these medications, your doctor will need to monitor you closely. They may recommend another treatment or ask you to work with a kidney specialist to make sure you’re staying safe."
