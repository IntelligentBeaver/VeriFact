        "Homeopathy, or homeopathic medicine, is a medical system started in Germany. It aims to treat the whole person instead of just the disease or symptom.",
        "This system of medicine is based on two main beliefs. The first is that “like cures like.” This is the idea that you can treat a disease with a natural substance that causes symptoms of that disease when a healthy person takes it. The second is the “law of minimum dose.” Homeopathic remedies are watered down (diluted) to give you the lowest dose possible. Sometimes the treatment is so diluted that there may be no trace of the original substance.",
        "Homeopathic practitioners describe their medicines as all natural. The ingredients come from plants, minerals, or animals. These remedies are available as ointments, creams, drops, tablets, and sugar pellets. There are no one-size-fits-all guidelines; each individual gets a unique treatment plan. A homeopathic practitioner may give different remedies and dilutions to different people with the same condition."
