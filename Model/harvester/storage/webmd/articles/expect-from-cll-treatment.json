Aim to eat healthy, mostly plant-based foods. If you don’t feel like eating, you may do better with small snacks throughout the day. Regular exercise is also key. It can help you handle symptoms like pain, fatigue, and depression. Choosing healthy habits can help make you feel better overall and live fully with CLL.",
