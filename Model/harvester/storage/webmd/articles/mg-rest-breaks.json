        "When you have myasthenia gravis (MG), it can be hard just to breathe or hold your head up. You might feel weak or like your body is not the one you used to know. It’s especially hard at first if you’re trying to find a treatment regimen that works. It’s natural to feel like you want to keep working or doing all the things you used to do, whether it’s work, a fun activity, or household chores. But it’s important to listen to your body and make sure you don’t overdo it. When you’re tired , stop and take a nap. Give yourself a chance to rest, even if it’s just 10 or 20 minutes. Read on to learn more about the importance of rest and get tips on how to work enough rest into your day."

        "Myasthenia gravis has muscle weakness that comes and goes. You may feel it first in your face and especially in your eyes. From there, it can spread to other parts of your body. Not everyone is the same, but you may notice that your tiredness and weakness get worse with certain triggers, including heat and stress. That’s why it’s so important to take breaks and make sure you’re generally getting the rest you need."

        "When it comes to getting rest, it’s important to think not only about resting physically but also mentally. Pushing your body too hard can leave you feeling weak. Pushing your mind too hard with lots of stress at work or at home also can take a toll. Some ways to sneak in rest include: Avoid rushing as much as you can by planning ahead. But remember, it’s also OK to be late sometimes. If the people in your life can run an errand or make a task easier for you, ask them. Plan to get more sleep than you used to need. Take naps, and don’t feel guilty about it. If you read a lot or work on the computer, get up regularly to rest your eyes. If certain activities really wear you out, try to avoid them or plan for extra rest before and after. When life happens, try deep breaths or visualization techniques to work in essential moments of rest. By working rest into your day, you can find ways to still do what you love even while managing your MG. But be patient with yourself. It may take time and trial and error to adjust and find what works for you."
