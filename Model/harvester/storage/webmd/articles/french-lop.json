French lops can be heavier than they look and could easily be dropped by a child.",
        "Diet and exercise. Because French lop rabbits are a large breed, they need more food than the average rabbit. Most of their diet, 70%, should be hay. A good rule is to feed them their body size in hay every day. Hay is important because it keeps their digestive system regular and grinds down their teeth to prevent overgrowth. Timothy hay is best for French lops.",

This can be inside or outside. Since they’ll stick by your side, consider having them with you while you’re gardening or playing with your kids outside."
