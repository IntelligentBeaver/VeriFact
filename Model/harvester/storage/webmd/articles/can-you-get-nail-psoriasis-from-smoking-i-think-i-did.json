        "I’ve never smoked cigarettes or any tobacco products. However, recently I played around with CBD and herbal smoke blends. I loved the effects of both CBD and the herbal blends I created, but I quickly noticed a change in the health of my fingernails. I wasn’t quite sure what was causing it until I started paying more attention to my habits. When I realized smoking could be the cause, I took a break and reintroduced it later. My nails became brittle, little lines would appear, and I even noticed a bit of pitting as well.",
        "Throughout my life, I’ve always had strong, healthy nails. Seeing a shift in the health of my nails was very new and frustrating for me. I remember hearing about nail psoriasis, but it wasn’t until my personal experience with these symptoms that I decided to do some research on it. Nail psoriasis is actually common, with more than half of psoriasis patients and more than 80% of psoriatic arthritis patients are affected."
