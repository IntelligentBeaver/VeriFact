        "Every morning when Jennifer Jacome’s 8-year-old daughter, Aelin, heads off to school, she grabs a special backpack. “It contains a skin kit that has all the essentials she needs to manage her atopic dermatitis : moisturizer, a gentle cleanser to wash her hands with at school, wipes for her face to remove pollen when she goes outdoors for recess, and her EpiPen, since she has food allergies ,” says Jacome, a public relations executive in Houston, Texas. “We let her pick out all the skin care products in there to give her a sense of control.” School or day care can be tricky for any kid, but it can be particularly challenging for children or teens with atopic dermatitis, often known as eczema. More than a million school-age children in the U.S. have severe atopic dermatitis, according to the National Eczema Association. If they have a flare-up, other kids and even teachers may think the rash is contagious. They may get teased or bullied. If they were up the night before because of itching , they may be too tired to fully participate in school."

        "When it comes to clothing, cotton is best for kids with atopic dermatitis. “It does a good job of absorbing sweat , and it’s light enough to allow skin to ‘breathe,’” says Jessica Chacko, MD, a pediatrician at Blooming Bright Pediatrics in Lithia, Florida, whose son, Noah, has severe atopic dermatitis. If your child is active, consider a moisture wicking fabric like Dri-FIT. “My daughter lives in Dri-FIT shorts year-round since they’re so soft and comfortable,” says Jacome. It’s also a good idea to always send them with several changes of clothes, says Chacko, especially if they are an infant or toddler and prone to messes. “If their clothes get dirty and they borrow some, their skin may get irritated by whatever detergent they’ve been washed with,” she explains. Older kids and teens who play sports may also need to take some precautions. “If they have to put on equipment like shin guards, they should coat their skin with a thick petroleum-based moisturizer such as Aquaphor,” advises Chacko. “It will prevent their sensitive skin from getting torn up from friction.” They should also shower immediately after all practices or games to wash away sweat that can be an atopic dermatitis trigger, followed by an atopic dermatitis-friendly moisturizer."
