        "One advantage to CAR T-cell therapy is that you only need to have it once. That's different from chemotherapy and radiation, which need several treatments.",
        "T cells find these foreign substances by looking for proteins on their surface. Each T cell has its own protein, called a receptor, that helps it attach to a cancer cell and destroy it. Once a T cell finds a cancer cell, its receptor latches onto the antigen on the cancer cell's surface, just like a key fits into a lock.",
        "CAR T-cell therapy adds a man-made receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor to your T cells in a lab, to help them find your cancer more easily. The lab multiplies the modified T cells into the hundreds of millions. Then they go back into your body. The CAR T cells target an antigen called CD19 on your lymphoma cells."
