It also helps with their thinking skills, so they can learn more at school.

Researchers have found that physical activity improved sleep quality and length among kids with ADHD. There are a few reasons why it's useful: It relieves stress and anxiety that can make it hard to sleep. Exercise itself raises levels of feel-good hormones in your child ' s brain. It tires them out. The more active your child is, the more it wears their body out so that it ' s easier for them to fall asleep. It helps to reset your child ' s body clock. If your child exercises outdoors, natural light helps their body establish a good sleep-wake cycle – when it ' s time for them to wake up, and when it ' s time for them to wind down."

Research does show that there may be certain types of exercise that are especially good for kids with ADHD. Several studies have found that cognitive-aerobic activities like playing a game while you exercise work best in children with ADHD to boost working memory. That's the type of memory that allows you to hold and use information over a short period of time. Ball sports, like soccer, football, or basketball, were also very effective. All these activities involve multitasking, which means your child must use several parts of their brain at once."
