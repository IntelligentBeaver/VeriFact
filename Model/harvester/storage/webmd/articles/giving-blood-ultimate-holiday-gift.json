        "What is a special present that could come only from you? You may not have thought of this: The greatest gift you can give another human is, literally, life. Donating blood even once can help save the lives of three people -- whether they're newborns needing heart surgery, adults badly injured in car crashes, or people of any age suffering from cancer .",
        "If you already donate, you probably know how important it is. If you don't donate, you're hardly alone. While 60% of Americans are eligible to give blood, only 5% of them do -- even though someone in America needs a blood transfusion every two seconds. \"At any given time, we only have a three-day supply of blood in this country. It's vitally important that people give,\" says Anne Eder, MD, executive medical officer of the American Red Cross.",
