        "If you’re wondering how to rehydrate fast, the best way is to drink water. An oral rehydration solution (ORS) that has water plus electrolytes such as sodium and potassium is another good dehydration treatment. It quickly replaces lost fluids and electrolytes and helps keep your body’s fluid balance healthy.",
        "Sports drinks are also good for dehydration. Their sugar helps your body absorb water, and their sweet taste can make you drink more.",
        "For mild dehydration, water or an electrolyte solution could be enough treatment. “In more urgent cases, such as heat illness or vomiting, IV [given through a vein] fluids may be needed to rehydrate quickly,” says Lauri Wright, PhD, director of nutrition programs and associate professor at the University of South Florida College of Public Health.",

        "Mild dehydration. To manage mild dehydration, drink two to three cups (16 to 24 ounces) of water every hour. Sip it slowly so you don’t upset your stomach. Fruit juices or sports drinks are also fine. The sugar in these drinks helps your body absorb water and makes them taste better, so you’ll want to drink more.",
        "Moderate dehydration. “If you’re sweating a lot or have diarrhea or vomiting, oral rehydration solutions work better than water alone,” Wright says. These solutions have sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate to replace lost electrolytes and help your body absorb more water. Drink four to eight cups in the first four hours. Then drink as much water and other liquids as you need to stay hydrated.",
        "Serious dehydration. Little or no pee, dry skin, confusion, or dizziness are signs of serious dehydration. Go to an urgent care center or hospital right away. You’ll get IV fluids (given through a vein) to quickly restore the balance of fluid and electrolytes in your body."
