He left the scene of the serious crash thinking how lucky he was that he hadn't been hurt. \"And then four to six weeks later, I started noticing twitches in the muscles of my neck and upper back. These progressed to marked spasms of my neck, shoulders, and upper back,\" he recalls.",

His doctors tried a variety of treatments -- massage , physical therapy , and muscle relaxants -- yet not one of them offered him pain medicine to relieve his constant agony. \"Nobody, despite this tremendous pain, offered me a pain pill, even though I wasn't sleeping and I was losing weight,\" he says."
