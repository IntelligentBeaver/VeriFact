        "EDS can impact work in many ways, including concentration, memory, and the ability to stay awake to perform your duties. Some people with sleep disorders may qualify for reasonable workplace accommodations under the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). These are changes to your job or work environment that help you carry out your duties without causing your employer hardship. Small employers with less than 15 workers aren’t usually required to provide reasonable accommodations, but state and local laws may override this. You and your employer will work together to figure out accommodations. Examples for people with EDS include: Time and a quiet space to take a nap Activity breaks to keep you alert A flexible work schedule or a different shift Using paid or unpaid leave to make up for time missed from work Working from home Employer-paid transportation if you can’t drive safely Recorded meetings Special equipment, such as a standing desk, to help you stay awake Reassigning less critical tasks to co-workers Standing during meetings A desk near a window for natural light The ADA doesn’t offer a specific list of medical conditions that qualify as disabilities. Instead, the law defines a person with a disability as someone who has a physical or mental impairment that greatly limits one or more major life activities and has a history or record of the impairment. For advice and more information, contact an employment or disability lawyer."
