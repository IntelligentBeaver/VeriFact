        "Rice vinegar is a lightly sweet and sour vinegar that’s often used in Asian cooking. All it takes to make rice vinegar is to ferment the rice in water to produce alcohol. This rice alcohol is then fermented again into acetic acid. This results in a sour liquid that is commonly added to a number of dishes, including sushi.",
        "Like most types of vinegar, rice vinegar is very acidic. This can benefit your health, but it can also cause problems. Most types of vinegar affect your health in similar ways because the fermentation process leads to the breakdown of different grains or fruits used to make the vinegar. So, while folk remedies that involve rice vinegar are common, further studies need to be done to investigate many of its purported health benefits."
