        "Insulin resistance is when cells in your muscles, fat, and liver don’t respond well to insulin, a hormone made by your pancreas that helps manage your blood glucose (blood sugar). Sometimes, insulin resistance is a short-term condition. But if left untreated for a long time, it could turn into diabetes.",
        "Your body's main source of fuel is glucose, which it gets by breaking down the food you eat. Once glucose enters your bloodstream, insulin helps it get into your cells, where it's either used or stored for later. That signals your pancreas to stop making insulin .",
        "But if you have insulin resistance, this process doesn't work well. Your cells aren't letting glucose in when insulin \"asks\" them to. As a result, more and more blood glucose piles up in your bloodstream. And your pancreas keeps making insulin.",
        "For a while, your pancreas may be able to make so much extra insulin that your cells open up and let in glucose the way they're supposed to. That will keep your blood sugar within a normal range. But over time, your cells may become more insulin resistant and your blood glucose levels could keep rising."
