        "You'll feel costochondritis pain in the upper ribs on the left side of your chest. Right-side chest pain is often caused by a lung problem, such as pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). Costochondritis is a form of noncardiac chest pain, meaning that it's not caused by a heart problem.",
        "About 13% of people who see a doctor about chest pain have costochondritis. The condition affects both children and adults but is more common in people aged 40 or older. It's more likely to affect women and people of Hispanic origin.",
        "Is costochondritis dangerous?",
        "This condition is mostly harmless. But if you have sudden chest pain, always have it checked out by a doctor to make sure your heart is healthy. Unlike costochondritis, a heart attack often causes widespread pain along with symptoms such as sweating, nausea, and a hard time breathing.",
        "Injury, physical strain, respiratory infection, rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis , chest wall infections, tumors, or rare conditions such as relapsing polychondritis may also cause chest pain."
