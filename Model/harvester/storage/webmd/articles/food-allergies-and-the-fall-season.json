        "Kids’ joys can be simple, and they typically want to spend time with family and/or friends. Some of our favorite fall traditions are raking and jumping in leaves, shopping at the farmers market, attending at least one football game, adding fall season décor, and most importantly, changing the smells in our home to pumpkin and apple scents. We have different traditions throughout the year because this takes the focus away from food. Although food is included, the experience is about much more. My girls, now ages 9 and 7, look forward to all of this and do not let me forget it, ha! Be sure to create your own traditions as well.",
        "Fall Comfort Foods",
        "With a little creativity, many seasonal favorites can be enjoyed in allergen-free versions. For example, you can use gluten-free flour, dairy-free butter, dairy-free whipped cream, egg-free pie crust, or dairy-free milk. Oats or seeds can replace nuts in recipes, and pies can be made without eggs. Your favorite snickerdoodle and gingerbread cookies can be made with safe ingredients. Most importantly, my favorite – pumpkin – is not one of the top nine common allergens."

You may need to consider gluten-free dressing, dairy-free mashed potatoes, allergy-friendly sweet potato souffle, or nut-free desserts.
