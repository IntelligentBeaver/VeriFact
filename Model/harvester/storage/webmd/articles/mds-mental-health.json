        "When you or your loved one is diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), it can be hard to process. MDS, a type of cancer in which the blood-forming cells in bone marrow are abnormal or don’t work right, is a complicated disease to understand. That in itself can make you feel stressed and anxious. It also has an uncertain prognosis, which can be even more emotionally challenging. To help you better understand the impact MDS can have on your mental health and how to manage it, these experts will share their tips on what to look for and what helps most."

        "When people get diagnosed with MDS, they've usually never even heard of it. While the reality of cancer can be life-changing, not being familiar with the condition can put more strain on your mental health. Most often, that means anxiety, distress, and depression . If you have high-risk MDS, functional issues, or a transfusion dependency, you may have a higher chance of anxiety and depression. These mental stressors can not only affect you emotionally, but can make fatigue , weakness, and brain fog that come from dealing with the physical symptoms of MDS and its treatment worse. Let’s dive into how these mental health issues may affect you throughout your MDS journey."

        "You may have anxiety because you're concerned about the uncertainty of your treatment, prognosis, and the future. Anxiety can show up as uncontrolled worry, restlessness, or angry outbursts. It could also appear physically in the form of muscle tension, dry mouth , or trembling. Distress. This includes negative feelings ranging from helplessness to uncertainty of your faith, purpose, or meaning in life. A certain amount of distress is totally normal. It's more of an issue when it gets in the way of treatment, makes it hard for you to function or cope, and affects every part of your life. You may have trouble sleeping, eating, or concentrating, and you might have frequent thoughts of illness and death. Depression. Feelings and periods of depression are common if you have MDS and can exist alongside anxiety and distress. These feelings are normal but can become serious if you've been sad for a long time, feel that life is not worth living, or are having trouble carrying out day-to-day activities. You could also have drastic shifts in appetite or sleep patterns."

Knowing what you need can help you pick the right support services. Think about the specific things you're struggling with, how much your emotions bother you, and how you have coped in the past to figure out the best path forward for you. Reach out to your cancer care team about any mental health issues you're having so they can help you find the right support.",
