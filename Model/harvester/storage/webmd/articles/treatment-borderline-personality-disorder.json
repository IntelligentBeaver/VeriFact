        "The most common and effective BPD treatment is psychotherapy, also known as counseling or talk therapy. The main goal is to help you learn how to manage your emotions in healthier ways. For example, instead of reacting to a situation right away, you might learn to pause and recognize what you’re feeling (“I feel very angry right now”), then decide how you want to respond. These kinds of tools can make it easier to manage day-to-day life and relationships."

        "Biases can sometimes affect how doctors diagnose borderline personality disorder. For example, if you come from a culture where people are more expressive, a doctor might misread your emotions as a sign of BPD — even if that’s not the case. On the other hand, if you’re from a culture where showing emotions like anger or sadness isn’t common, BPD might be harder to spot. These cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings or even misdiagnoses, which affect the type of BPD treatment you’ll get.",
        "For many years, researchers believed that BPD was more common in women. That’s because women are more likely to seek mental health care, so they showed up more in studies done on the disorder. But current research shows that BPD affects men and women equally. Despite this, many doctors still misread the symptoms of BPD in men as antisocial behavior or anger, which means they might not get the right diagnosis or support.",
