        "A root canal is a treatment used to repair and save a tooth that is badly decayed or infected. A tooth's nerve and pulp can become irritated, inflamed, and infected due to deep decay; repeated dental procedures on a tooth; or large fillings, a crack, or chip in the tooth. It also can happen because of trauma to the face.",
        "During a root canal procedure, the nerve and pulp of the tooth are removed and the inside is cleaned and sealed. Without treatment, the tissue surrounding the tooth will become infected and an abscess may form.",
        "A tooth's nerve is not vitally important to a tooth's health and function after the tooth has come through the gums and the roots are fully grown. After that, the nerve's only function is sensory -- to give the sensation of hot or cold. The absence of a nerve won’t affect how your tooth works.",

As the work is done, water or sodium hypochlorite will be sprayed in the area to flush away the debris.",

For instance, if there is an infection, your dentist may put a medication inside the tooth to clear it up. Others may choose to seal the tooth the same day it is cleaned out. If the root canal isn’t done on the same day, a temporary filling is placed in the exterior hole in the tooth to keep out saliva and food between appointments.",
        "At the next appointment, to fill the interior of the tooth, a sealer paste and a rubber compound called gutta percha are placed into the root canal. A filling will be put in to close the access hole created at the beginning of treatment.",
        "The final step may involve further restoration of the tooth. A tooth that needs a root canal often is one that has a large filling or extensive decay or other weakness. Because of that, you may need a crown, crown and post, or other restoration to protect it, prevent it from breaking, and restore it to full function. Your dentist will discuss the need for any additional dental work with you."
