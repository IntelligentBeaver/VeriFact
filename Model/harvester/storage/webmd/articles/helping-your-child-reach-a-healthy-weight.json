        "A 10-year-old boy came into my office last week and promptly asked, \"Am I too chubby?\" His mother added, \"I read about BMIs as a way to determine if someone is overweight. What is a BMI anyway? What does it mean?\"",
        "The body mass index, BMI for short, is a calculation that uses height and weight to estimate how much body fat a child has. The result is then compared with those of kids of the same age and gender to determine if the child falls within a healthy weight range. (You can use an online BMI tool to check your child.)",
        "It's worth doing, because a child who is overweight is not only at higher risk for diabetes, hip fractures , obesity as an adult, and other health problems, but his happiness is in jeopardy as well -- as my young patient illustrates. You might think a child doesn't worry about body size until he reaches his teens, but I've noticed younger children are also concerned. In fact, a recent KidsHealth poll found that more than half of kids ages 9 to 13 said they were stressed about their weight ."
