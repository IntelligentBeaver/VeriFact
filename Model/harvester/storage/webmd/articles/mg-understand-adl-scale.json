        "Myasthenia gravis (MG) makes your muscles weak because it impacts how your nerves and muscles work together. It can cause a variety of symptoms including: Muscle weakness Fatigue Droopy eyelids (ptosis) Double vision Difficulty swallowing or speaking You might notice your muscles get weaker throughout the day, so your symptoms can worsen, too. MG is a chronic condition, which means you need ongoing care from your health care provider and team. There’s no cure, but treatments can help you make your symptoms better and improve your quality of life. Symptoms of MG are different for everybody. They’re often hard to track because they can vary every day. They’re often triggered by things like stress, heat, infections, and lack of sleep. But doctors don’t know when you might have a flare-up, or if you’ll go into remission. This makes tracking your symptoms important. One way to track symptoms is with the MG Activities of Daily Living scale, or the MG-ADL."

        "The MG Activities of Daily Living scale (MG-ADL) lets you or your doctor measure and track your MG symptoms using a simple form. It helps your doctor assess how the condition is affecting your life. It includes eight questions, and you score yourself from 0 to 3 on the following activities: Talking Swallowing Chewing Breathing Brushing your hair Getting up from a chair Double vision Eyelid droop Zero means normal and 3 means you’re having severe symptoms. For instance, when you’re grading how your MG affects your talking, you’d give yourself a 0 if your speech is normal; a 1 if you have intermittent slurring or nasal speech; a 2 if you have constant slurring or nasal speech, but others can understand you; and a 3 if your speech is difficult for others to understand. You repeat this for all activities on the scale and add up your numbers to find your results. Your score will fall between 0 and 24. Typically, the higher your score, the more severe your symptoms are, and the greater the limitations on your daily living. Remember that everyone's score is different. How your symptoms compare to someone else’s depends on a lot of factors."

        "For example, you could score a 3 out of 24, which is low. But if you gave yourself a 3 on vision because you’re seeing double, you might have trouble driving compared to someone who scored a 3 because they have difficulty getting out of their chair. A score of 0 or 1 is considered minimal symptom expression (MSE), which means you have few or no symptoms of MG. The MG-ADL Scale score is often used with the Myasthenia Gravis Composite scale (MGC). Both evaluate how severe your symptoms are, but there are differences between the two. The MG-ADL scale is usually self-reported, meaning you rate your symptoms based on the 0 to 3 scale. The MGC score, however, is determined by an examiner based on scores from other tests that evaluate your double vision, eye closure, neck extension, shoulder abduction, and hip flexion. Those tests are the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis-Revised (QMG-R) and Myasthenia Gravis Manual Muscle Testing (MG-MMT). Your examiner will use the scores of those tests, plus your MG-ADL score, to get your MGC score. They determine what changes have occurred as a result of MG."
