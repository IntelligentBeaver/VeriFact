Corticosteroid injections This is the most common treatment for alopecia areata. Your doctor uses a tiny needle to inject corticosteroids into bare patches of your skin. Your dermatologist will give you injections every 4-6 weeks. You may start to see hair regrowth within 4 weeks. But they don’t prevent new hair loss. Side effects are minimal but may include tiny depressions in your skin that get better over time. When you get the injections, you may feel a pinching from the needle and some tingling from the medication. Topical corticosteroids This is a topical treatment that reduces inflammation around your hair follicles. It comes in many different types, strengths, and brands. You can try a cream, foam, lotion, ointment, or solution. If one doesn’t work, ask your doctor about trying another."

You may see results after 6 months of treatment. It works for about 40% of people. The downside is that side effects are common. You may get itching, redness, and a rash where your doctor applies it. You have to keep using the treatment to keep getting results."
