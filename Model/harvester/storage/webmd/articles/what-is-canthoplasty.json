The most common cause of ectropion is muscle weakness due to aging, but it can also be caused by facial paralysis, eyelid growths, skin that has been scarred or damaged from surgery or trauma, and some genetic conditions such as Down syndrome.",

Entropion has many of the same causes as ectropion, such as muscle weakness and scarring or damage. Other causes include inflammation , a developmental condition, and an eye infection called trachoma. Trachoma is a bacterial infection of the eye common in many of the globe’s poorest areas and can lead to blindness.",

This facial paralysis is due to loss of function of the seventh cranial nerve. This loss of function can be due to many things, such as Bell’s Palsy, Moebius syndrome, tumors, trauma, and diseases including Lyme disease , leprosy, chicken pox , polio, Guillain-Barre syndrome , and more."
