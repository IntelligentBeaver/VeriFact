        "Systemic mastocytosis is a rare condition where too many mast cells build up in your body. Mast cells are a type of white blood cell that can release histamine, which can cause itching and inflammation. “Systemic” means the symptoms can affect your whole body. Systemic mastocytosis especially affects your skin, tissues, and organs. There are different types of systemic mastocytosis, ranging from slow-growing to advanced forms that are aggressive and cancerous.",

This medicine is also commonly used to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) , a rare type of cancer that affects the esophagus, stomach, and intestines. Ayvakit may also be used for other conditions as determined by your health care provider. This article focuses on the use of Ayvakit for systemic mastocytosis."
