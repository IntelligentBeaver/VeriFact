        "Nov. 27, 2000 -- When he first presented research on procrastination, Joseph Ferrari was often put off. \"I'd be given the last day at a conference,\" recalls Ferrari, PhD, an associate professor of psychology at DePaul University in Chicago, \"the last hour when people were packing up to go home. 'Oh, it's procrastination , you can talk then!' \"",

But today, their focus couldn't be more timely. In our computer-driven society, people can opt for hyperefficiency, but they can also mindlessly procrastinate with endless electronic distractions. The resulting damage -- while often trivialized -- can be severe, stunting careers and leaving lives mired in shame and self-doubt. Like many self-defeating behaviors, procrastination turns out to be deeply rooted in psyche and personality.",
