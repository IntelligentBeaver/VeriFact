        "Cucumbers are refreshing, juicy members of the gourd family that are popular in summer dishes and salads around the world. Cucumbers thrive in warm temperatures, making them a common addition to summertime gardens. Their mild flavor makes them easy to add to many dishes without affecting the flavor of the food, which makes cucumbers an easy way to add bulk to smaller meals. Cucumbers can also be pickled, and they pick up the flavor of the brine better than almost any other green thing. Cucumbers are technically considered berries, not vegetables. However, their green skin still offers some significant health benefits, as does the rest of the cucumber."

Cucumbers are 96% water, so they’re filling and nutritious but not calorie-dense. This high-water, low-calorie combination is great for weight management. Studies have shown that eating foods with low energy density, or few calories per gram, is connected with weight loss in people who are obese. Cucumbers are the very definition of a food with a low energy density, so adding them to your diet may help you maintain or reduce your weight.",

One such study tested the power of cucumber powder and found that adding cucumber to the diet significantly increases the amount of antioxidant activity in the body. While more studies should be done, cucumber root is a safe way to get more dietary antioxidants easily."
