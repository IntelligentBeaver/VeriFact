        "1. What appealed to you about playing the character Katie in your new movie, Midnight Sun ?",
        "I have quite a bit in common with the character, considering that her parent is a widow. So is mine. [Bella’s dad died in a motorcycle accident.] I definitely feel the pain that Katie goes through with wanting her dad to get out there and make more out of his life when she’s gone. I’ve felt that feeling many times with my mom. ... I love that Katie has it very rough in this movie and she still keeps a smile on her face. I think that’s the strongest way to go through pain.",
        "2. How did losing your father affect you?",
        "Sometimes I’m OK and other times I’m a mess. I’m pretty much ready to burst into tears a good amount of the day -- happy tears, sad tears, angry tears. Tears come for me often."
