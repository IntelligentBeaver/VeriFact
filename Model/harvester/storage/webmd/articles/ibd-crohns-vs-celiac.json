        "Celiac disease means your body can’t digest gluten, a protein in many grains like wheat, rye, and barley. If you do eat it, it makes your immune system attack your small intestine. Conditions that cause your immune cells to fight against your body are called autoimmune disorders.",
        "Crohn’s disease, on the other hand, is an inflammatory bowel disease. It’s also an autoimmune condition, but doctors don’t know what causes it. It leads to inflammation -- swelling, redness, or tenderness -- in the lining of your digestive tract. It can also trigger inflammation in other areas of your body, like your eyes and joints.",
