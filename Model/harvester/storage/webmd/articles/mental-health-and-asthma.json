        "I think most physical symptoms can mess with your mind, particularly asthma. Going through life questioning if today will be a day that I can’t breathe is plenty enough to kick off any amount of anxiety.",
        "I’ve been at events (dancing) without my inhaler (not smart) and had to retreat to the bathroom to focus on breathing, too embarrassed to ask for help (not smart).",
        "There are two emotions that are associated with my years of asthma: anxiety and depression . I know in the mental health world they are related.",
        "Anxiety can pop up anytime, like when I’m dancing or if I happen to go somewhere without my inhaler.",
        "Depression is more deeply set. It shows up when a friend mentions they’re doing a really cool hike with “amazing views” or when I wonder if natural childbirth might be absolutely impossible for me – or carrying at all.",
        "I think society discounts that for every physical condition there’s likely a mental health impact – ranging from anger or anxiety to depression. I’ve read too many stories of people who wanted to end their lives because of unbearable health issues.",
        "Let’s face it: Asthma is a life-threatening disease. While my asthma is well-controlled now, the memories of when it wasn’t and the knowledge that it still can be a dangerous disease are not lost on me. Talk about PTSD . If you’ve had even one asthma attack, I think it can get in your head. Not being able to breathe is an indescribable experience. I’ve written about how it feels like being underwater too long, to the point where you think you might drown. There’s a panic that sets in, and depending on where you are when you have an asthma attack, it can even for a moment make you wonder if this is it. This may be how you go. Ughhh ... it is awful, and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. I wouldn’t wish it on my best enemy."
