        "Canker sores , also known as aphthous ulcers, are annoying irritations inside the mouth that afflict as many as 20% of Americans. They are different from cold sores , which usually appear on the outside of the mouth on the lips. They are also different from traumatic ulcers, which look like canker sores but are caused by rough dentures, a slip of the toothbrush, or hot food.",
        "Canker sores appear most commonly in adolescents and young adults, often occurring during times of stress. They are also more likely to appear around a women’s menstrual period, and there is a greater likelihood of having canker sores if a parent also has them."
