        "Hives are swollen, pale red bumps, patches, or welts on the skin that appear suddenly. On darker skin tones, they can appear skin-colored and can be more difficult to see. They can happen because of allergies or other reasons. Your doctor may call them urticaria.",
        "Hives usually itch, but they may also burn or sting. They can show up anywhere on your body, including the face, lips, tongue, throat, and ears. Hives can change size rapidly and move around, disappearing in one place and reappearing in other places, often in a matter of hours. Hives can often appear and then clear up within a few hours. Some people have one flare-up and never get hives again. It’s also possible to have many flare-ups.",

        "Angioedema is different. The swelling happens under the skin, not on the surface. It’s marked by deep swelling around the eyes and lips and sometimes of the genitals, hands, and feet. It generally lasts longer than hives, but the swelling usually goes away in less than 24 hours. It’s rare, but angioedema of the throat, tongue, or lungs can block your airways, making it hard to breathe."
