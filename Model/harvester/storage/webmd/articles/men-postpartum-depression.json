        "Mothers are not the only ones at risk of depression when the baby arrives. Postpartum depression strikes a lot of dads as well. A 2010 study found that 1 in 10 men gets depression either shortly before or after the arrival of a newborn. That's only slightly lower than the rate among women. And researchers reported in April that young dads remain at higher risk of depression during the first few years of fatherhood.",

He's a professor of psychology at the University of Iowa. \"People have begun to look at postpartum depression in men over the past several years, but it's still flying under the radar.\"",
        "O'Hara says it's not clear yet whether there's a link between childbirth and a dad's depression, but changes such as lost sleep, changing family dynamics, and big responsibilities can raise the risk."
