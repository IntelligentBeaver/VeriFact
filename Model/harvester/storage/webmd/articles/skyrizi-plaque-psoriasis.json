        "Plaque psoriasis , the most common form of psoriasis, is a type of autoimmune condition where the body’s immune cells attack its own healthy cells. In people with plaque psoriasis, the immune system attacks healthy skin cells, which causes swelling (inflammation) . This can lead to the formation of too many skin cells, causing discolored patches on the skin. These patches, which are known as “plaques,” are sections of thick, raised skin that may be covered with a thin, silvery-white scale."

        "For most people, the key to treating plaque psoriasis is to avoid triggers, moisturize the skin, and apply topical treatments as prescribed. But this is not always enough for people with very bad symptoms. People with more severe plaque psoriasis may need additional treatments that target the body’s overactive immune system .",
