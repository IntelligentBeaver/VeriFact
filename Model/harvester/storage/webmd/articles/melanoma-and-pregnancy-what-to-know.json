        "May 1, 2023 – Research shows that 1 in 1,000 women will be diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy, and melanoma is the most common cancer these patients will be diagnosed with. This form of skin cancer can be deadly if not caught early. Studies show that one-third of melanoma cases are diagnosed in women of childbearing age.",
        "Melanoma detection is especially important for expectant mothers. This is because hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy may affect skin cells, speeding up the growth of melanoma and potentially causing it to spread to other places in the body.",
        "“Pregnancy lowers a woman’s immunity, which may permit malignant cells to proliferate if present,” said Anna C. Pavlick, DO , founding director of the Cutaneous Oncology Program at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian and associate director for clinical research at Weill Cornell Medicine's Meyer Cancer Center in New York City. “Some melanomas also harbor estrogen receptors which can be stimulated with pregnancy.”",
        "The good news: Doctors can safely remove and treat melanoma during pregnancy, so a woman at risk should definitely be checked for the disease before and during her pregnancy."
