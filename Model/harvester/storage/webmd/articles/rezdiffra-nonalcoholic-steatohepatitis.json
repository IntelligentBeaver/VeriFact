They were told to take Rezdiffra or placebo pills (containing no medicine) once daily for a year. The dose used in the trial was either 80 milligrams or 100 milligrams. The average age of people in the trial was about 56, more than half were women (about 57%). Most of the people in the trial (about 90%) were White, about 2% of people in the study were Black, and 3% were Asian. Other races included in the study were not reported. Most people in the trial also had other diseases like high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol. The trial looked at two things to decide if Rezdiffra was helpful for improving MASH."
