        "How Long It Takes : Each electrolysis treatment is relatively short - from 10 to 20 minutes - but if you want a lot of hair removed, it could take up to a year of weekly treatments. Since each hair is treated one at a time, take a glance at the thickness of your \"fur\" and you'll have an idea of how long a commitment it will require.",

If used for genital hair removal, a local anesthetic can help, though many men find treatment in this area to be very painful."
