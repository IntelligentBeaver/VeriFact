There's no cure for IgA nephropathy, but treatments can manage your symptoms and slow kidney damage. Nephrologists are kidney specialists who treat IgA nephropathy. Your doctor will create a treatment plan to relieve your symptoms and slow kidney damage. Treatments for IgA nephropathy include medicine, diet changes, and sometimes a kidney transplant."

Corticosteroids calm your immune system so that it doesn't damage the filters in your kidneys. If IgA nephropathy gets worse, your doctor may prescribe these medicines to slow damage to your kidneys.
