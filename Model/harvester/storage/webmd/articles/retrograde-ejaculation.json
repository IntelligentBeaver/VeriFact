Premature ejaculation, the most common form of sexual dysfunction in men, often is due to nervousness over how well they will perform during sex . Certain drugs, including some antidepressants , may affect ejaculation. This generally does not require treatment unless it impairs fertility .",

This is due to problems with the nerves in the bladder and the bladder neck that allow the ejaculate to flow backward and into the bladder. In other men, retrograde ejaculation occurs after operations on the bladder neck or prostate , or after certain abdominal operations. Nerve damage to the spinal cord or back can also affect ejaculation, as can medications including alpha blockers (to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia - bph)."
