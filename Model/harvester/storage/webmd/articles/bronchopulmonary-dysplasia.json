        "When a baby is born prematurely, the lungs sometimes aren’t fully formed. They can’t take in and absorb enough oxygen to stay alive on their own. They also might not produce enough of a fluid called surfactant, which helps keep the lungs open. When this happens, doctors give the baby extra oxygen.",
        "But that treatment carries risks for the newborn. Using a machine like a ventilator to pump more oxygen into the baby’s lungs can irritate the airways and scar the still-fragile air sacs that line the lungs. High levels of oxygen can cause more damage as well.",
        "The irritation and scarring makes it harder for the premature infant to breathe on their own. That can mean the baby will have to stay on a ventilator longer to get oxygen. The damage also can spread to the blood vessels that pick up oxygen from the air sacs. That means the baby’s tiny heart has to pump harder. And because so much of the body’s effort is spent breathing, the baby might grow slowly. That can cause problems with other still-developing organs."
