        "Aug. 21, 2024 -- Eating a hamburger or a few pieces of bacon daily may increase the risk of developing diabetes by up to 15%. The type of meat consumed, and whether it is processed, can significantly impact the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes over about 10 years.",
        "That’s according to a new study led by researchers at the University of Cambridge in England that was also published Wednesday in the journal The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology . Nearly 4 in 10 U.S. adults already have prediabetes and are at high risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes, which is condition that affects how the body converts food into energy. Typically diagnosed around age 45 or later, type 2 diabetes can cause serious complications like kidney disease and in 2021 was the eighth leading cause of death in the U.S.",

They took into account known type 2 diabetes risk factors like physical activity level and body mass index, and used other statistical methods to attempt to isolate the relationship between meat consumption and type 2 diabetes risk."

People who regularly ate 50 grams of processed meat per day, such as two slices of ham, had a 15% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes over the course of 10 years. Eating 100 grams of unprocessed red meat, such as a small steak, was linked to a 10% increased risk. The researchers also reported that replacing processed meat with unprocessed red meat or poultry could lower a person’s type 2 diabetes risk. Another recent study from last year also found that substituting other foods like dairy, nuts, or legumes to reduce red meat intake was linked to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes."
