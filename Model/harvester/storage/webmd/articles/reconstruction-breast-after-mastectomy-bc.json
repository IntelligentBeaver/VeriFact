        "Implants can rupture, causing pain and infection. You may need surgery to remove or replace them. TRAM flap procedures use the tissue from your belly area to create a mound to reconstruct the breast. In general, this means cutting away at least some of your stomach muscles, fat, and blood supply to use for the reconstruction. Sometimes, the tissue that’s being moved is kept attached to its blood supply. This is called a pedicle or tunneling procedure. The flap has a better chance of surviving because the blood supply remains in place, but the breast may not look exactly the way you want. In a free-flap procedure, the tissue is disconnected and then attached to a blood supply near the new location. This is a more complicated procedure. The biggest risk is that the blood vessels may get clogged and the flap might die. The benefit is that the reconstruction looks more like a natural breast. A new version of the procedure, called the muscle-sparing free TRAM flap, cuts away far less muscle from the belly area. This often makes for a quicker recovery and less risk of losing core strength after surgery."
