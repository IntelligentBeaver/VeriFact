        "\"Chemopause\" is the term used for medically induced menopause while you’re receiving chemotherapy for cancer treatment. As a young adult, I didn’t envision being in my early 30s and having to think about what menopause may feel like for a long time or how to adapt to the symptoms. However, cancer treatment had another plan for me.",
        "I remember being told during one of my many visits before the beginning of active treatment that one of the side effects I would be experiencing based on the chemotherapy I was receiving was going to pause the function of my ovaries and may or may not be permanent. At the moment, that was the least of my worries. Honestly, I was more concerned about my hair loss because I didn’t quite understand all the side effects that came along with my ovaries not functioning.",
        "It started with a missed period, and then another, and so on. Eventually, I didn’t have a menstrual cycle for over a year and a half. The idea of not having a period while dealing with so many other side effects was quite lovely. However, I would soon find out it was very much the opposite of the word lovely."

If you could picture running water down your body from head to toe, that is what I felt was happening. I wanted to run into a walk-in freezer! I soon learned that a handheld fan and those small battery-operated fans were going to be my best friends.",

I would wrap the ice packs with a light cloth and put them on my feet and my neck while I slept underneath the ceiling fan. If you cannot install a ceiling fan, a portable fan should work just fine, too."

        "I also experienced a lot of insomnia. In my opinion, this might have been a combination of the heavy steroids as well as a side effect of the chemopause. There were many times I would not sleep for 2 or more days. I would fall asleep here and there, but I couldn’t sleep through the night. I’m sure the night sweats did not help at all either.",
        "Since I was hot and I loved tea, I would make batches of mint and chamomile tea and place them in the refrigerator. I would then drink the iced tea at night before preparing to go to bed to relax. I also enjoy the smell of lavender and have found that it also relaxes me. So I would also rub a little lavender oil on my hands, place them in front of me, and do some breathing exercises and this would relax me.",
        "Chemopause side effects can come in many forms and vary. It’s important to continue to communicate all your side effects with your oncologist so that they can continue to monitor your health. In some cases, they may be able to prescribe medication to help alleviate some of those side effects."
