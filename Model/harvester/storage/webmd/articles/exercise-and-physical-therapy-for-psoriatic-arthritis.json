        "Once you develop psoriatic arthritis, the tendency is to avoid pain by not exercising at all. This is a serious mistake. It is critically important to maintain the best range of motion possible for each of your joints and to focus on strengthening and conditioning the weight-bearing joints (knees and hips) in particular. Bear in mind that the physical therapist will push you to just beyond your limit to ensure that you are making progress. I find that grimacing at the therapist is a pretty good indicator as to when I have reached my limit.",

        "Knees. In 1999, I started having significant pain in my knees. Eventually, it got to a point that I could not go from sitting to standing without simultaneously pushing up with my arms and crossing my legs at my ankles. My rheumatologist referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, who recommended that I have total joint replacement of both knees.",
        "Many of my lessons learned about exercise came from my hospital physical therapists. These therapists made me realize that unless you maintain strength in the muscles surrounding a joint (in this case, my quadriceps), the body comes to rely on the joints themselves rather than the muscles. For me, the result was damage and destruction of the joints, tendons, and surrounding bones. Not surprisingly, the principal solution was a simple sit-to-stand exercise, repeated throughout the day."

I was especially anxious about this activity since I had already had both knees replaced, so I asked for both therapists to help me up from the bed. Surprisingly, I felt no pain at the left hip when standing, so they asked me if I wanted to walk to the door. When I arrived there, they asked if I wanted to walk down a hallway. Once I walked the entire hall, they reminded me that I would have to walk as far back as I had walked, so we returned to my room."

        "In 2014, after many years of issues with my right (dominant) rotator cuff and shoulder, an orthopedic surgeon recommended total reverse shoulder replacement (where the position of the ball and socket are switched, and the rotator cuff is bypassed using the deltoid muscle). Following the surgery, I was warned that I would be unable to put my hand behind my back and my lifetime weight limit for lifting would be 5 pounds. The exercises included raising the arm to the ceiling by inching up a wall (fortunately, I had full extension), simple lightweight lifting using exercise bands (either pulling to my chest or to my side). Swimming using the breaststroke is a good exercise, the overhand crawl is difficult due to the restrictions arising from the reverse shoulder replacement.",
        "If I feel excessive pain after exercising, I put an ice pack on the affected area. If the pain lasts more than a half hour, I cut back on the repetitions when I next do the same pattern of exercises. I had all my surgeries while I was working, and thinking back, I realize that I was highly motivated to recover from each surgery in order to return to work and restore my daily activities, even if somewhat restricted in the “new normal.”"
