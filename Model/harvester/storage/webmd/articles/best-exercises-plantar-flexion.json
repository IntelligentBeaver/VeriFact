        "Plantar flexion is the movement that allows you to press the gas pedal of your car. It also allows ballet dancers to stand on their toes . The term plantar flexion refers to the movement of the foot in a downward motion away from the body. This movement is crucial in many actions including the everyday action of walking. Conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis can reduce plantar flexion and make walking more difficult.",
        "The ankle joint , which is actually two joints, makes plantar flexion possible. It also enables the opposite movement, dorsiflexion, which is the movement of the foot toward the leg. Your ankle joint supplies the power for 40% to 70% of your forward movement during walking.",
        "Ankle weakness and ankle injuries can limit your ability to hold down a job and to live independently. They also negatively impact your quality of life. Exercise is important in keeping ankles strong and flexible and in recovering from injury. For older adults, \"foot gymnastics\" can increase muscle strength, improve gait speed, and reduce the likelihood of falling."
