More than 90% of moms-to-be say they intend to breast feed, yet less than 60% are doing so when their babies reach 6 months old. Even fewer – just 27% – exclusively breastfeed at that point.",

Breastfed babies are less likely to have respiratory illnesses, skin conditions, and stomach and intestinal problems like diarrhea . They have a lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome, and a long-term reduced risk of obesity, diabetes, and childhood leukemia . Breast milk contains antibodies that can help boost babies' immunity against a range of infections, including measles .

            "Sleep on it. \"Sleep helps tremendously in mood and executive functioning like decision-making,\" Demirci said. \"Unfortunately, sleep is also hard to come by postpartum.\" Aim to get at least two uninterrupted four-hour stretches of sleep per 24 hours. Have your support people do feedings and diaper changes during those times. \"Some moms will pump right before they go to bed for the first stretch so that a bottle of expressed milk is ready to go for the first wakening of the night,\" Demirci said.",
