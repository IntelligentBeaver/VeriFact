      "content": [
        "The FDA has approved a new combination therapy that uses two different types of anticancer medicines for treating adults with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who can't receive cisplatin, a common chemotherapy drug. The approved combination includes the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocker Keytruda (pembrolizumab) or its under-the-skin injectable version Keytruda Qlex (pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph) along with an antibody-drug conjugate, Padcev (enfortumab vedotin).",
        "This is the first time an immunotherapy medicine (Keytruda) and an antibody-drug conjugate (Padcev) have been approved together for use before and after bladder removal surgery. Keytruda helps your immune system find and attack cancer cells, whereas Padcev is a targeted therapy that attaches to specific proteins on the cancer cells and delivers cancer-fighting medicine directly inside them.",
        "MIBC is a serious type of bladder cancer that grows into the muscle wall and can spread quickly. Even after surgery, about half of the people with MIBC see their cancer come back. Until now, there were few treatment options for people who couldn't take or didn't want cisplatin chemotherapy. This approval matters as this new combination may help improve outcomes for people who haven't had new options in many years."

        "The FDA approved this treatment based on a clinical study that showed that the combination of Keytruda and Padcev given before and after surgery, versus surgery alone, helped people live longer and stay cancer-free for a longer period.",
        "In a large phase III study involving 344 patients with MIBC who were unable to receive cisplatin, treatment with the Keytruda plus Padcev combination before and after surgery, versus surgery alone, reduced the risk of cancer recurrence or worsening by 60% and lowered the risk of death by 50%. At the time of the analysis, for people on the combination treatment, median survival times had not yet been reached, while the surgery-only group had a median event-free survival of 15.7 months and a median overall survival of 41.7 months. The study also showed that more patients had no cancer left after treatment with this combination therapy than after surgery alone (57% vs. 9%). Side effects were similar to those seen in earlier studies."
