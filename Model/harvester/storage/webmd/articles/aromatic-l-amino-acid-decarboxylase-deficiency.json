        "AADC deficiency is an ultra-rare genetic disorder. It affects how your cells send signals to each other.",
        "People born with this condition don’t make enough aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). That’s an enzyme that helps your brain and nervous system work. Babies and kids with AADC deficiency have developmental delays, weak muscle tone, and movement disorders. They can get other symptoms, too, like droopy eyelids, stiff muscles, and stomach problems.",
        "AADC helps your body make serotonin and dopamine . These are \"chemical messengers\" called neurotransmitters. Without enough AADC, you don't have enough neurotransmitters to send signals through your nervous system. That makes it hard to control your body, especially your head, face, and neck. It can also affect things like your blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature.",
        "Signs of AADC deficiency occur early in your baby’s life. There isn’t a cure, but treatment might help manage their symptoms.",
        "It’s OK to ask for help as you or your child deals with this lifelong condition. Tap into your health care team, friends, and family, or find others going through the same thing. A support network can be a big help."

We were not even home for more than a day when I developed symptoms of an infection, so we headed right back to the hospital. That ended up saving Jillian’s life; my husband took her to show her off to the maternity ward nurses and mentioned offhandedly that she felt cold every time he kissed her, which led to a temperature check. Her temperature was so low they thought the thermometer was broken. It wasn’t; they called a code on her. Later they told us she was only about 3 hours from dying.",

Back home, she was sleeping 23 hours a day and was floppy like a rag doll when awake. Around 3 months old, she started having frightening spells where her eyes would roll up into her head, her body would get stiff, her breathing would become rattly, and she would gag on her tongue and turn gray and purple.
