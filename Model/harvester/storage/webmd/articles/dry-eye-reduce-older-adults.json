        "Do you ever get a scratchy, burning, or stinging feeling in your eyes? What you feel could be dry eye. It's a condition where you don't make enough tears or your tears evaporate too quickly and don't lubricate your eyes enough. The cause could be anything from dry air to a medication you take. Dry eye is so common that millions of Americans deal with it each year. Once you reach age 50 and beyond, you're more likely to have this problem. Other dry eye disease symptoms include: Eye redness Sensitivity to light A feeling like a foreign object is in your eye Watery eyes Blurred vision Trouble driving at night Dry eye can be annoying, or worse. If it's severe and you don't treat it, you could develop eye inflammation and damage to tissue on the eyes surface with possibly vision loss. Dry eye treatments like medicated eye drops and eye inserts can boost your tear production, reduce evaporation, and relieve dryness. While you work with your eye doctor to get the dryness under control, a few tips can relieve dry eye symptoms and make you feel more comfortable."

Keep your eyelids clean by washing them with mild soap and water and then rinsing. You can also buy a lid scrub at the drugstore to remove debris and clean your eyelids. Hold a warm wet washcloth to your eyelids for five to 10 minutes when your eyes feel dry. This will help release more oil from the glands."

Some research has suggested that taking a fish oil supplement might reduce dry eye symptoms. But other research didn't find omega-3s any better than placebo (inactive drops) for dry eye. Despite the mixed study results, omega-3 fatty acids still may be worth trying because they're good for your health in general. The recommended dose for dry eye is 2 to 3 grams of fish oil per day. While fish oil supplements are generally safe, ask your doctor before you take them. They can cause side effects in some people. For example, fish oil can increase bleeding in people who take blood thinners ."
