        "Dec. 18, 2023 – Severe obesity among preschool-age children from low-income families is on the rise in the U.S., according to a new analysis of federal data.",
        "An estimated 2% of children ages 2 to 4 years old had severe obesity in 2020, up from 1.8% in 2016, according to the report that appeared Monday in Pediatrics , a journal published by the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
        "The increase is “small but significant,” a group of experts not involved in the research wrote in a companion commentary published alongside the research.",
        "The new data puts an end to hopes that childhood obesity was on the retreat, since a small decrease had been observed from 2010 to 2016. Instead, the researchers noted that the new childhood obesity figures reflect those of the general population. About 20% of children and teens in the U.S. are obese, and about 42% of adults in the U.S. are obese, according to the CDC.",
        "This latest study looked for severe obesity, which was defined as being well above the 95 th percentile for the combined height-weight measure known as body mass index . The figures are important because rates of severe obesity among young children can foreshadow health problems that may occur on a scale to warrant concerns among public health officials, policymakers, and health care professionals."
