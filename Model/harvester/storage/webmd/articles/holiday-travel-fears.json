        "I want to accept an invitation, but I’m scared. Our family is having a reunion at the end of December. We haven’t gotten together in 7 years, and I’d like to go, but we’re meeting at my late brother’s farm in rural Oregon. This trip brings up a lot of issues for me, and I wonder if I should go or stay home and join with WhatsApp. Some of my concerns relate to my mobility scooter , but others might resonate for most people with multiple sclerosis (MS).",
        "Travel. I will have to fly and bus to get to Oregon, and then ride in different people’s cars to get to the farm and get around to events. The planes will be small, and I won’t be able to ride my scooter on them. (it will ride in cargo. Will it be OK?)",
        "I see on the airline website that we are supposed to tell the airline about wheelchairs when booking a flight, but I cannot see how to do it on the online booking site I’m using. The phone numbers the airlines give for customer service just take me to government disability hotlines, which tell me to ‘hang up and call the airline.’ Should I just come to the airport early and hope it all works out?"
