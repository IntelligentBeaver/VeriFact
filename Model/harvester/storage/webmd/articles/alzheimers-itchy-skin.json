        "People with Alzheimer’s disease might itch and scratch or pick at their skin for many reasons. It may be hard for your loved one to let you know what the problem is, so you’ll need to pay close attention and see if you can figure it out.",
        "Dry skin is one of the most common causes of scratching and picking. It’s common in older adults because as we age our skin gets thinner and doesn’t hold as much moisture. This often makes the skin irritated and itchy. It can also result from using harsh cleansers or soaps, bathing too often, or bathing in hard water or well water. And it’s common in areas where the climate is hot or cold and the air is dry.",
        "Itchy skin with red bumps may result from bug bites:",
        "Bed bugs. These small oval insects feed on blood. They live on furniture, on beds, and in carpets. They’re mostly active at night. Their bites don’t hurt, but they leave small, flat or raised bumps often in a row on the skin. The bites are commonly found on the face, neck, hands, and arms. They cause redness, swelling, and intense itching. Steroid creams or oral antihistamines , like Benadryl, can help relieve the itch. Pest-control experts can get rid of bed bugs in the home.",
        "Fleas . They commonly infest pets and areas such as pet bedding and carpet. Their bites cause itchy red bumps that may swell. The inflamed area often turns white when pressed. Fleas usually bite the ankles, waist, armpits, and in the bends of knees and elbows. Clean any bites with soap and water, then pat dry. To relieve the itch, use hydrocortisone cream or calamine lotion. Cold compresses may also help if the bites are swollen or inflamed. To get rid of fleas, bathe pets with flea shampoos or use flea treatments . Clean all carpeting and pet bedding with insecticide powders, foggers, or sprays. Follow the directions. Some products have toxic fumes and you can’t go back into the house for a couple of hours after you use them."

You need a prescription for treatment, so call your doctor if you think scabies are why your loved one is scratching and picking. To ease the itch, put cool, wet washcloths on the area.

To get rid of head and pubic lice, you can shave the affected area or use over-the-counter shampoos or lotions for lice. To help get rid of body lice, use good hygiene habits and change clothes regularly. Lice can also live on clothes, towels, and bedding, so wash these in hot water and machine dry on the hot cycle.

        "This itchy, bright red rash is often especially red on the edges. It's typically found in moist areas, such as the armpits, under the breasts, abdominal folds, inner thighs, buttocks, and groin. It’s caused by a yeast-like fungus. It can get worse if your loved one sweats a lot or doesn’t bathe or change clothes often. Antibiotics or steroids like prednisone can also cause the fungus to grow. To ease the rash, keep the skin clean and dry, let the area have contact with the air, and use an anti-yeast cream.",
        "​Allergies are another common cause of itching and scratching. Allergies to medicines or foods can make someone itch and scratch all over. Allergies that result from contact with an irritant will result in a rash at the point of contact.",
        "If you can’t figure out why your loved one scratches or picks at their skin all the time, it could be a behavior linked to the condition. It may be a way for them to comfort or distract themselves. People who do this aren’t usually upset, but they can hurt themselves. Also, because of changes in their thought process as part of Alzheimer’s disease, your loved one may not have good personal hygiene. That may lead to itchy skin and scratching."
