Endocrine therapy, also called hormone therapy, can either lower the amount of hormones your body makes or keep the cancer cells from using those hormones. It’s most often prescribed for at least 5 years to help keep cancer from coming back after surgery. Most everyone whose cancer is HR+ is offered endocrine therapy. It may be combined with other types of treatment, like chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Which specific drug you’ll get  depends on things like the stage of the cancer and whether you’ve been through menopause."

        "There are many treatment plans involving endocrine therapy. Your doctor will recommend a treatment plan that’s tailored to your individual situation. But cancer experts have general guidelines for when to use specific drugs. For early-stage HR+ breast cancer, doctors typically prescribe endocrine therapy for 5-10 years. Before menopause, tamoxifen is usually recommended. If you can’t take it for some reason, an aromatase inhibitor plus an LHRH may be best. Women who go through menopause during treatment may switch from tamoxifen to an aromatase inhibitor. After menopause, you may be given either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. Another option is to take one of these drugs for several years, and the other for several more. For stage IV (metastatic) HR+ breast cancer, endocrine therapy is used for as long as it’s helpful. The first-line recommended treatment is either an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant , plus a targeted therapy drug called a CDK4/6 inhibitor. If you haven’t been through menopause, you’ll also need some form of ovarian suppression with these drugs. People past menopause could get toremifene. Tamoxifen is another option for anyone. If you have advanced cancer and the tumor cells have a mutation in the ESR1 gene, you might try elacestrant if another endocrine therapy drug hasn’t worked."
