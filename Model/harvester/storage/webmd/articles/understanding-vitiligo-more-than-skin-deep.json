        "Have you ever noticed someone with light or white patches on their skin and wondered what it might be? That’s vitiligo, a chronic autoimmune condition that causes a loss of skin pigmentation. Affecting about 1% of the global population, vitiligo impacts people of all races, ages, and genders. While it directly affects the skin, its ripple effects go far deeper, influencing your identity, confidence, and connections with others.",
        "Let’s explore what vitiligo is, the physical and emotional challenges it brings, and how advocacy and representation can foster greater understanding and empowerment.",
        "What Is Vitiligo?",
        "Vitiligo is caused by an autoimmune response where the body mistakenly attacks melanocytes -- the cells responsible for skin pigment. This results in white patches of varying sizes on the skin. It can appear anywhere, including the face, hands, and even hair, which may turn white where pigmentation is lost.",
        "Contrary to some misconceptions, vitiligo doesn’t discriminate by skin tone. However, the contrast between affected and unaffected skin can be more visible on darker skin. The condition isn’t harmful physically, but it can profoundly influence emotional well-being."

The curious stares, comments, or questions can be challenging but also serve as opportunities to educate and advocate for greater understanding.",

        "3. Oral medications . These may complement other treatments.",
