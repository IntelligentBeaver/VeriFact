        "Imfinzi (durvalumab) is an immunotherapy medicine that helps the immune system detect and attack cancer cells. The FDA has approved a combination of Imfinzi and standard chemotherapy medicines – fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel (FLOT) – for treating adults with early-stage or locally advanced stomach (gastric) or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer that can be removed via surgery (resectable cancer). Patients receive Imfinzi together with FLOT before and after surgery and then continue with Imfinzi alone (monotherapy) to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back.",
        "Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, with nearly 1 million new cases and over 650,000 deaths reported in 2022. GEJ cancer is a type of gastric cancer that develops in the area where the food pipe (esophagus) joins the stomach. The number of new cases of gastric cancer is increasing in people younger than 50, with thousands of patients receiving treatment for early-stage or locally advanced stomach or GEJ cancer around the world. These cancers often come back, even after surgery and chemotherapy, with about 1 in 4 patients relapsing within a year. Long-term survival is poor, with less than half of the patients surviving beyond five years."

        "Imfinzi is a lab-made antibody that works by blocking a protein called PD-L1 (programmed death‑ligand 1), which is used by some cancer cells to evade your immune system. By stopping PD-L1 from binding with PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) and CD80 proteins on immune cells, Imfinzi helps your immune system recognize and fight tumor cells.

Imfinzi can sometimes cause your immune system to attack healthy parts of your body, such as your lungs, liver, intestines, skin, pancreas, or hormone glands, resulting in serious problems that may happen during or after treatment. Imfinzi may also cause reactions during the IV, such as chills or shaking, itching or rashes, dizziness, or a hard time breathing.",
