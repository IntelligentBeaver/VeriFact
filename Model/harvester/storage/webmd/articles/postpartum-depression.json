        "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a complex mix of physical, emotional, and behavioral changes that happen after you give birth. It's a form of major depression that begins within a year after childbirth – most often within the first three months. The diagnosis is based not only on when it happens but how serious your depression is.",
        "Postpartum depression is linked to hormonal, social, and psychological changes that happen when you have a baby and care for a newborn. PPD can be treated with medication and counseling.",
        "It's common to have a mild case of the \"baby blues\" after giving birth, but this usually goes away within a few weeks. About 1 out of every 10 people will develop a more serious and longer-lasting depression after delivering a baby.",
        "Your doctor may refer to postpartum depression by the umbrella term \"perinatal depression.\" This includes depression that happens during pregnancy or after childbirth.",
        "No parent is immune, whatever their gender. Research has shown that about 1 in 10 new fathers get depression during the year their child is born. Their symptoms may include sadness, anxiety, or tiredness. They may feel overwhelmed or notice changes in sleep and eating habits.",
        "Adoptive parents, surrogates, and parents of surrogate-born babies can all develop PPD. In the case of adoptive parents and parents of children born via surrogacy, emotional and mental stresses are the likely causes. Both hormonal and emotional factors may be in play for surrogates.",
