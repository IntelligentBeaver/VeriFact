The average adult 's skin weighs about 6 pounds. Its job is crucial — to protect you from infections and germs. Throughout your life, your skin changes constantly, for better or worse. In fact, your skin regenerates itself approximately every 27 days. Proper skin care is key to maintaining the health and vitality of this crucial organ."
