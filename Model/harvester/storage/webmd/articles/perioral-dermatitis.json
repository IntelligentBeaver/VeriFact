        "Dermatitis tends to be worse at night for a couple of reasons. We all wake up briefly multiple times a night, and during these periods, itchiness may feel more intense, leading you to scratch and even bleed if you do it too much. Also, your internal clock, or circadian rhythm, plays a role. The hour or two before bedtime is when heat escapes from your hands, feet, and skin, making you feel itchier than usual. Studies suggest that children with dermatitis sleep the soundest between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., which lines up with their coolest body temperatures."
