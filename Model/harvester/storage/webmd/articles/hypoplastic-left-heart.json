        "Sometimes during pregnancy , the left side of a baby's heart doesn't grow the way it should. This causes a rare defect called hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). About 1,000 babies are born with it in the U.S. each year.",
        "Normally, the right side of your heart pumps blood from your heart to your lungs where it gets oxygen. After it goes back to your heart, the left side then pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body.",
        "The heart of a baby with HLHS can't do this. The lower left chamber may be smaller than normal or not there at all. The valves on the left side may not work right or the main artery leaving the heart may not be as big as it should be.",
        "A baby with HLHS also may have a hole between the left and right upper chamber of their heart. This is called an atrial septal defect, and it can cause too much blood to flow to the lungs."
