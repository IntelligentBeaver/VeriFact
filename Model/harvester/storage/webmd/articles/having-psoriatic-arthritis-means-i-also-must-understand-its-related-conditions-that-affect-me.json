        "Because I have psoriatic arthritis (PsA), I am at risk of developing related health conditions. Some of these related conditions have a lowered risk because I am effectively treating my PsA. I am regularly screened for the related conditions by my primary care physician and my rheumatologist. It is possible that I may not feel or notice any symptoms for these conditions. By screening, if some of these conditions are caught early, they can be more easily treated with medications or lifestyle changes. I have been treating my PsA for over 20 years now, so hopefully, I have lowered most of the risks of related conditions.",
        "Not everyone with PsA has psoriasis. I had psoriasis before the arthritis symptoms. When I began treatment for PsA, my psoriasis only showed up on rare occasions of stress. If I am in severe PsA flares, I will also have psoriasis flares. It isn’t often because my PsA is well-controlled with medication and diet. At the beginning of the pandemic, my PsA and psoriasis flared the worst that I had ever experienced a flare. I even switched to a new biologic to see if that had a better effect on the treatment of both the PsA and the psoriasis. That worked well. My psoriasis cleared up almost completely with just that one change. I also have added a dermatologist as another health care professional on my team to follow my care.",
        "Heart disease can also affect people with PsA. There are several conditions referred to as heart disease. These include arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and heart valve dysfunction. I am on medication for an irregular heartbeat, for increased risk of a stroke, and for a heart attack in the past at some point. Because I started seeing a cardiologist after some of my regular screening tests came back abnormal, I was able to begin the correct care and treatment to prevent further damage to my heart walls and to keep my heart rhythm stable. Also, my valves look good and are not functioning abnormally. I continue to get screened for strokes as well. I feel like what has happened to me related to my heart and cardiovascular system was caught early and has been treated and continues to be screened."

        "I was diagnosed with hypertension – high blood pressure – before I was diagnosed with any other health condition. My primary care physician had no idea why I had hypertension at such an early age. I was still in nursing school, and I had what they referred to as a hypertensive storm. I was also diagnosed with high cholesterol and elevated levels of fats in the blood, or lipids. Both hypertension and elevated lipids and cholesterol can lead to heart disease if left untreated or if not caught early enough. Although I am not considered obese, my BMI has increased as I inch closer and closer to 50 years of age. Obesity and increased BMI can lead to an increased risk of heart disease or worsen the PsA. I was told by my doctors that medications, especially injectables and infusions, are based on the patient’s weight. If you put on weight, it can affect the dose that you're taking. Excess weight can interfere with the effectiveness of drugs that treat PsA. Also, extra weight puts more pressure on your joints. Maintaining a healthy weight and lowering your BMI take the pressure off the knees, hips, and back.",
        "It is common for people with PsA to have mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety. As someone with PsA, I am at considerable risk. I have talked about this with my doctors, and I see a counselor to talk about my anxiety and depression on a weekly basis. Psoriasis affects the skin and my appearance and self-esteem. Chronic pain, fatigue, and decreased mobility make socializing difficult for me and increases my loneliness and isolation. This can lead to more emotional distress and cause more depression. Having an anxiety disorder causes you to struggle with feelings of anxiety, worry, fear, and panic. It can interfere with daily activities and can last a long time. Having depression causes you to experience a persistent sad mood that lasts a long time and interferes with daily activities. Sometimes I may lose interest in activities that I once enjoyed, have persistent helplessness, have hopelessness, have sadness, develop sleep pattern changes, have difficulty concentrating, and withdraw from my circle of friends."

        "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can occur with PsA. The body mistakes healthy tissue for a foreign invader and attacks it. There is a genetic link between IBD and PsA too. Doctors have told me that there is a change in my gut bacteria that leads to inflammation affecting my GI tract and my joints and spine. Symptoms can be mild to severe and come and go with periods of flares. The common inflammatory bowel diseases are ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.",

With uveitis, I have eye redness, pain, sensitivity to light, watery eyes, eye swelling, and blurred vision. My symptoms come on suddenly and progress quickly. I must notify my eye specialist at once with a uveitis flare to prevent any further damage to the eyes. It can lead to cataracts, glaucoma, or even vision loss if left untreated. The systemic inflammation from PsA leads to inflammation in the eye. I have an eye specialist for uveitis because I have had this condition many times before. I can catch it early, so I have no further damage."
