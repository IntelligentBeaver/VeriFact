Ejection fraction (EF) is the percentage of blood that leaves your heart when the lower chambers of your heart contract.",

People with heart failure often do not make enough NO, which means they do not fully activate sGC, which can lead to tightened blood vessels. Verquvo activates sGC (like NO does) and causes your blood vessels to relax. When your blood vessels are relaxed, your heart is able to pump blood and oxygen to the rest of your body easier."
