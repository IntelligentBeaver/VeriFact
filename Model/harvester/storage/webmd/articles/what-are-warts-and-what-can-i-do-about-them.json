        "What Are Warts?",
        "Warts are benign skin growths that result from infection of the upper layers of skin with human papillomavirus (HPV). They often appear as rough, skin-colored bumps with black dots and can be solitary or numerous. While benign, warts are contagious and can be passed directly from person to person or via transfer from contaminated surfaces. You can even spread them to yourself, from one part of the body to another, in a process called autoinoculation.",

        "Genital warts (also known as condyloma acuminata) are often found in your groin folds, pubic area, around the anus, as well as external and internal genitals. Two groups of HPV strains are responsible for genital warts and are distinguished by their association with HPV-related cancers, such as cervical cancer. HPV types 6 and 11 are considered low-risk subtypes; types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35 are considered high-risk."
