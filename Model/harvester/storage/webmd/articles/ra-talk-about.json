        "By Kelly Mack, as told to Hope Cristol There aren’t a lot of people these days who end up in wheelchairs because of rheumatoid arthritis (RA ). At age 45, I’m one of them -- but I’ve been in a wheelchair, except during physical therapy , for most of my life. I was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis when I was 2 years old. That was in 1979, and there weren’t very good treatments for RA, not even methotrexate . (Editor’s note: The FDA approved methotrexate for RA in 1988, and the first biologic for RA a decade later.) The disease did a lot of damage to my joints early on. By around age 10, I used a wheelchair whenever I had bad days or had to walk certain distances. As a teenager, I had my hips and knees replaced. So I’ve had a lot of experience with people asking what’s wrong with me or why I’m in a wheelchair."

If they ask me questions, even if it comes out in the “wrong” way, I’ll usually talk about my health history to whatever extent they’re interested. I also want to make space for people who are uncomfortable around disability. It’s hard to get over the stigma. Sometimes I explain that my wheelchair doesn’t keep me from regular life; it’s what lets me have one. With my wheelchair, I can go out to dinner with friends. I can roll along to places I need or want to be. Without a wheelchair, I pretty much can’t. And after people hear that, a lot of times they’ll nod and say, “Yeah, that makes sense.”"
