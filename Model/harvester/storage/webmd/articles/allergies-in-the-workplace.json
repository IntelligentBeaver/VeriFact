This can be daunting at first, especially in a high-pressure situation like an interview; however, it’s important that your employers understand the seriousness of your condition. This will also give you a good indication of their existing policies, if any, and how they are willing to adapt to your needs.",

In my own  experiences, people have always been super understanding and try to make sure they don't bring that peanut bar into work from now on! They also do not want to be responsible for your allergic reaction."

They usually have dedicated people who are first-aid trained and know how to use an epinephrine pen correctly. This is definitely a question you can ask during the interview process or on your first day. To be honest, it did make me feel a lot more at ease knowing there were dedicated people with training in case something took a turn for the worse and I was unable to administer the pen myself. Once the team knew about my allergy blog, they even asked me to do a presentation in front of the company to educate everyone about the seriousness of food allergies!"

With the tester, you can show people the amount of pressure needed for the needle to be activated as well as the correct place to administer it. I’ve found that people are always willing to learn, especially when it's something that could save someone's life. Never hesitate to show people in the office how to use the auto-injector pen, as it could save your life one day."

Sometimes it can be stressful as you have to be super vocal about your food allergy, especially when it involves a restaurant you have not eaten at before. A lot of the time people want to order Indian or Thai food into the office. I’ve had to tell everyone that if it contains nuts, I won’t be able to eat it and it is dangerous for me to be around. One solution to this was actually creating a spreadsheet with restaurants I could safely eat at. This helps people identify which restaurants they can order from and takes away the pressure of having to shout across the office every time. It also let me be able to participate in the team lunch and not feel as though I couldn't be a part of the free food fun!"
