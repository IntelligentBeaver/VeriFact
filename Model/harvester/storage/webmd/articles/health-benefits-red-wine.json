        "Red wine is an alcoholic drink with a deep red color that comes from dark-colored grapes. To produce red wine, winemakers ferment crushed grapes, including the grape skin. Yeast grows and takes in the natural sugars, converting them into alcohol. The grape skin gives red wine some of its color and flavor.",
        "Tannins, which are a group of naturally occurring chemicals found in plant cells present in wine, form during fermentation and are responsible for the wine's bitter but pleasant taste.",
        "There is some evidence that drinking red wine may offer health benefits. If you are a nondrinker, health experts do not recommend that you start drinking alcohol. But if you enjoy alcohol in moderation, red wine is worth considering.",
        "Red wine may be healthier than white wine because of the different fermentation processes. Unlike red wine, most white wine is fermented after the grape skins are separated from the mashed fruit and juice. As many of the antioxidants in grapes are in the skin, red wine contains more antioxidants than white wine."
