        "Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is an antioxidant that your body makes. You also get it from foods such as broccoli , carrots, potatoes, and red meat.",
        "ALA is produced in small amounts in your heart, kidneys, liver, and muscles. It's found in every cell in your body, where its most important job is to help turn food into energy. Because it's an antioxidant, it also protects your cells against damage.",
        "You might also hear alpha-lipoic acid called lipoic acid. It's not the same as alpha-linolenic acid, a heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acid found in nuts and seeds.",
        "How much alpha-lipoic acid should you take a day?",
        "There are no official alpha-lipoic acid dosage recommendations. Doses of 600-1,800 milligrams a day have been used to treat diabetic nerve pain. Daily doses from 200 to 2,400 milligrams are considered safe, but higher doses offer no extra benefits.",
