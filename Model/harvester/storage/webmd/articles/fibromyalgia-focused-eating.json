If you stay hydrated, you are less likely to have symptoms like tiredness, brain fog, headaches, or pain. Experts suggest that you aim to drink about eight glasses of water a day. Avoid coffee, tea, and alcohol. These beverages may worsen your symptoms and disrupt your sleep. Add herbs and spices to dishes",
