        "Fennel is a flowering vegetable and belongs to the same family as carrots and celery . It’s a large plant, with stalks that can grow up to 8 feet tall. Its base is pale and firm, like celery, and its stalks are topped with feathery fronds. You can eat the whole plant — the bulb, stalks, leaves, and seeds — and use it in a variety of dishes.",
        "Fennel has a long history in the Mediterranean region, where it has been used in cooking and medicines. It's common in Italian and Greek cuisines. You can also find it often in Indian, Middle Eastern, and other cuisines around the world.",
        "Fennel taste",
        "Fennel has a sweet, earthy flavor, which is similar to licorice but much milder. Cooking it brings out its sweetness.",
        "Fennel vs. anise",
        "Fennel and anise are related and have a similar licorice-like flavor. They both contain a compound called anethole, which gives them their flavor. But fennel has a milder, sweeter flavor than anise, which has a very strong licorice flavor.",

Fennel has been shown to help with digestion by reducing inflammation in the bowels and decreasing bacteria that cause gassiness.
