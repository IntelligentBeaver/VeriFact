        "1. What is meningitis? Meningitis is an inflammation and swelling of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. These membranes are called meninges. Meningitis is most often caused by an infection. This disease can be fatal or cause serious lasting side effects.",
        "2. What are the causes of meningitis? The two main causes of meningitis are viruses and bacteria. Common bacteria or viruses may cause infection in a part of the body -- the skin , gastrointestinal tract, or respiratory tract, for instance. They then may spread through the bloodstream to the nervous system . Bacteria can also enter the nervous system directly after severe head trauma or head surgery or following an infection in the head. Fungi, protozoa, and other parasites are less common causes of meningitis. In very rare cases, cancer , other diseases, or certain medications may also lead to inflammation of the meninges."

It occurs more often in the winter months A common cause affecting teens is the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis, which causes meningococcal disease . It can be fatal if you don't receive treatment right away. The bacteria that cause it live in the noses and throats of up to a quarter of the population. It is not known why these bacteria sometimes travel to the nervous system and cause meningitis. Another leading cause of bacterial meningitis is Streptococcus pneumoniae .",

Because of its flu-like symptoms, many people mistake it for the flu . Viruses that cause \" stomach flu \" are a cause of vir al meningitis, but most people who have these infections don't develop meningitis. Other viruses that lead to meningitis are those that cause chickenpox, mononucleosis (mono), and herpes . Sympt oms can be similar to those of bacterial meningitis."
