        "May 23, 2024 – Experts have long cautioned against eating late at night, especially a large meal loaded with fats or sugars. Now there’s another reason to listen to their advice: Eating within 3 hours of bedtime at least 4 days a week could increase chances for developing colorectal cancer .",
        "Researchers in a new study questioned 664 people getting a colonoscopy to screen for cancer, and 42% said they were late eaters. This group was more 46% more likely than non-late eaters to have an adenoma – a small noncancerous lesion – found during colonoscopy.",
        "An adenoma is not cancer, but an estimated 5% to 10% of them become cancerous over time. The risk varies based on their location in your GI tract and their size. Doctors search for, measure, and count them during a colonoscopy.",
        "“A lot of other studies are about what we eat but not when we eat,” said Edena Khoshaba, lead investigator and a medical student at Rush University Medical College in Chicago. “The common advice includes not eating red meat, eating more fruits and vegetables – which is great, of course – but we wanted to see if the timing affects us at all.\""
