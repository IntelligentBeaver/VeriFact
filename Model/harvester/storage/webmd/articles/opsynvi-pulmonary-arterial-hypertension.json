        "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a type of high blood pressure in the arteries that go from your heart to your lungs. It happens when these arteries become narrow or blocked, making it harder for blood to flow through them. This forces your heart to work harder to pump blood.",
        "PAH is a long-term condition that can worsen over time. As the heart works harder, it may become weaker and less able to pump blood well. Many people notice symptoms such as shortness of breath, tiredness, chest pain, or swelling in the legs and ankles.",
        "While there is no cure for PAH, your health care provider will work with you to create a treatment plan that fits your needs. Your plan may include medicines that relax or widen the blood vessels in your lungs to improve blood flow.",
        "One option is Opsynvi , which is a pill containing the combination of two medicines: macitentan and tadalafil. Opsynvi is FDA-approved to treat adults with PAH. Macitentan helps delay the worsening (progression) of the condition and lowers the risk of hospital stays related to PAH. Tadalafil improves the ability to exercise. Opsynvi comes as an oral tablet that is taken by mouth.",
