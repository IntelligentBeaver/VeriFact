        "Fatty liver disease, now called steatotic liver disease (SLD), is a condition caused by a buildup of fat in the liver. There are two main types of SLD: metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). You may have heard these conditions referred to as non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) in the past, but those terms are no longer used in the medical community.",
        "An estimated 24% of U.S. adults have MASLD, a figure due at least in part to rising rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes – two major risk factors for SLD. While SLD is common, there are some big differences in how it affects people based on race, gender, and socioeconomic status (how much money they make, their education and jobs, where they live, etc.). There may also be differences in how they are diagnosed and treated based on those things. Such disparities are concerning, as timely treatment of SLD is crucial to avoiding complications, such as cirrhosis of the liver, which can lead to liver failure, liver cancer , and other serious conditions."
