First, you may notice that your dog gets stiffness in their front legs that causes them to limp. The limp is usually worse after exercising and doesn’t go away even after your dog is rested. Cold, damp weather can also affect your dog’s joints. Over time, the stiffness and limp get worse, usually over a period of weeks or months. If both front legs are affected, it might be difficult to notice or diagnose since it might just look like an uneven gait.",

Since elbow dysplasia in dogs is painful and usually leads to canine arthritis , your dog might not be excited to play or even go for a walk.",
