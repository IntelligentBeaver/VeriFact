        "An eye ointment is a kind of medication used to treat or prevent infections in or on your eyes. It delivers a drug, or combination of drugs, in a semi-solid, moisturizing form. The medicine in the ointment might be used for bacterial, fungal, viral or other types of common infections, inflammation , or other eye conditions.",
        "Since you apply an eye ointment right into your eye, it can work faster than medications you take by mouth. It works by breaking down into small drops in your eye and stays in your eye longer than some other types of treatments. Some ointments are available over the counter, but others require a prescription from your doctor.",
        "Eye ointments are a safe treatment option, although they might sting a bit or make your vision a little blurry at first. Always follow your doctor’s advice on when and how often to use them.",
