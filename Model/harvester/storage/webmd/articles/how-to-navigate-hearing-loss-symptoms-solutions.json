        "May 8, 2025 - - Hearing loss is one of the most common changes that comes with aging. But what exactly does it mean to lose your hearing? And how does simply perceiving sound differ from truly understanding it? In this episode, we speak with Douglas L. Beck, Au.D., F-AAA, CCC-A , Senior Director of Audiology at EssilorLuxottica Inc, to break it all down. He walks us through the most common causes of hearing loss, early warning signs and symptoms, how hearing is assessed and diagnosed, and the latest in screening tools and intervention devices. Whether you're noticing changes in your own hearing or want to better understand how it affects someone you love, this conversation offers essential insights into how we hear – and what happens when that ability begins to change."

        "Welcome to the WebMD Health Discovered Podcast. I'm Dr. Neha Pathak, WebMD's Chief Physician Editor for Health and Lifestyle Medicine. Today, we're going to discuss hearing loss. If you've ever thought everyone around you is suddenly mumbling, or you've had trouble following conversations in noisy settings, or you are noticing a loved one has trouble tracking conversations when there's a lot of background noise — you're not alone. Hearing loss can sneak up on us at any age, often without obvious warning signs. For some of us, hearing loss may be caused by age-related degeneration. For others, it may be caused by consistent noise exposure, certain medications, earwax blockages, chronic ear infections, or even head trauma. In this episode, we'll take a step-by-step approach to hearing loss and explore the telltale clues that might signal hearing trouble, the screenings and comprehensive tests available to us, and the surprising way hearing loss can affect mental and cognitive health over time. We will also break down the practical, everyday steps to safeguard your ears — from understanding safe noise levels to recognizing when over-the-counter devices can help, and when it's time for deeper assessment. We'll answer some of your most pressing questions, like: Is that slight hearing difficulty normal as we age, or could it be hiding an underlying condition? How can you advocate for yourself or your loved ones during medical appointments to ensure you get the right tests and solutions?"

        "Pathak: Well, I am very, very excited to jump into our conversation, but before we do, I'd love to ask about your own personal health discovery — your aha moment around working with patients as it relates to hearing loss.",
        "Beck: My aha moment actually started at my fellowship in 1983 or 1984 at the House Ear Institute in Los Angeles. I had the good fortune to be there a few years before the FDA approved cochlear implants for adults. That opened up my eyes to a lot of the neurophysiology and the technology that was about to emerge, and I was at the right place at the right time. I was just so grateful to have been there.",
        "Pathak: I am really excited to talk about this entire range of options that are now available to patients, so thank you for kicking us off with that. But before we do, I'd love to take a step back and just start with the basics. People often think about hearing loss as something that's age-related. Can you talk to us a little bit about hearing loss in general — how we should be thinking about it? Is this really something that we need to start thinking about as we age, or are there things that we should be thinking about throughout our entire lifespan?",
        "Beck: Absolutely. That's such a great question, because people rarely understand hearing loss. Hearing is just perceiving or detecting sound, and probably 90% of all people with significant hearing loss can hear. What they can't do is understand. What they can't do is comprehend sound. What they can't do is make sense of sound."

  "meta_description": "Hearing loss is one of the most common changes that comes with aging. But what exactly does it mean to lose your hearing? And how does simply perceiving sound differ from truly understanding it? In this episode, we speak with Douglas L. Beck, Au.D., F-AAA, CCC-A, to break it all down. He walks us through the most common causes of hearing loss, early warning signs and symptoms, how hearing is assessed and diagnosed, and the latest in screening tools and intervention devices. Whether you're noticing changes in your own hearing or want to better understand how it affects someone you love, this conversation offers essential insights into how we hear – and what happens when that ability begins to change.",
