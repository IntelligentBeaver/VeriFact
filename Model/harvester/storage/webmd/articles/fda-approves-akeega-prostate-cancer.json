        "Akeega is a dual-action tablet combining two medicines — niraparib and abiraterone acetate — that has been approved by the FDA in combination with prednisone (a steroid medicine) for treating men with prostate cancer that has a harmful or suspected harmful BRCA2 gene mutation and has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) but still responds to hormone-lowering therapy. An FDA-approved test is used to confirm the specific genetic changes in this type of prostate cancer.",
        "This form of cancer is termed “BRCA2-mutated metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer” (mCSPC) and tends to progress faster and have fewer treatment options. Most patients become resistant to hormone-lowering treatment, and the cancer progresses to a more aggressive, incurable stage called metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). About 25% of patients with mCSPC have genetic changes like BRCA mutations, which can make the cancer progress about 50% faster and shorten survival.",
        "Niraparib is a type of drug called a PARP inhibitor that works by blocking PARP-1 and PARP-2 enzymes. This prevents the prostrate tumor cells from repairing their damaged DNA, slowing down their growth and eventually destroying them. Abiraterone acetate is a CYP17 inhibitor that works by blocking a specific enzyme required for making male hormones (androgens) in the body. It lowers the levels of androgens circulating in the body, leading to slower growth and spread of prostate cancer cells. When used together, these medicines target prostate cancer cells in two different ways, making the treatment more precise. Prednisone helps reduce side effects from abiraterone and keeps hormone levels balanced, making the treatment safer and easier to tolerate.",
        "Previously approved in 2023 for BRCA-mutated mCRPC, Akeega with prednisone is now also the first FDA-approved precision therapy for BRCA2-mutated mCSPC. This new approval allows the treatment to be started in the earlier stages of the disease before the cancer develops resistance to hormone therapy."

Your health care provider will check your blood counts, liver and kidney function test results, and blood pressure regularly during and after the treatment. Akeega isn’t recommended if you have moderate or severe liver problems and should be used carefully if you have serious kidney issues. It may also affect how other medicines work, especially those processed by certain liver enzymes like CYP2D6.",
