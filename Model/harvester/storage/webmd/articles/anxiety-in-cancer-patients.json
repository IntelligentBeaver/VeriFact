        "Anxiety is a normal reaction to cancer . One may experience anxiety while undergoing a cancer screening test, waiting for test results, receiving a diagnosis of cancer , undergoing cancer treatment , or anticipating a recurrence of cancer . Anxiety associated with cancer may increase feelings of pain, interfere with one's ability to sleep , cause nausea and vomiting , and interfere with the patient's (and their family's) quality of life. If normal anxiety gives way to abnormally high distress, becomes incapacitating, or involves excessive fear or worry, it may warrant its own treatment. In that instance, If left untreated, anxiety may even be associated with lower survival rates from cancer.",
        "Persons with cancer will find that their feelings of anxiety increase or decrease at different times. A patient may become more anxious as cancer spreads or treatment becomes more intense. The level of anxiety experienced by one person with cancer may differ from the anxiety experienced by another person. Most patients are able to reduce their anxiety by learning more about their cancer and the treatment they can expect to receive. For some patients, particularly those who have experienced episodes of intense anxiety before their cancer diagnosis, feelings of anxiety may become overwhelming and interfere with cancer treatment."

Patients may benefit from other treatment options for anxiety, including psychotherapy , group therapy, family therapy, participating in self-help groups, hypnosis, and relaxation techniques such as guided imagery (a form of focused concentration on mental images to assist in stress management), or biofeedback . Medications may be used alone or in combination with these techniques. Patients generally should not avoid anxiety-relieving medications for fear of becoming addicted.
