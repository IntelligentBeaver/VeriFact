        "Rotator cuff tendinopathy is when a tendon in your shoulder has tiny tears in it or is inflamed and hurts. It’s usually caused by overuse or general wear and tear. Sometimes called tendinosis, this type of shoulder pain is more common in people over age 30. If it’s not treated, it can lead to stiffness or weakness in your shoulder and other long-term problems such as a frozen shoulder, which while not permanent, can take a year to resolve.",
        "Each of your shoulders is made up by a group of muscles and tendons called a rotator cuff. This keeps your upper arm inside your shoulder socket. It also gives you the strength and motion to rotate and lift your arms.",
        "The wear and tear on shoulders from repeated overhead activities can lead to recurrent injury and rotator cuff problems. This includes common activities like weightlifting, swimming, tennis, golf, and many physical jobs. While historically this was called tendinitis , that term is now used for more sharp, inflammatory shoulder pain.",
        "People older than age 40 are most likely to have rotator cuff problems, in general. Genes may also play a part. If someone else in your family has shoulder issues, then you may be prone to get them, too."
