        "“The word addiction may seem strong when it comes to food, but research has shown that our brains respond as strongly to highly processed foods, especially those highest in sugar, simple starches, and fat, as they do to tobacco, alcohol and other addictive substances,” researcher Ashley Gearhardt, PhD, an associate professor in psychology at the school, said in a news release . “Just as with smoking or drinking, we need to identify and reach out to those who have entered unhealthy patterns of use and support them in developing a healthier relationship with food.”",
        "Researchers analyzed responses collected in July 2022 from 2,163 people ages 50 to 80 years old as part of the university’s National Poll on Healthy Aging. The study was published Monday."
