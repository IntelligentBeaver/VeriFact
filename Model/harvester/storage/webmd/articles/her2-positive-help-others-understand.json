        "By Marianne Sarcich, as told to Kara Mayer Robinson It may be hard for someone who's never had early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer to truly understand what it's like to have it. With HER2-positive breast cancer, you may have a lot of physical and emotional side effects. Your treatment may go on longer than people think. The emotional burden may last a long time. Through my advocacy and my personal experience -- I have stage I breast cancer -- I’ve seen how important it is to communicate with those close to you to help them understand what you’re going through and what you need."
