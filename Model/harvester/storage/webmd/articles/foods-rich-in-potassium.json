Potassium is available as a supplement, but you should only take it with a doctor’s prescription. Too much can hurt your kidney function. Unless your doctor tells you to, it’s safer and more effective to get this mineral from your diet. Foods high in potassium are also usually high in other nutrients and low in sodium. This balance contributes to potassium’s health-boosting effects."
