But it can impact how you think about yourself and others. Research shows that over 70% of adults with alopecia areata experience depression or anxiety, and about 60% go on drugs to help these symptoms. Almost 13% are at risk of suicide. If you have alopecia areata, it’s very important to keep tabs on your emotions, and, if necessary, get help."

You may worry that your alopecia areata is a hidden sign of cancer or another dangerous disease. The good news is most people who have alopecia areata are healthy. It’s still normal to want to camouflage small symptoms, though. If you have small patches, you can use a hair-colored powder, cream, or crayon. If they are larger, you can try a wig, hairpiece, scarf, or hat. Reduce stress. Anecdotally, some people with alopecia areata report that they notice a new cycle of hair loss after they go through a period of stress. It’s important to try to learn to manage your stress with a technique such as yoga or meditation. Exercise is also a good way to relieve tension. One study found that people with alopecia areata who had more than half of hair loss on their scalp and who stayed active were less likely to report depression, anxiety, or stress than people who were couch potatoes."
