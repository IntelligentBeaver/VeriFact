        "Aug. 10, 2001 (Washington) -- After months of consideration, President Bush has announced that he will allow U.S. funding for studies on embryonic stem cells, but only on more than 60 cell populations that he said had already been removed from embryos in privately funded research.",
        "The decision, Bush says, ensures that no taxpayer money will go to research on cells not yet taken from embryos, since that requires the destruction of the embryo and \"its potential for life\". At the same time, he said, his compromise permits research on a field that scientists say holds huge promise for breakthrough treatments and even disease cures.",
        "\"Embryonic stem cell research offers both great promise and great peril, so I have decided that we must proceed with great care,\" Bush said. The President unveiled his decision in a prime-time evening TV address from his Texas ranch.",
        "Embryonic stem cells are unspecialized, self-renewing cells. Scientists believe that they can multiply and manipulate the cells so that they become brain , heart , pancreas , or many other types of cells."
