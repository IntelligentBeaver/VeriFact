Some, such as the common house spider, are harmless. Others, such as the black widow and brown recluse, are considered deadly. Some species are commonly heard of, including the jumping spider , tarantula, and orb weaver . Others are less common and not frequently heard of, such as the ghost spider. Some favor outdoor areas, like garden beds, while others like sneaking their way into homes.",
