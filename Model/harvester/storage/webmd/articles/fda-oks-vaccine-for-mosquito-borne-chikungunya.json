        "Feb. 18, 2025 – The FDA has approved a new vaccine to protect against chikungunya . This first-of-its-kind shot is approved to prevent this viral disease in people ages 12 and older.",
        "Chikungunya, caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and spread through mosquito bites, leads to fever, rash, fatigue, headache , and severe joint pain. While rarely fatal, it can lead to long-lasting joint pain. The virus is found in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, including popular tourist destinations. In 2024, there were 620,000 cases and over 200 deaths worldwide, highlighting the need for prevention, especially for travelers.",
        "The vaccine, sold as Vimkunya, uses virus-like particles that resemble the CHIKV, without causing an infection or disease. These particles trigger the immune system to produce antibodies, providing protection if you're exposed to the real virus in the future.",
        "The FDA approved Vimkunya under priority review based on two large studies involving over 3,500 healthy people ages 12 and older. Results showed that after 21 days, up to 97.8% of them had antibodies against chikungunya. The vaccine began working within a week, was generally safe, and most side effects were mild to moderate. Common side effects included pain where the needle went in, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain."
