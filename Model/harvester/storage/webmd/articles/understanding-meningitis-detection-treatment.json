        "If your doctor is suspicious your teenager has meningitis, they will send you to the ER where they may get a procedure called a lumbar puncture , or spinal tap. It's the only way to confirm the diagnosis and the presence of the organism responsible for the infection.",
        "During the Lumbar puncture, the doctor injects an area of your teen's lower back with an anesthetic, a drug that suppresses pain while the procedure is going on. The doctor then slips a needle between two vertebrae in the lower spine to get a small sample of spinal fluid. The fluid is normally clear, so if the lab shows it is cloudy and has white blood cells in it, your teen may have meningitis.",
        "Lab tests will help figure out which type of meningitis your teen has -- bacterial, viral, or fungal. Your teen's doctor may also need to get samples of their blood or urine. Because the disease can move quickly, treatment sometimes starts right away, even before the test results come back."
