Some muscle discomfort or “burn” is normal, but stop if you feel sudden or sharp pain, or if your joints feel weak or unstable. Also, while doing any exercise, focus on good form and take a break if you feel your form breaking down because of muscle fatigue . The quality of your reps is more important than the quantity."
