        "Pain can result from a variety of factors. Some types of pain come and go, while others are long-lasting. Non-opioid and opioid medicines can be used to help manage different types of pain. Non-opioid medicines can also include prescription and over-the-counter medicines. Acute pain is a type of pain that comes on quickly but lasts a short amount of time. Journavx (jor-na-vix) was approved in 2025 and is the first non-opioid medicine in its class that is used to treat moderate to severe acute pain."

It may also temporarily affect your quality of life and how you perform day-to-day activities. Depending on your pain level and the cause of your pain, there are different options to treat it. This can include a combination of physical therapy, medicines, exercise, and rest.",

Your brain then processes how you will experience and respond to the pain. Journavx helps to block these sodium channels, which can help stop these pain signals from reaching your brain and can lower the amount of pain you feel."

They could also take ibuprofen as needed for more pain relief. People could participate in the study if they had moderate to severe pain within four hours after their abdominoplasty surgery or nine hours after anesthesia was stopped in their bunionectomy surgery.",
