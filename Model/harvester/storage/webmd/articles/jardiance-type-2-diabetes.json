        "Jardiance lowers blood sugar. Normally, the kidneys filter sugar in a way that keeps it in the bloodstream rather than allowing it to leave the body through the urine. The kidney protein responsible for this process is sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2). Jardiance works by temporarily stopping the SGLT2 proteins from working, allowing more sugar (glucose) to leave the body through the urine. Through this process, it can also cause weight loss and a decrease in blood pressure."

        "Clinical studies were conducted to test if Jardiance was safe and effective for lowering HbA1c (a blood test that shows your 3-month average blood sugar control) and blood sugars in people with type 2 diabetes. Most studies defined a high HbA1c as 7% or higher. The studies focused on adults and children (ages 10-17) with type 2 diabetes. In one study, the effects of Jardiance on type 2 diabetes were studied among people with kidney disease. In another study, the effects of Jardiance on major events like death from heart disease, heart attack, or stroke were studied among people with type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Some studies also looked at the effect of Jardiance on body weight and blood pressure. Jardiance was compared with a placebo containing no medicine and against other diabetes medicines including insulin, linagliptin, metformin , pioglitazone , and sulfonylureas (such as glimepiride).",
        "The studies included people who were White, Black, or Asian, including those who identified as Hispanic or Latino. Most studies did not include people with very high blood sugars (for example, people with fasting readings above 240 mg/dL), people who recently had a heart attack or stroke, people on weight loss medicines or another weight loss plan, or people with liver issues. Only one study included people with kidney issues."

You may need to check your blood sugar more often if you have changes in your diet, exercise regimen, or medicines for diabetes. It can also cause water loss, which can lead to dehydration. Make sure to stay well-hydrated if you are taking Jardiance. Your health care provider may want to have you complete kidney labs to make sure that your kidneys are not impacted by dehydration.",
        "A dangerous condition called diabetic ketoacidosis can happen. When your body cannot use the sugar that you are taking in because you are not making or taking enough insulin, your body uses a process called ketosis to get energy. Ketosis results in a production of chemicals called ketones, which change the pH of your blood and can be dangerous and even deadly. This condition is more likely to occur if you are not eating like you normally do or miss insulin doses. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, or shortness of breath. Your health care provider may ask you to monitor your ketone levels at home (through a home urine test). Stop Jardiance and get medical help right away if you have symptoms of ketoacidosis."
