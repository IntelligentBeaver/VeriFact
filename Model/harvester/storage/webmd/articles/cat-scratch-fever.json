        "Cat scratch fever or cat scratch disease is an infection caused by the bacteria Bartonella henselae. You usually get this disease when an infected cat licks an open wound on your skin or bites or scratches you. Kids and teens are more likely to be infected than healthy adults, but adults with weakened immune systems are at risk, as well.",
        "One way to help prevent cat scratch fever is to keep your cat's claws trimmed. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images)",
        "The most common symptoms of cat scratch fever are swollen, tender lymph nodes, a low-grade fever, and a skin rash. Most cases get better on their own, but you can help ease some of your symptoms with ibuprofen or naproxen.",
        "Kids younger than 5 and immunocompromised adults are at increased risk for complications, which include the infection reaching other organs, such as your liver, spleen, and heart valves. People at risk should take extra steps to avoid getting infected.",

        "About 30%-40% of cats and kittens carry the bacterium Bartonella henselae in their mouths, under their claws, or on their fur. They get infected by scratching or biting at infected fleas . They can spread it to their paws and fur when they lick themselves. Also, flea poop (also called flea dirt) contains the bacteria, as well.
