        "During a physical exam for myasthenia gravis, your health care provider may look for signs such as having a droopy eyelid, a hard time holding your arms out at shoulder length for a reasonable length of time, or a weak grasp. Blood tests may reveal the presence of other less common antibodies. Specialized tests, such as an electromyography (EMG), use electrical stimulation to measure how your muscles respond. In myasthenia gravis, doctors often use repetitive nerve stimulation during the EMG to check for muscle fatigue.",
        "If you have myasthenia gravis, your muscle strength decreases in a predictable pattern during testing. As part of the exam, your doctor may give you a medication such as neostigmine. If you have the condition, this drug temporarily improves your muscle strength, which helps confirm the diagnosis.",
        "Because other conditions sometimes come with myasthenia gravis and can interfere with treatment, your health care provider may order other tests. You may need a CT scan or an MRI to check for a thymoma. You'll be checked for high blood pressure and glaucoma, and you'll probably have your blood tested to see if you have thyroid disease, other autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus), diabetes, kidney problems, or any infections."
