        "Sprained ankles are common injuries among athletes but can happen to anyone. Typically, these injuries occur after a fall or if you twist your ankle, causing the ankle ligaments (the tissues connecting and supporting your ankle bones) to tear or stretch. Most sprains heal independently without medical intervention, but treatment can help speed up recovery and prevent future sprains. One such treatment is known as ankle taping. Read on to learn how to tape a sprained ankle and whether doing so will benefit you."
