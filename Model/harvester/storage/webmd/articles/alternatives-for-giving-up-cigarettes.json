And while many alternative approaches are available -- ranging from acupuncture to guided imagery to self-hypnosis -- they're certainly no panacea, and for every smoker they help, they may leave another one frustrated and feeling a slow burn at the end of the day while they light up their next cigarette.",

But when you examine all of the scientific research, the success stories are interspersed with the disappointments. \"There's really nothing out there that has set itself apart as a winner in the treatment of smoking cessation ,\" says Kiresuk, a professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis."

Using this method, individuals enter a state of relaxation and then create mental pictures that help tap into their unconscious mind and reprogram the nervous system to resist the temptation to smoke.",
        "\"Guided imagery is most helpful in preparing people to quit smoking,\" says Bresler. It can help them get ready on the inside, clearing away internal conflicts and obstacles that can block the path to quitting.",
        "Bresler notes that many people are attracted to smoking by Madison Avenue's imagery that has convinced them that they can feel cool, macho, or seductive if they smoke. Guided imagery, he says, taps into a person's own imagination and helps them create other images that can counter the purported appeal of smoking, showing instead that it is a toxic poison that you're inhaling. \"The key is to break the habit, break the addiction, and recognize that you don't need a cigarette to feel cool,\" he says.",
        "Part of guided imagery's power is its ability to instill strength and resolve to toss those cigarettes aside. \"It is a means of learning to relax, talking to your creative self, and mobilizing and growing your determination and will to make changes that are important to your well-being,\" says Bresler."
