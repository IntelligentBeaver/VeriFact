In fact, during our specialty training, dermatologists study over 3,000 different conditions of the skin, hair, and nails.

        "What Is Ringworm?",
        "Let’s get one thing straight right off the bat – “ringworm” is not caused by a worm. Despite its name, ringworm actually refers to a superficial fungal infection. Many different causative species can affect all ages and various body sites, including your torso, extremities, groin folds, face, and scalp (which can be extra tricky to treat. More on that later). Tinea infections are classified and named based on the body site affected:",
        "Tinea flourishes in warm, humid climates and is spread via direct skin contact with an infected person or animal. Additional risk factors include wearing enclosed shoes or boots (think sweaty feet), using communal spaces such as showers or locker rooms, and having a compromised immune system."

Lesions are scaly, may have a bumpy appearance to them, and are often itchy.",

On your scalp, ringworm may cause scaling, flaking, pus bumps, and can even lead to broken hairs and hair loss. You may also have swollen lymph nodes.",

To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may scrape the scaly part of the lesion with a blade, put it on a glass slide, and look at it under the microscope.

A fungal culture may be used to determine the specific type of fungus causing the rash.

        "How Is Ringworm Treated?",
        "Good news – there are many available treatments for ringworm! Mild cases with just a few lesions are typically treated with topical antifungals, such as ketoconazole and terbinafine creams, among others. The length of your treatment could vary, with some infections clearing fast and some requiring 6 weeks or more of therapy. You can also use diluted vinegar soaks, as vinegar has antifungal properties.",
        "When ringworm fails to respond to creams or is widespread, affecting multiple body parts at once, your doctor may prescribe medication to be taken by mouth. For example, in tinea capitis, topical creams are ineffective, as they do not reach fungal organisms in your hair follicles. So, oral meds are needed in these cases.",
        "Terbinafine, fluconazole, and griseofulvin are commonly prescribed oral medications. The choice depends on suspected organisms and emerging resistance patterns. Oral antifungal medications are known for having interactions with other medications. So, it’s important to tell your doctor about all the medications you’re taking and any prior medical problems before starting oral therapy."
