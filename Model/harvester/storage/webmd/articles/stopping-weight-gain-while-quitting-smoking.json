My doctor told me that he could put me on medication , or I could try seeing if it was lifestyle-related by eating healthier and getting exercise. Considering high cholesterol didn't run in my family and I knew what my lifestyle was like, I decided to try making some healthy changes, and that included quitting smoking .",

I had been completely sedentary -- the only exercise I got was a ski trip once a year and walking around Manhattan.
