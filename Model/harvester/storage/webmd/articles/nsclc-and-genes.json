        "Most non-small-cell lung cancer is caused by smoking, but your genes may also help determine your chances of getting the disease. Lung cancer is when cell growth in the lungs becomes abnormal and cancer cells are created. A gene mutation, or change, can make this happen. Cells normally divide, grow, and may die, at set times. But a gene that changes in a certain way can trigger cells to continue to divide and grow, even when they shouldn’t. This out-of-control cell growth can lead to cancer. Sometimes, a mutated gene that should make sure cells divide slowly or stop won’t, or it won’t make sure that cells die when it’s time. All this can also lead to cancer. Some people have genes that mutate during their lifetimes for different reasons, and those changes can raise their chances of lung cancer. Other people inherit changed genes from their parents. Still others have cells that change for no apparent reason. There are a few different ways that genes -- tiny pieces of your DNA -- can mutate and lead to non-small-cell lung cancer."
