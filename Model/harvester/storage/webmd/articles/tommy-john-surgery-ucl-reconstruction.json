        "Tommy John surgery repairs a torn ulnar collateral ligament (UCL), which is located inside your inner elbow . This ligament connects the bone of your upper arm (humerus) to a bone in the forearm (ulna) and helps keep your elbow stable.",
        "When your UCL is torn, you may feel pain, have less motion in your elbow, or can't throw a ball as hard and fast as you normally can—or at all.",
        "If you've torn your UCL in your elbow, Tommy John surgery can help repair it. (Photo Credit: VectorMine/Dreamstime)",
        "College and pro athletes who play sports that involve overhead throwing are more likely to have a Tommy John injury. Baseball pitchers, who must repeat this motion many times each game, are the athletes who most often need this surgery.",
        "During Tommy John surgery, an orthopedic or a sports medicine surgeon replaces your torn UCL with a tendon taken from somewhere else in your body, usually your forearm or hamstrings. The goal is to stabilize your elbow so you have little to no pain and can move your elbow through a normal range of motion. Athletes often have this surgery so they can return to playing their sport."
