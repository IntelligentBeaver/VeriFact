For some, that may be close to reality, but it’s far from the truth for others. There is a broad spectrum. Regardless of the severity and symptoms, privacy typically allows individuals to live without fear of being judged, scrutinized, or attacked.",

It’s a tough decision to be open about schizophrenia. Should I protect myself from potential prejudice and discrimination, or would I get more help and support by sharing?",
