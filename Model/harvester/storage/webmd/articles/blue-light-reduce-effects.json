        "Blue light -- the kind from your smartphone, tablet, TV, and even energy-efficient light bulbs -- is not necessarily damaging to the eyes but can trigger eyestrain and lead to a range of health issues. These include cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, poor sleep, and mood disorders.",
        "Since ditching all digital devices isn’t a realistic option, here are a few tips to ward off blue light’s effects.",
        "Cut down on screen time. Taking regular breaks from computer or TV screens rests your eyes and limits blue light exposure. Every 20 minutes, look away from your screen and focus on an object 20 feet away. Do this for at least 20 seconds.",
        "Take a break from blue light at night. Screen breaks are most important in the evening. Try to power down your devices at least 3 hours before bed. This can help stop blue light from affecting your body’s release of the sleep hormone melatonin. More melatonin means better sleep.",
        "Get new glasses. Computer glasses with special lenses can lower exposure. The yellow-tinted lenses increase contrast on your screen, filtering blue light and easing digital eyestrain. More research is needed to know how well blue light-blocking glasses work. But one small study found that people who wore glasses with filtering lenses had less eyestrain, blurred vision and dry eyes after long screen times. Another found that filtering lenses helped with melatonin suppression. Melatonin is the hormone that regulates sleep. Blue light slows or stops your body from releasing it. Lenses with anti-reflective coatings may also help by reducing glare, increasing contrast and blocking blue light."
