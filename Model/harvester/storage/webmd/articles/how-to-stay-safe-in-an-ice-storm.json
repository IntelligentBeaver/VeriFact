        "What causes an ice storm? Ice storms happen when there are 3 layers of the atmosphere at significantly different temperatures. The uppermost layer is cold enough (below 32 degrees Fahrenheit) to create snow. The middle layer is warmer and turns the snowflakes into raindrops. The bottom layer, and the ground, are cold again, turning the rain into ice. Once it lands on the cold ground, it creates a frozen layer that can be hazardous. Ice can also form quickly during a rainstorm when the ground temperature is at or below freezing."
