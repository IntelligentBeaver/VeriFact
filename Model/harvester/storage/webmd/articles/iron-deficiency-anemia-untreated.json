        "About 1 in 4 people worldwide have some type of anemia . Iron-deficiency anemia, the most common form by far, makes up about half of all cases. Women and very young children get it the most. In fact, about 1 in 10 women of childbearing age, and nearly that many kids aged 1 to 3, have this condition. Iron-deficiency anemia is treatable. You can bring your iron back up with iron-rich foods, supplements, or medicine, depending on the cause and your doctor’s recommendations. But leaving it untreated can lead to a number of complications -- and even death. Here are eight problems iron-deficiency anemia can cause. Just as the name implies, iron-deficiency anemia happens when your iron is too low. Iron helps make hemoglobin, a substance in red blood cells that allows them to carry oxygen all over your body. When you don’t have enough iron, you won’t have enough hemoglobin to do this important work. If oxygen can’t get to the rest of your body, you may feel tired and short of breath as a result."

        ". Anemia lowers the amount of oxygen that reaches your brain. This can cause arteries in the area to swell, which leads to headaches. Iron-deficiency anemia may also trigger migraines in women. This could be because iron helps keep levels of brain chemicals such as serotonin, dopamine , and norepinephrine stable. When iron is low, these hormones can fluctuate and trigger a migraine headache . Heart problems . Untreated anemia can cause a rapid or irregular heartbeat. It also puts a lot of stress on your heart. Anemia lowers your red blood cell count. When you don’t have enough red blood cells, your heart has to pump a lot more blood to make sure that enough oxygen gets to all your organs. That extra work can hurt your heart and lead to an enlarged heart or heart failure. Restless legs syndrome . A small number of people with restless legs syndrome also have a condition that causes iron deficiency, like anemia. Doctors aren’t sure what the link is, but one theory is that low levels of iron decrease levels of dopamine, a brain chemical that helps control muscle activity and movement. MRIs of people with restless legs syndrome have shown that some have lower levels of iron in the part of the brain where dopamine-making cells live."

Research shows that if you have low iron when you receive a vaccine, your body can’t generate an immune response to it. This makes the vaccine less effective and makes it harder for you to fight off diseases such as COVID-19.
