B cells are an essential part of the immune system; their role is to create antibodies that protect against infection. In relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), B cells enter the brain and make antibodies that target the myelin, the protective coating around the nerves. B cells also activate T cells that join the attack on the myelin. It creates the relapsing-remitting symptoms that are the hallmarks of RRMS."

The treatment, also called B-cell-depleting monoclonal antibodies, targets B cells that attack the immune cells while preserving protective antibodies. Studies have shown that B-cell therapy is \"highly effective\" against RRMS and have been shown to reduce relapses and slow disease progression. But additional research found that B-cell depletion therapy doesn't resolve chronic active lesions in MS, and those lesions play a major role in the clinical progression of MS. It means that your MS-related disability may get worse even if the number of relapses goes down while you receive B-cell therapy."
