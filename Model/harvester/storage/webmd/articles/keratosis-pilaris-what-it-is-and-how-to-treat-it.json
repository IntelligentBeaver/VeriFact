        "Keratosis pilaris (KP) is a very common benign skin condition characterized by numerous small red or brown bumps involving the hair follicle. You may have even heard of this before, as it’s often referred to as “strawberry skin” or “chicken skin.” These bumps are rough in texture and sometimes associated with scaling.",
        "They appear most often on the upper arms and thighs but may also be found on the cheeks and buttocks. A key feature of KP is that it tends to be symmetric, occurring on both sides of the body simultaneously. Though these bumps typically don’t cause symptoms, some people may find them irritating, itchy, or just plain bothersome to look at.",
        "KP is most prevalent in children, adolescents, and young adults. Because it is so common, many consider KP a variant of normal skin.",
        "What Causes Keratosis Pilaris?",
        "KP is caused by the plugging of hair follicles with keratin, a protein important for the structure and function of your skin, hair, and nails. KP has been associated with filaggrin gene mutations, the same gene mutations found in people with atopic dermatitis (also known as eczema). In fact, KP affects more than 40% of people with eczema."

        "If you have low levels of functioning filaggrin, you may also have problems with your skin being able to retain moisture. It’s also not surprising that KP gets worse with cool weather, low humidity, and dry skin. In addition, there’s also a genetic component to KP. Members of the same family often exhibit identical skin problems. In this case, KP is thought to be passed on via an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.",

However, if you are looking for ways to treat your KP, there are options available that may help to improve the appearance of your skin. It’s important to note that most cases do get better with time, especially if you have it on your face. This area tends to get better during puberty."
