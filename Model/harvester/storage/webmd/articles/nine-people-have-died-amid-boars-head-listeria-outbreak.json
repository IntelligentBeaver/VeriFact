People in 18 states have been sickened: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The most illnesses were reported in New York, where 17 people were sickened, followed by Maryland with eight and New Jersey with five.",
