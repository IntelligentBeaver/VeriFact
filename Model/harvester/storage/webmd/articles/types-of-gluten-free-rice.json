        "Rice is a nutritious grain and staple food in more than 100 countries around the world. It’s high in starch, a type of carbohydrate that is a main source of the body’s energy. It's also low in cost, which makes it a good base for many meals.",
        "All natural forms of rice, including white, brown, or wild, are gluten-free. Natural rice is a great option for people who are sensitive to or allergic to gluten, a protein usually found in wheat, barley , and rye, and for people who have celiac disease , an autoimmune disease triggered by gluten.",
        "Sometimes, rice can be cross-contaminated with gluten, meaning that it’s been grown, harvested, or processed near or in the same facilities as wheat , barley, or rye. Rice sold in bulk bins, such as at a grocery store, may also be cross-contaminated. This may happen when customers mix the scoops between bins. For example, a shopper might use the flour scoop in the rice bin, which could contaminate all the rice with gluten."

        "Is jasmine rice gluten-free? Yes, that's right. Jasmine is another fragrant long-grain rice. When cooked, jasmine rice becomes soft and slightly sticky.",
        "Is brown rice gluten-free? Yes. This is a short-grain rice with a chalky white opaque kernel. When cooked, sweet brown rice becomes very sticky and loses its shape.",
        "Is arborio rice gluten-free? That's correct. Arborio rice is used mostly for risotto and rice puddings. It is a medium-grain rice that has more starch because it isn’t milled as much as long-grain rice. The starch is released when it is cooked, which makes the rice creamy but not mushy. You can find both white and brown arborio."

But you should still check to be sure your rice wasn't processed or stored in bulk near other grains with gluten if you need to avoid even trace amounts of gluten. Many rice dishes also may have other ingredients in them with gluten, so it's a good idea to check labels carefully or ask.",
