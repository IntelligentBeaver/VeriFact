        "Acai – sometimes written as açaí – is an inch-long, reddish-purple berry that comes from a South American palm tree.

Some companies have marketed a cai berries as a superfood that can help reverse aging and aid with weight loss. But do they live up to the hype?",
        "There's no formal medical definition of a superfood. But the term generally refers to a food that's high in healthy nutrients like fiber or antioxidants. Acai seems to fit the bill, since studies show that acai fruit pulp is even richer in antioxidants than cranberries, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, or blueberries. Acai, pronounced ah-SI-ee, also contains fiber as well as other vitamins and minerals.",
