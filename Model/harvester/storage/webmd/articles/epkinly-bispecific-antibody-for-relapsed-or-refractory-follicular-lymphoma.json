        "Epkinly (epcoritamab-bysp) is a type of cancer treatment called a bispecific antibody that helps your immune system find and destroy certain cancer cells by connecting immune cells (T cells) to cancer cells (B cells). Epkinly is now approved to be used with two other medicines – rituximab and lenalidomide – to treat adults with a form of blood cancer known as follicular lymphoma (FL) that has come back (relapsed) or didn't respond to earlier treatment (refractory).",
        "The FDA has also granted full (traditional) approval for epcoritamab-bysp alone for FL that has returned or not responded after at least two previous treatments. This monotherapy use previously held an accelerated approval in 2024.",
        "FL is a slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that arises from B lymphocytes (B cells). While it may respond to treatment at first, it often returns, and the remissions get shorter each time. In some cases, it can turn into a more aggressive type of lymphoma, which is harder to treat and linked to poor survival. About 15,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with FL each year."

        "Why Was It Approved?",
        "Epkinly was approved because a clinical study involving people with FL that had come back or didn't respond after at least one earlier treatment showed that the Epkinly, rituximab, and lenalidomide combination worked better than standard treatment.

In comparison, 74% of people responded to R2 alone, and 43% had no signs of cancer after treatment.
