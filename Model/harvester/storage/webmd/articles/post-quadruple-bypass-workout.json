        "Lynn Swassing was just 48 years old, the mother of two sons in high school              and one daughter in college, when she had a heart attack in 1987. She              underwent quadruple bypass surgery and was hospitalized for nearly six              weeks.",
        "Every single day, at some point, the hospital had an exercise specialist at              the foot of my bed, she recalls. They told me, if you don't get active, you              won't make it.",
        "No way,was Swassing's first thought. The full-time mom had never been on a              treadmill in her life, and she figured the gardening and housework she did at              her four-story Omaha home were enough of a workout.",
        "But she gave it a try. After just 10 minutes on the exercise bike, she was              ready to quit. For good. They want me to do this for the rest of my life? Are              they kidding? she reports thinking. But I kept at it, and after two weeks I              felt like a new person."

If there's one single thing a heart patient should do long term, it's a brisk              walk three to five days a week, says Philip Ades, MD, director of cardiac              rehabilitation at the University of Vermont School of Medicine.",
        "Weight training also has              significant benefits for people with heart disease.

Keep your torso straight, and bend your knees and lower body toward              the floor. Do not let your front knee bend over your toe. Push back through              your front heel to come back up. Repeat 8-10 times, then switch legs. Starting              out, heart patients should do just one set, twice a week.",
