        "Maintain a healthy weight. Extra pounds can make ADPKD get worse faster. Your doctor or nutritionist can recommend a healthy diet to help keep your weight under control. More research is needed, but one small study found that fasting (only eating within an 8-hour window) can help you lose weight and slow the advance of ADPKD. Eat a low-salt diet. Too much sodium makes your kidneys work harder, which can quickly make symptoms of ADPKD worse. Eat less than 2,000 milligrams of sodium daily unless your doctor suggests a different amount. Watch the phosphorus you eat. ADPKD can make phosphorus build up in your blood. Over time, too much of this mineral can damage your bones and organs. To avoid having too much phosphorus, eat more fruits and vegetables instead of packaged foods. When you buy boxed or canned foods, check the labels and avoid anything that has added phosphorus or ingredients starting with “pho.”"
