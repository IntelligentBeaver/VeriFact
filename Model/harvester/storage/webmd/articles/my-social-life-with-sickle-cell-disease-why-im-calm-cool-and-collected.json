I must look within to understand how sickle cell disease affects my social life. What is my personality, and how do others perceive me? Reserved, calm, and quiet are adjectives that have been used to describe myself at some point, and they're accurate. I usually step out of my shell only when I'm around people I'm comfortable with or in a one-on-one situation. I am more reserved in group settings and take a back seat to others.",
        "It's understandable why people would describe me this way. I can think of countless examples when I've displayed these characteristics. However, I've always wondered how much of it is because of who I am and how much is due to my chronic condition. Physical, emotional, and mental stress all negatively impact my body. The impact of these stresses influences how I manage my life with sickle cell disease and how I interact with others."

The young kid jumping around at exciting news grew up to be an adult who would wait until an event happened before showing any excitement.",

These passions have helped me go back against the limits I had placed on my excitement.",

However, I am a tranquil person and it's difficult for me to appear overwhelmed or stressed because neither of these emotions is beneficial when managing sickle cell disease. I can feel my body responding negatively when I have strong negative emotions."

Now, I'm learning to process these emotions healthily to avoid the potential repercussions for my health.",

I always thought that this is just how I am, but I regress even further after a crisis. It takes a lot of energy to project my voice and be loud, so it is part of the emotional defense mechanism I've developed to maintain a calm status quo.",
