Plan ahead to make travel safe and smooth. Talk to your care team to see if travel is safe for you. Ask your doctor if there’s anything you need to do while traveling. Make sure that you pack enough medicine to last a few days beyond your trip, in case of delays. Carry your medication with you, not in a checked bag. Also, make sure it's in its original packaging. Always bring a note from your doctor for controlled drugs.",
