        "For many years, anyone with breast cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes automatically got chemotherapy. This treatment stops or slows the growth of rapidly dividing cancer cells, yet it’s not without downsides. In addition to well-known side effects like nausea and hair loss, it may also cause nerve damage, lead to cognitive issues, and raise the risk infections -- among other problems.",
        "Yet chemo was our hammer, and when you have a hammer, everything is a nail. For a while it was the best -- and only -- means we had to fight against cancer that appeared to be spreading. But using it so often meant that many people were being overtreated and getting all of the downsides without many, if any, benefits. A landmark 2018 study revealed that up to 70% of women with [certain types of] breast cancer could safely forgo chemo.",
        "Nowadays, when a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, we discuss not only the size of the tumor and the stage of the cancer but also the tumor’s characteristics: What’s driving it, and how aggressive is it? That helps us figure out how aggressive to be when treating it. We also have to factor in a woman’s age and, perhaps more importantly, whether or not she has gone through menopause ."

As with TAILORx, the RxPONDER trial found that the majority of postmenopausal women did not receive benefit from chemotherapy. For premenopausal women under age 50, however, the addition of chemotherapy made a significant difference: Five years after treatment, 94% of the premenopausal women who opted for chemotherapy plus hormone therapy did not have invasive canc­er (compared to 89% of those who only had hormone therapy ).",

For women who are younger, the chemo-induced absence of periods is more apt to be temporary, though it’s still wise to discuss fertility preservation if you hope to have children in the future.",
