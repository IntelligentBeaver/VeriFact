        "Bea Sacks of Huntington Woods, Mich., calls Jack, her adult cat, “big.” But she has no idea how much he weighs or whether a diet is in order. That’s because Jack, like many housecats, eats whenever he wants and rarely visits the veterinarian . Unfortunately, if Jack is even a pound over his ideal weight, he could be in trouble. Overweight cats are far more likely to develop osteoarthritis , type 2 diabetes mellitus, respiratory problems, and non-allergic skin conditions.",
        "If you can hear a thud when they jump off the bed, you should consider putting your cat on a therapeutic cat diet, modifying your feeding habits, and getting them to move more. It’s a good idea to see a veterinarian first to rule out other issues. Plus, the vet can help you formulate a sensible weight-loss and exercise plan. What the vet can’t do is restrain your urge to reward your cat with treats or to give in to their mewling when you change their diet. Keep in mind: a slimmer, fitter cat is a happier and longer-lived cat."
