        "Some cancer cells have what are called checkpoint proteins known as PD-L1 on their cell surface. Some immune cells in our bodies called T-cells have proteins on their surface that bind to PD-L1. When these proteins bind to each other, the T cells in our body get turned “off,” which stops them from killing cancer cells. Keytruda acts on proteins on the T cell and prevents these proteins from binding to PD-L1 proteins on the tumor cell. This turns the T cell back “on” and allows it to do its job of attacking and killing the tumor cell."

People in this trial got either pembrolizumab plus chemoradiotherapy (chemotherapy plus radiation) or placebo plus chemoradiotherapy. There were 1,060 people in this study, and half were in each group. Five hundred ninety-six people out of the 1,060 had advanced (stage III or IV) cancer. This study looked at progression-free survival (PFS), which looked at how long people lived without their cancer growing. The median age of those with advanced cancer was 52 (range 22-87). Seventeen percent of people were over 64. In this study, 36% of people were White, 34% were Asian, and 1% were Black. After 12 months, 81% of people in the pembrolizumab group were alive without progression of their cancer versus 70% in the placebo group."

Exercising each day, even if it is just for a short time, can help boost your energy.

Your doctor may be able to give you medicines to treat other side effects such as depression, pain, or low blood counts, which may help with your fatigue.",

They will decide whether you should stop taking Keytruda. They may also recommend creams or antihistamines to help with your rash and itchiness. Skin reactions are a common side effect of Keytruda and can happen at any time after you start taking it and even after you stop. You may also be given a corticosteroid to treat your rash."
