        "Lynparza is a type of medicine known as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. PARP is a certain protein that helps cancer cells survive and grow. It does this by repairing cell functions of the cancer cells such as DNA transcription and DNA repair. Lynparza inhibits, or blocks, the PARP protein and prevents it from repairing the DNA of cancer cells, which causes the cells to die."

        "BRCA is an inherited gene. When BRCA is mutated, you may be at an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. You can take Lynparza for BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer that is advanced (it has spread beyond the initial tumor but has not spread to other parts of the body) and that has been treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and had a response to the chemotherapy. For this type of ovarian cancer, Lynparza can be taken as a first-line maintenance treatment, meaning you would take it after you finish your chemotherapy. Lynparza can also be used to treat BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer that is recurrent (the cancer returned after treatment) and that has been treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and had a partial or complete response to the chemotherapy. Lynparza is also taken as a maintenance treatment for this type of cancer, meaning you would take it after you finish your chemotherapy.",

        "The FDA approved Lynparza to treat BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer that is advanced and has been treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and had a response to the chemotherapy in a clinical trial called SOLO-1. In this trial, people either took Lynparza or a placebo. A placebo is used in clinical trials as a control so that the potential benefit of a medicine in a group of people can be compared in a similar group of people who did not receive a medicine. The clinical trial included 391 people, with 260 of them taking Lynparza. There is no information available about the races of the people who took part in the clinical trial.  They were followed to see how long it took for their cancer to progress, meaning that the cancer grew or spread. This measurement is called progression-free survival. At 3 years after starting treatment, 69% of people who took Lynparza had not had their cancer grow or spread, compared to 35% of people who took the placebo. This study also looked at how long people in the study who received a certain medicine survived or needed to move on to a second-line of treatment after starting to use the medicine. The median time it took for people to need to move to a second-line treatment or who died was 51.8 months (over 4 years) for people who took Lynparza, compared to 15.1 months for the people who took the placebo. This means that half of the people who took Lynparza were still alive and did not need the next line of treatment at 51.8 months."

In this trial, people either took Lynparza or a placebo. A placebo is used in clinical trials as a control so that the potential benefit of a medicine in a group of people can be compared in a similar group of people who did not receive a medicine. The clinical trial included 391 people, with 260 of them taking Lynparza. There is no information available about the races of the people who took part in the clinical trial.  They were followed to see how long it took for their cancer to progress, meaning that the cancer grew or spread. This measurement is called progression-free survival. At 3 years after starting treatment, 69% of people who took Lynparza had not had their cancer grow or spread, compared to 35% of people who took the placebo. This study also looked at how long people in the study who received a certain medicine survived or needed to move on to a second-line of treatment after starting to use the medicine. The median time it took for people to need to move to a second-line treatment or who died was 51.8 months (over 4 years) for people who took Lynparza, compared to 15.1 months for the people who took the placebo. This means that half of the people who took Lynparza were still alive and did not need the next line of treatment at 51.8 months.",
