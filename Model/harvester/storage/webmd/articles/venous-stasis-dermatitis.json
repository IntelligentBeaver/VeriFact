        "Venous stasis dermatitis is a condition in which your veins, usually in your lower legs, have trouble pushing blood back to your heart. This causes fluid buildup and blood leakage into the skin, leading to symptoms like swollen ankles , varicose veins , itching, and pain. It's more common in older adults, especially women and those with circulation issues. Treatment involves surgery or medications, along with lifestyle changes such as wearing compression stockings, elevating your legs, regular exercise, and proper skin care."
