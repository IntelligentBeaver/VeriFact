        "Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a condition that you might get if you've regularly smoked weed or used marijuana in some other form for a long time. CHS causes you to have repeated episodes of vomiting, severe nausea, stomach pain, and dehydration. You're more likely to get CHS if you use marijuana at least once a week and have been doing so since you were a teenager. \"Cannabinoid\" refers to cannabis (marijuana) and \"hyperemesis\" is a word meaning \"prolonged vomiting.\"",
        "Some heavy marijuana smokers eventually get cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome and can't stop vomiting. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images)",
        "CHS is not just a side effect of marijuana use. It’s a serious medical problem that can cause major health issues if you leave it untreated. It can bring on severe dehydration. If you have any symptoms of severe dehydration, like dizziness, confusion and a rapid heartbeat, call 911 right away.",
        "How rare is CHS?",
        "CHS was first described as a medical condition in 2004. Although it was considered to be rare, the number of cases has increased with the legalization of marijuana in many places and the opening of retail stores to easily get it. This has increased both the number of people using the drug and the \"high\" in the available weed.",
        "One 2018 study found that 3 2.9% of self-reported frequent marijuana users who'd gone to the emergency room (ER) had symptoms of CHS. And a 2022 Canadian study found that ER visits for CHS-related problems had increased 13-fold between 2014 and 2021. (Recreational use and sale of cannabis in Canada was legalized starting in 2018). It's not clear what percentage of all heavy marijuana users have experienced CHS."
