        "Luqman Seidu, MD, is board certified in allergy & immunology as well as pediatrics and specializes in the diagnosis and management of adult and pediatric patients with allergic diseases including food allergies, eczema, hives, asthma, eosinophilic diseases, allergic rhinitis, hives, and drug allergy. He serves as an adjunct professor in department of pediatrics at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. Prior to starting his own practice, he served as faculty in the department of allergy/immunology at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and worked in the Cincinnati Center for Eosinophilic Disorders.",
        "Before starting his fellowship, he completed a three year allergy/immunology fellowship at the co-joint program at the Cincinnati Children’s Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. He started his fellowship with laboratory research training and was the first fellow at Cincinnati Children’s to be trained under the T32 grant by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Seidu had his fellowship structured to include basic science laboratory research and training during all three years of his training; focused on molecular biology research his first year with concurrent clinical responsibilities. His second and third years were structured to include protected time for continued bench molecular and clinical science research while expanding his clinical patient responsibilities. Just before his fellowship, he completed residency at a Rainbow Babies Hospital affiliate program and graduated from an accelerated, combined BS/MD program in northeast Ohio.",
        "He has been first author or co-author on several basic/molecular science and clinical publications in peer-reviewed journals on immune regulation in the intestine, allergic intestinal disease, eosinophilic diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, drug allergy, immunology and clinical allergy. Seidu has participated as a primary investigator or co-investigator on several clinical research studies dealing with immunodeficiency, immunoglobulin replacement, and the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis and other eosinophilic disorders. He has spoken many times across the country about eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders and food allergy. He has served as reviewer for numerous journal articles related to allergy/immunology as well as gastroenterology.",
