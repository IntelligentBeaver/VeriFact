After my own personal experience with depression during my 20s, I’ve been on a lifelong quest to both understand and help others. I spent almost a decade at the National Institutes of Health searching for ways to predict which depression treatments may be most effective for different people.

        "My approach to TRD involves offering support from multiple angles. I don’t just focus on depression meds, but on an overall strategy that includes: Dietary changes Exercise Medical evaluation with comprehensive bloodwork Medication Neuromodulation Psychotherapy Restorative sleep Supplements and vitamins, especially if we find a deficit First, I find out the details of previous treatments. It’s important for your doctor to understand how your symptoms evolved and how you responded to previous treatments. Your doctor may ask which medications you tried, the doses, how long you used them, and if you had side effects. Then I look at the broader medical picture. Could there be other factors at play? Do you have good sleep habits, diet, and exercise? I may recommend supplements, vitamins, and medication to improve day-to-day life. For example, vitamin D or omega-3s may help with mood improvement. I also address the constant negative self-talk that comes with depression. Finally, I look for a combination of medications and neuromodulation to help your brain function in a more harmonious way."

        "In the last 15 years, we’ve had a welcome introduction of different evidence-based strategies to treat TRD. They involve medication and techniques involving brain stimulation or inhibition, which is called neuromodulation. Medication . For TRD, we go beyond classic depression medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). We may use medications like tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, thyroid hormone, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). We may combine these with other medications, like atypical antipsychotics, buspirone, or other mood stabilizers. The combination of options is enormous. Ketamine is an old anesthetic drug that’s been shown to help relieve TRD within hours. This is a big difference from typical depression meds, which may take weeks. There’s been some controversy around ketamine, but it offers hope for severe cases with limited options. Neuromodulation . This is a treatment strategy that uses physical methods, like electric currents, to stimulate your brain. One type is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). It’s been poorly portrayed in movies and has fueled misinformation and distrust, but it’s a very safe and effective method to treat depression. ECT sends a small dose of electricity through your brain to change your brain chemistry and reverse your symptoms."

        "Light therapy is a well-established treatment option for people whose depression may be seasonal. If your mood deteriorates in the fall months, it may have a seasonal component. Light therapy can ease symptoms, improve sleep, and increase energy. It depends on the device, but your doctor may recommend using light panels or goggles every morning for about 20-30 minutes, starting in the fall. Psilocybin, or “mushrooms,” has been studied as a possible depression treatment for many years. It’s not clear if it’s better than traditional antidepressants, but it may have fewer side effects. It may be an option if you’ve tried other things and they didn’t work. Talk to your doctor to see if it's a good option for you. Nitrous oxide (N2O), commonly known as “laughing gas,” may help with depressive symptoms. It’s fast-acting and may be similar to ketamine. But there’s no clear strategy yet for how to use N20 for depression. This may change in the near future as more research is being done now."
