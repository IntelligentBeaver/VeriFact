        "Iron-deficiency anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). It happens when your body doesn't have enough iron. You need iron to make the protein hemoglobin, which helps your red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. That’s why anemia can leave you tired , weak, and short of breath. Not only can iron-deficiency anemia affect your quality of life, it can also damage your heart."

        "Anyone can get iron-deficiency anemia, but it's more common in people with chronic kidney disease. Anemia also tends to get worse the longer you have kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease has 5 stages. About half of people with chronic kidney disease in stages 2 through 5 have an iron deficiency. You can become low in iron in 2 ways: through diet and blood loss. Chronic kidney disease makes it harder for your body to absorb iron from foods like spinach and meat. Dialysis for chronic kidney disease can cause blood loss, as can having numerous blood tests. Low iron can lead to anemia."

        "To complicate matters, your kidneys play a role in red blood cell production. In addition to filtering waste and extra water out of your blood, your kidneys make a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO). It tells your body to make new red blood cells. Damage from chronic kidney disease prevents your kidneys from making enough of this hormone. When your EPO levels are low, your red blood cell count drops and you get anemia. While chronic kidney disease alone can give you anemia, you're more likely to get anemia if you have chronic kidney disease and another risk factor such as: Diabetes High blood pressure or heart disease You're over age 60 You're Black"
