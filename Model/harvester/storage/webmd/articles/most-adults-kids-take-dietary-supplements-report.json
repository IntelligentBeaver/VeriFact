        "April 18, 2023 – More than 1 in 3 children and nearly 3 in 5 adults take dietary supplements in the United States, a new report shows.",
        "The new figures continue a 15-year trend of small, steady increases in how many people in the U.S. use the products that can deliver essential nutrients, but their usage includes a risk of getting more nutrients than recommended. In 2007, 48% of adults took supplements, and that figure has reached nearly 59% in this latest count.",
        "The new report looked at whether people took a multivitamin, as well as other more specific supplements. Among children and adolescents ages 19 and under, 23.5% took a multivitamin, while 31.5% of adults reported taking one. The most common specialized supplement that people took was vitamin D.",
        "The report, released today by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, compiled survey data from 2017 through 2020 in which 15,548 people reported their household’s usage of dietary supplements. Dietary supplements include vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other botanicals that are taken by mouth in pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid form. The researchers said the vitamin and supplement market is large and growing, totaling $55.7 billion in sales in 2020."

Women and girls were more likely to take supplements than men and boys, although there were similar usage levels for both genders among 1- to 2-year-olds.
