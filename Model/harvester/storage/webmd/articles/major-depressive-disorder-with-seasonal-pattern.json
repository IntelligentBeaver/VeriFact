When it came time to print the newspaper, Claire had no articles to turn in. Over the next two months, friends stopped calling her. When Claire complained that no one invited her to sit with them at football games or attend weekend sleepovers, her parents became concerned.",

She also mentioned that she had gained weight since August, and that her appetite for carbs, especially chips and cookies, had greatly increased.",
        "After doing a physical exam , Claire’s doctor ruled out other problems that cause fatigue and mood changes and diagnosed Claire with seasonal affective disorder , or SAD, a disorder now classified by the DSM-5 as Major Depressive Disorder with Seasonal Pattern."

Because light modifies the amount of melatonin in the human nervous system and boosts serotonin to the brain , light therapy has an antidepressant effect.
