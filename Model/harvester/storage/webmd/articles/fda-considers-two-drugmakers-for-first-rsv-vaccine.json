GSK's vaccine was 82.6% effective in preventing lower respiratory tract disease in people over 60, and 94.1% effective in preventing severe disease. Pfizer's was 66.7% effective in preventing RSV-related lower respiratory tract illness with over two symptoms, and 85.7% effective against those with more than three."
