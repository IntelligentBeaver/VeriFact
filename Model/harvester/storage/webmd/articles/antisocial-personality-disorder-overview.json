Someone with the disorder may act rashly, destructively, and unsafely without feeling guilty when their actions hurt other people.",

It is a severe form of ASPD.They can be deceptively charismatic and charming. By contrast, \"sociopaths\" are somewhat more able to form attachments to others but still disregard social rules; they tend to be more impulsive , haphazard, and easily agitated than people with psychopathy. ASPD affects 2% to 4% of the population and is more common in men."
