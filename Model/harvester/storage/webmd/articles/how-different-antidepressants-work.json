        "Antidepressants were first developed in the 1950s to treat the symptoms of depression, which is a mood disorder that causes deep feelings of sadness and hopelessness. But antidepressants aren't just for depressive disorders. In the U.S., some are also FDA-approved for people who have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social phobia, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). And they may be used off-label for conditions such as chronic pain, insomnia, and migraine. Off-label means it's not yet FDA-approved for those conditions, but your doctor may prescribe it because they think it can help you.",

However, the truth is that even experts aren't sure exactly how they work because there's still a lot we don't know about how the human brain works.
