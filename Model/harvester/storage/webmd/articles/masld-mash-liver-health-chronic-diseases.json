        "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and its more advanced form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), have a link to chronic diseases, especially metabolic syndrome. This is a group of conditions that happen together and raise your risk of other chronic conditions, such as Obesity Type 2 diabetes Insulin resistance Hypertension Metabolic disorders such as dyslipidemia (high levels of fat in the blood) Not only do MASLD and MASH affect your liver, but they also increase the likelihood of diseases in your heart and blood vessels. Inflammation and buildup of fat in the liver can lead to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and heart disease. When liver disease worsens, it can cause severe liver problems such as fibrosis (scarring), cirrhosis (severe scarring), and even liver cancer. In the United States, experts think that between 75 million and 100 million people have MASLD. Hispanic people are among the most affected. Experts believe that nearly half of this population has metabolic syndrome and liver disease – and many are unaware of it."

If you have high blood pressure, it can cause MASLD to worsen faster. MASLD adds to plaque buildup in your arteries, raising your risk of heart attacks and strokes. People with MASLD may get ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy (a disease that weakens heart muscle), and arrhythmias.

This may mean that MASLD may make kidney disease worsen faster, even without other risk factors such as hypertension or type 2 diabetes. Obstructive sleep apnea: This is when your breathing becomes irregular or stops during sleep. When it happens, it lowers oxygen levels in your blood and affects vital organs.
