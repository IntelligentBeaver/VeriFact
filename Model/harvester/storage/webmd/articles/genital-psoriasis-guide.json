        "These two conditions can cause similar symptoms. Genital psoriasis is an autoimmune condition, and you can't get it through sexual contact. Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a virus. Herpes sores start as small clusters of blisters. They may break open and ooze fluid. As the sores heal, scabs may form. You may have flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, exhaustion, and muscle pain. Over time, your symptoms with each outbreak may become milder. Pain or tingling in your genitals can be an early sign of an outbreak. To make a diagnosis, your doctor may have to take a sample of the affected area and have it checked by a lab for the herpes virus. It's not always possible to tell what's causing a rash just by looking."

You can get it from contaminated clothing or towels. Because it's caused by the same fungus as athlete's foot, you also can spread it by touching your feet and then your groin. Jock itch spreads outward, often in a ring-like shape, and the center may start to clear up even as the rash is spreading."
