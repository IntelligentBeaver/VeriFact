        "Even though some rates of infection and hospitalization from COVID-19 are thankfully going down in parts of the country, there’s still a possibility every day of catching the virus as it waxes and wanes.",
        "How COVID-19 affects the eye is still not totally clear, but we know that the virus can be present on the surface of the eye and in some secretions like our tears, which indicates a risk of transmission through ocular tissue.",
        "When an infected person coughs or sneezes, those droplets might also enter the membranes of the eye. We think the most common symptom of COVID-19 infection is conjunctivitis , more commonly referred to as pinkeye. In reality, though, there are lots of conditions that cause a pink or red eye, from bacteria to allergies to viruses. However, just like the common cold or allergies, nasal or eye symptoms can likely occur in COVID-19 infection, too.",
        "One question that has commonly come up is whether contact lenses can be safely worn, since they are placed directly on the eye. It’s important to know that contact lenses won’t give someone COVID-19, but the American Optometric Association reinforces that they can be safely worn only with proper care, such as having good contact lens hygiene, washing your hands frequently, and not touching or rubbing your eyes."

        "Most eye care practices actually closed their doors and offices for routine eye care during the initial surge of the pandemic in March 2020. This left a lot of our patients without access to eye exams, glasses, and their contact lens prescription, in some cases for several weeks.",
        "While we found creative ways to help, such as telehealth or online ordering, it still posed a risk for some without full access to care. Things are pretty much back to normal now, but those creative options have stuck with us and have actually increased and improved access for many aspects of eye care delivery."
