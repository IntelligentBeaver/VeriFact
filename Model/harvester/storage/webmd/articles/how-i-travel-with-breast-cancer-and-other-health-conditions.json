I won’t lie, the anxiety was running high; however, I was able to overcome all those feelings mostly by breath work and, of course, checking my bags at least a couple of times just to make sure I wasn’t leaving anything I needed behind. In addition to breast cancer, I have type 1 diabetes and adrenal insufficiency.  Both are considered to be chemically induced and permanent due to the immunotherapy I received for cancer treatment.  So my traveling checklist consists of the following items:",

These are the very first things I pack, and I make sure to account for everything again before I leave my house. It is extremely important that I am aware of medical centers or hospitals wherever I travel in case of an emergency. It’s also important that when I get to my destination or beforehand, I exchange emergency contact information with the people I will be visiting or staying with."
