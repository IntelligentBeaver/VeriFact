        "Radiation therapy, often used to treat tumors, is another possible treatment option for TGCT. It can be used before surgery to shrink the tumor to a more manageable size or instead of surgery. However, it’s uncommon to use radiation therapy now for this type of tumor. There aren’t many studies to prove that it’s helpful, and doctors are worried that possible risks of complications, such as joint stiffness, joint damage, fibrosis (thickening or scarring of the tissue), and a higher risk of a later cancer caused by the radiation, outweigh the benefits.

External beam radiation This is the type of radiation therapy most people think about when they hear \"radiation treatments.\" For this treatment, a radiation beam is delivered directly to the area where the tumor is. Getting radiation therapy isn’t all that different from getting an X-ray, but it takes longer – about 15 to 30 minutes for each session. You’ll lie down on the treatment table and the radiation therapist lines up the beam to the spot where the tumor is. Then, you’re asked to lie still as the radiation therapist starts the machine.

There are two types of radiation therapy that doctors have used to treat TGCT: external beam radiation and radiosynoviorthesis. External beam radiation This is the type of radiation therapy most people think about when they hear \"radiation treatments.\" For this treatment, a radiation beam is delivered directly to the area where the tumor is. Getting radiation therapy isn’t all that different from getting an X-ray, but it takes longer – about 15 to 30 minutes for each session. You’ll lie down on the treatment table and the radiation therapist lines up the beam to the spot where the tumor is. Then, you’re asked to lie still as the radiation therapist starts the machine. Once the treatment is done, you can leave.",

Research shows that patients who have radiosynoviorthesis are at higher risk of developing serious complications like early-onset arthritis and osteonecrosis. Tumor embolization, a procedure where a doctor blocks a blood vessel so it can’t supply a tumor with oxygen and nutrients, causes some tumors to stop growing, shrink, or die. It  is another option for some people with TGCT. Your doctor may choose a tumor embolization if you can’t have surgery."

        "Watchful waiting, or active surveillance, is one other option for people with a certain type of TGCT called diffuse-type TGCT that are asymptomatic. This approach is used for different types of tumors and cancers. If your doctor suggests watchful waiting, you won’t be getting any active treatment, like medications or radiation therapy, but you will be watched closely to see if your tumor changes or grows. Over half of people with TGCTs get them again. So no matter what type of treatment you get for TGCT, there is a good chance that the tumor will come back. Regular follow-ups with your doctor can help you find them in the earlier stages."
