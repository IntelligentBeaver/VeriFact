        "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in adults over the age of 50. As more and more people reach the age of 65, the numbers will grow even more. In fact, it’s predicted that the number of early AMD cases may double, from just over 9 million in 2010 to almost 18 million in 2050.",
        "Unfortunately, there are very few ways to treat it. There are two options that can slow down vision loss from wet AMD: injections and a laser treatment known as photodynamic therapy. But there is no way to treat dry AMD, which is the more common form and affects 85% to 90% of people who have AMD.",
