        "Skytrofa (lonapegsomatropin-tcgd) is a long-acting version of human growth hormone (hGH). It is already approved for children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and is now approved for adults with GHD. It slowly releases somatropin, the active form of hGH, over a week. This allows you to use once-weekly injections instead of daily shots. GHD in adults is a rare condition that can lead to increased body fat, high cholesterol, insulin resistance, and lower quality of life. These issues may raise the risk of heart disease and other serious health problems. Daily injections have been the standard treatment for over 25 years. Weekly treatment with Skytrofa may make it simpler to take your medicine regularly, which can lead to better health over time."

        "The approval was based on a study that compared weekly doses of Skytrofa to a placebo and daily somatropin in adults with GHD. People who received Skytrofa once a week had a greater decrease in fat around the trunk area than those who got a placebo. They also gained more lean body mass and had improved levels of IGF-1, a hormone that shows how well growth hormone is working. The most common side effects were swelling from fluid buildup and low thyroid hormone levels."

        "Skytrofa is given once a week as an injection under the skin using a special auto-injector. The starting dose depends on your age and whether you take oral estrogen. Your health care provider may adjust your dose monthly based on your response and levels of IGF-1. You should not use Skytrofa if you have active cancer, certain eye problems from diabetes, or if you are seriously ill. It may affect how other medicines work, including insulin, oral estrogen, and some steroids. Common side effects include swelling, joint pain, and changes in thyroid or blood sugar levels. Your health care provider may check your thyroid hormone levels with blood tests. Contact your health care provider if you have headaches, vision changes, or new skin changes."
