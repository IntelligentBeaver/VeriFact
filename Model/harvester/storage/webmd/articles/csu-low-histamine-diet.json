        "Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is when large areas of your skin break out in welts: red or skin-colored, usually very itchy, burning, circular, raised blotches. You may also have angioedema , or swelling that affects deeper layers of your skin. Hives can appear anywhere on your body. Angioedema may cause your eyelids, lips, tongue, hands, and feet to swell. Chronic hives come back again and again. And when they do, they usually stick around for a while. Welts appear on most days of the week. Flares may last for six weeks or longer, but some people have hives for months or years."

        "What we do know: Hives happen when mast cells – a type of white blood cell – in your skin become activated for some reason. They release a chemical called histamine that spreads through your skin tissue and irritates nerves. That’s why your hives itch so badly. Histamine also makes very small vessels in your skin widen and leak blood. That’s why hives on your skin look blotchy and swollen. Your body may send a signal to your skin mast cells to release histamine when it senses something wrong. For some people, eating foods rich in histamines may set off this chemical release. About 1% of people, most often in middle age, have strong physical reactions to histamines in foods. They not only break out in hives, but may also have other severe symptoms: Belly pain, diarrhea , or gas Asthma Headaches Sneezing Watery eyes Rapid heartbeat Low blood pressure"

Your doctor may consider other causes for your hives: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and aspirin , and isoniazid /doxycycline for acne, can interfere with how your body breaks down histamines in foods. If you take these medicines, foods you eat may release more histamine and trigger hives. Low vitamin D levels. CSU may be linked to low levels of vitamin D. In 2018, a large, pooled analysis of 14 studies showed that vitamin D deficiency is much more common in adults, but not children, who get hives.

There is one blood test to check for antibodies seen in chronic urticaria, but it’s not widely available. Your doctor may order one or more of these lab tests: Complete blood count (CBC) test to check for signs of inflammation Skin prick test to see if you’re sensitive to any ingredients or foods Thyroid function tests, which can show if you’re low in thyroid hormone. If you have a sluggish thyroid, antihistamines or steroids you take to relieve your hives won’t work as well. You may need to take a thyroid hormone replacement pill. If you also have GI symptoms, like stomach upset or diarrhea, along with hives, your doctor can test a sample of your stool for signs of a parasite infection."
