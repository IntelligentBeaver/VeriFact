        "If you have fibromyalgia, you may also face challenges in your sex life. You could be experiencing a loss of libido or having difficulty with sexual performance. It's also possible your libido is healthy, but the deep muscle pain and stiffness of fibromyalgia keep you from enjoying sex the way you used to.",
        "It's not unusual for people with any chronic illness to complain about having problems with their sex life. But a healthy sex life is important for many reasons. Not only does sex strengthen an intimate relationship, but sexual activity boosts endorphins. Those are the body's natural opioids that help decrease pain and increase well-being. Talking openly with your doctor and following a few practical tips can help you resolve problems associated with fibromyalgia , pain, and sex. Then you can begin to enjoy this aspect of your life again."
