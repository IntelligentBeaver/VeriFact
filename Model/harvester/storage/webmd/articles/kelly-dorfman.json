        "Kelly Dorfman, MS, LN, LD, is a health program planner and nutritionist with 20 years of clinical experience. She specializes in developing strategies to address complex medical problems from autism to bone loss to rare genetic disorders. Physicians refer cases to her for insight when traditional methods fail. Because of doctor referrals and positive word of mouth, she has a successful practice with an international clientele.",
        "Dorfman?s special talent for integrating information from many sources and finding practical solutions has created a great demand for her as a speaker and workshop leader. She has led workshops or lectured in over 20 cities. Sponsoring groups have included doctors, therapists, optometrists, international associations, and schools.",
        "Some of her travel has been as a spokeswoman for the nonprofit organization Developmental Delay Resources (DDR), which she co-founded. The purpose of the DDR is to educate parents, teachers, and health professionals who deal with children with attention, behavior, and cognitive challenges. The DDR provides information and training in nondrug interventions that address the root causes of these conditions.",
        "Dorfman uses creative problem solving in dealing with many health issues but has done groundbreaking work with the rare genetic disease pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). The International PXE Association asked her to explore ways to prevent blindness in its carriers. She presented her experimental protocol at their last international meeting.",
        "Further, she sits on the advisory board of several national organizations and served, by governor appointment, for four years on the Maryland Board of Dietetic Practice. Her formal education includes a master's degree in nutrition and biology.",
