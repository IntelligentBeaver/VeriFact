        "People have been passing along home remedies for inducing labor for as long as people have been having babies . Once you get near, or even past, your due date, you will probably have everyone from your best friend to perfect strangers in the grocery store suggesting ways you can induce labor. While many methods are harmless, if ineffective, there are some that can actually be dangerous. Chamomile tea is often suggested as an easy way to get your labor started. However, there is currently not enough scientific evidence to support that, and some healthcare providers recommend that pregnant women not take chamomile.",
        "In 2013, a study was done in Iran on the effects of chamomile for inducing labor. In this study, 80 post-term women who had low-risk pregnancies were divided into two groups. One group of 40 was given 1,000 milligrams of chamomile every 8 hours for 1 week.  The other group was given a placebo. After a week, 92.5% of the women in the chamomile group started having symptoms of labor. Only 62.5% of women in the placebo group had symptoms of labor.",
        "However, a systematic review of studies done in 2019 recommended that herbal medicines, including chamomile, be discouraged until more evidence of its safety is available. This review found that chamomile use in the third trimester was linked to increased incidents of babies being born early, being shorter, and having a lower birth weight, although a different study did not show an increase in babies born with a low birth weight."
