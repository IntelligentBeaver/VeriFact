However, the ability of a fabric to block UV rays is based on a variety of factors and is measured using ultraviolet protection factor (UPF). UPF indicates how much of the sun’s rays are absorbed by the fabric before it reaches your skin. A typical white cotton T-shirt has a UPF of 5 to 7. But clothing with UPF labels offer optimal protection at a UPF of 50. Nowadays, there are an increasing number of fashionable options for athletic, leisure, and travel UPF clothing.",
        "Sun-Protective Behavior",

        "Hot summers not only increase the risk of UV-related skin concerns, but higher summer temperatures can also exacerbate chronic skin conditions such as acne and eczema. For acne-prone skin, summer can mean increased skin congestion and breakouts. Using cleansers with chemical exfoliants such as salicylic acid can help unclog pores after sweating and exercise.",
        "Avoid scrubbing the skin or using mechanical exfoliants (such as harsh beads), which can disrupt the skin’s barrier and irritate the skin. It’s also important to moisturize with non-comedogenic moisturizers that are free of oils and shea butter.",

        "Most swimming pools contain chlorine to kill bacteria. Frequent and prolonged exposure to chlorine in swimming pools can be drying for the skin, and for those with eczema, this can be a recipe for an eczema flare-up. To restore hydration with increased pool use during the summer, rinse off with a cool shower immediately after getting out of the pool.",
        "Using a mild hydrating cleanser will help restore your skin’s pH balance, but if you don’t have access to a cleanser, rinsing off with water will do. After rinsing off, apply a moisturizer to hydrate your skin barrier. And if you still plan to stay outside, reapplying broad-spectrum sunscreen is a must."
