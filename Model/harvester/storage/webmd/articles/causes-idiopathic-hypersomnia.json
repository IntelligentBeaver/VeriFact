        "Idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) is a rare neurological disorder. Treatment can help, but there’s no cure. You may snooze upwards of 9 hours a night without feeling refreshed. You may fight to wake up in the morning. Your sleepiness may persist or get worse, even when you take lengthy naps during the day. If you live with IH, you’d probably like to know what’s causing your symptoms. Unfortunately, that’s not  something experts have figured out yet. “Literally, the name idiopathic hypersomnia means you’re sleepy and we don’t know why,” says Sabra Abbott, MD, assistant professor of neurology and sleep medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Lots of sleep specialists are trying to solve the IH puzzle, including Lynn Marie Trotti, MD, associate professor of neurology at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. Sleep disorders tend to run in families, so your genes likely have something to do with it. But Trotti says she and her colleagues still don’t know the main source of all this extra sleepiness. “The big mystery really is what causes idiopathic hypersomnia,” Trotti says."

        "We don't yet know why people with IH are so sleepy, or why the disorder causes cognitive symptoms like brain fog, memory troubles, or poor attention. But thanks to ongoing research, Trotti and Abbott say there are some emerging clues, including: Something triggers your GABA -A receptors. These are neurotransmitters that inhibit your central nervous system . Drugs like benzodiazepines can activate them. Doctors use these kinds of meds to treat anxiety and insomnia . Trotti says people with IH sometimes have higher levels of natural benzodiazepines in their spinal fluid. “And the fact that there’s a difference suggests that (GABA-A receptors) might be related to the sleepiness in idiopathic hypersomnia,” she says. There’s ongoing research into this theory. But Abbott says the idea is that something in your body acts like an all-day sleeping pill. “That’s helpful for when you’re trying to go to sleep, but not when you’re trying to be awake during the day.”"

With that said, Trotti says about 20% of people with hypersomnia also have chronic fatigue syndrome. But a careful history of your symptoms can help your doctor figure out what’s going on. They might ask: What do your night and day schedules look like? How much time do you spend asleep? How much time do you spend resting but awake? How much time do you spend trying to function while tired? Sleep tests are also helpful. When it comes to hypersomnia, your doctor will see if: You fall asleep fast during a daytime nap You sleep more than 11 hours in a 24-hour period Trotti says you wouldn’t expect the above symptoms if you have chronic fatigue syndrome without a hypersomnia disorder."
