        "Chagas disease is an infection from the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi — carried by kissing bugs, which are more prevalent in Latin America (South America, Mexico, and Central America) but also found in the southern United States.",
        "Roughly the size of a penny, kissing bugs typically bite at night, often around the mouth (hence the name).",
        "Estimates suggest that about 300,000 people in the U.S. are infected with Chagas, and most caught it abroad. Just 29 confirmed and 47 suspected human Chagas infections were acquired in the U.S. from 2000 to 2018, in California, Arizona, Texas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, and Arkansas. But experts say the actual U.S.-originating cases may be higher — closer to 10,000, some estimates show. Early symptoms, such as fatigue and achiness, are easy to miss — and often there are no symptoms. “Most people who have the infection never become symptomatic,” said Caryn Bern, MD, MPH, professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco. The infection is treatable with antiparasitic medication. But if left untreated, it lasts for life. Unchecked inflammation from the disease can lead to serious outcomes. Studies show that 30% of people with untreated infections develop heart problems, such as heart failure or sudden cardiac death. About 15% to 20% develop digestive complications, such as an enlarged colon (which can lead to severe constipation and blockages requiring surgery) or a swollen esophagus, causing reflux and pain while swallowing. Another 5% develop neurologic complications, such as nerve damage marked by numbness and tingling in the hands and feet. Some may develop more than one complication . How Does It Spread? Kissing bugs spread the parasite by defecating while feeding on your blood, often near your mouth and while you sleep."
