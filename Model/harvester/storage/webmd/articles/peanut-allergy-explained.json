        "You have a peanut allergy when your body’s immune system overreacts to peanuts. Normally, your immune system helps protect you from germs and other harmful substances. But if you have a peanut allergy, your body responds to the proteins in peanuts as though they're dangerous. Your immune system works hard to fight them off, which triggers an allergic reaction .",
        "A peanut isn’t actually a nut. It’s a legume and belongs to the same family as peas and lentils. A peanut allergy is different than a tree nut allergy. Still, up to 40% of people who are allergic to peanuts are also allergic to tree nuts such as almonds, cashews, and walnuts.",
        "Peanuts are often hard to avoid. They can sneak their way into recipes or packaged food items. But even a trace of peanuts can be harmful. That’s why people with peanut allergies need to be extra careful about what they eat.",
        "More than 6 million Americans are allergic to peanuts. Roughly 1 in every 50 kids has a peanut allergy, making it the most common type of food allergy in children. Some grow out of it, but others have a peanut allergy for their whole lives. It's the third most common food allergy among adults.",
        "It's not clear why, but reported cases of p eanut allergy have increased in recent years. A 2017 study found the number of children with peanut allergies had increased by 21% since 2010."
