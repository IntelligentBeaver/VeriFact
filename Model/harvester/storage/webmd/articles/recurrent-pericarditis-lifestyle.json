This means that you have another episode of acute pericarditis that happens at least a month after your first episode. About one-fourth of patients who had a pericarditis episode will have another within two years, and 15% will have multiple recurrences.

This will allow them to: Keep a close eye on your heart Watch for symptoms of a recurrence Create a plan to treat your pericarditis and to prevent another recurrence When you had your original episode of pericarditis, your doctor most likely did a thorough workup to see if you had an underlying health condition that triggered your symptoms. Oftentimes, the initial cause of pericarditis is a viral infection. But other conditions that could lead to it include: Heart attack Surgery An inflammatory condition like lupus Kidney failure Cancer If your pericarditis was due to any of the above, your doctor will want to refer you to a specialist who can help treat the condition."
