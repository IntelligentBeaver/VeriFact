        "Tendons are strong bands of tissue that connect muscles to your bones. Sometimes, calcium builds up in them and causes a condition doctors call “calcific tendonitis.” Calcium deposits feel like toothpaste. They can collect in one spot or spread out around the tendons. Doctors don’t know what causes them. But they do know they’re more common in women than in men. It typically happens around age 30. And research shows there’s a link between calcium deposits in tendons and diabetes and thyroid disorders .",
        "Often, calcific tendonitis doesn’t cause problems. But if the calcium deposits get bigger or become inflamed, they can cause severe pain.",
        "This condition most often affects the shoulder. The calcium deposits usually form in the rotator cuff -- a group of muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint. It keeps the top of your upper arm bone locked within the socket of your shoulder. Calcific tendonitis can also happen on the Achilles tendon. This connects your calf muscle to your heel bone. You can get it in your wrist, hip, thigh, knees, ankle and foot, too."
