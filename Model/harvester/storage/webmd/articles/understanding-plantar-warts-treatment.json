        "Deciding how to treat your plantar wart may depend on your ability to tolerate the pain of various treatments. Folk remedies for treating warts abound, and there is no single treatment that works every time. Softening of warts under prolonged duct tape occlusion is sometimes effective. Conventional treatment focuses on removal, while alternative approaches emphasize gradual remission. Whatever you do, do not try to cut off a plantar wart yourself because you may injure yourself and cuts in your skin allow the warts to spread."
