However, if taken in excess amounts (overdose, whether on purpose or by accident), acetaminophen can cause life-threatening illness. Unless otherwise directed by your care provider, the usual maximum recommended dose is 3 grams in 24 hours.",

Acetaminophen is in Alka-Seltzer Plus ,  Co- Gesic , Contac , Excedrin , Fioricet , Lortab , Midrin , Norco , Percocet , Robitussin , Sedapap , Sinutab , TheraFlu, Unisom PM Pain, Vick's Nyquil and DayQuil , Vicodin , and Zydone .",

Indeed, NAC can prevent liver failure if given early enough. For this reason, it is absolutely necessary that acetaminophen poisoning be recognized, diagnosed, and treated as early as possible."
