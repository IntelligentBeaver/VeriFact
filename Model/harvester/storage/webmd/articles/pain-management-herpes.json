        "In the United States, about 48% of teens and adults under age 50 have herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), the kind that most often causes mouth sores. About 12% have herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), the kind that most often causes genital sores. Worldwide, the numbers are higher: 67% for HSV-1 and 13% for HSV-2. Herpes infections last for life, so most older adults worldwide likely have herpes simplex.",

Canker sores usually show up as round white or yellow sores surrounded by a red ring. They can be on your inner lip, inner cheeks or tongue. You can’t pass canker sores to another person."
