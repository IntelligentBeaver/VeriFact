        "Your doctor will recommend they test your tumor for genetic mutations. To do this, they look at your tumor under a microscope and run tests on it. Two better-known examples of genetic mutations that affect your cancer risk and treatment options are BReast CAncer gene 1 (BRCA1) and BReast CAncer gene 2 (BRCA2). If you have these genetic mutations, you were most likely born with them. But other genetic mutations can also affect your breast cancer risk, treatment, and progression. PIK3CA, AKT1, and PTEN are three genes that play a role in how cancer grows. Knowing if you have changes in them can help guide your treatment choices. PIK3CA and AKT1 genetic mutations aren't changes you were born with. They happen in your cancer cells.  PTEN genetic mutations can either be inherited (you’re born with them) or develop later in life. Here’s what these specific mutations mean: PIK3CA helps control how cells grow and survive. When it’s mutated, it can cause cells to grow too fast, which can lead to cancer. About 30%-40% of people with HR+/HER2- breast cancer have a PIK3CA mutation. Luckily, there are drugs made just for this. For example, alpelisib (Piqray ) is a targeted therapy that blocks the overactive PI3K pathway. Your doctor may combine it with a hormone-blocking drug called fulvestrant if your cancer comes back or spreads after other treatments. AKT1 helps with cell growth. A mutation in this gene also affects a pathway that controls how your cells grow and survive. AKT1 is like a switch that tells cells to keep growing. If it's stuck in the “on” position, cancer can grow more easily. A drug called capivasertib (Truqap) can help block the “on” switch. PTEN works like a brake pedal, slowing down the effects of PIK3CA and AKT1. It stops cells from growing too quickly. If it’s missing or not working right, cancer cells can grow unchecked. PTEN mutations are more complicated. There isn’t a specific drug made just for this mutation, but your doctor may still use an AKT inhibitor (such as capivasertib) as part of your treatment, or they may suggest you join a clinical trial ."
