        "Exclusive pumping is when you feed your baby with only pumped milk , rather than direct breastfeeding or nursing.",
        "In practice, you express (or squeeze out) milk from your breast using a pump and then put the milk inside a bottle. You then feed your baby using the bottle or a nasogastric tube (if they are premature). Just as you would when breastfeeding, you follow a pumping routine based on when your child needs to feed, or you can express a lot of milk and store it in the fridge to warm and use it later when the baby needs it.",
        "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that breast milk be the only source of nutrition for the baby’s first six months. This may be either through breastfeeding or through feeding pumped breast milk. After six months, the AAP recommends continuing to feed breast milk, along with introducing other foods, as long as you and the baby want to continue. This could be for two years or longer.",
        "Breastfeeding may also be called chestfeeding.  According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, the language used about lactation can be gendered, and people may prefer “chestfeeding” because it better reflects their identity.",
        "Pumping exclusively is a way to provide breast milk for your baby without feeding directly from your breasts. People have different reasons for choosing to pump exclusively, including that it allows more than one person to feed the baby. Having a pumping schedule is key to exclusive breastfeeding, to make sure that you keep your milk supply up. (Photo Credit: The Image Bank/Getty Images)"

Electric pumps vary in size, and some come with a carrying case that looks like a handbag.",
        "Hospital-grade pumps. This pump is used in a hospital setting when you are separated from a prematurely born baby . Hospital-grade pumps are more consistent than standard pumps and have been shown to increase milk production, Jones says. So, if you need strong stimulation to produce enough milk, you may rent a hospital-grade pump from a hospital or lactation consultant. You may need to rent it for only a short time, until you get your milk supply up, and then you can go back to your own pump, Jones says.",
        "Wearable pumps. These are small, powered pumps that fit into your bra. They don’t need to be held in place. They’re made to be discreet so you can go about your activities while pumping, and others may not notice that you’re pumping. “Wearable pumps have been a complete game changer for so many people,” Jones says. But you may need to pump longer to get the same volume of milk, such as 20 or 30 minutes rather than 15 minutes with a standard pump, she says."
