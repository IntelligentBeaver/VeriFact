        "And let’s be honest, who wants to feel suffocated by their clothes? Plus, I still manage to look put-together. No saggy pants here!",

That’s when I look for easy-to-wear pieces like elastic waistbands, pullovers, and tops with no fastenings. These items are perfect for when I need to get dressed without breaking a sweat, yet still look polished and stylish.",
        "I love how a loose tee or a dress that just slips on can create that effortlessly chic vibe I’m always after. And bonus points if it’s oversized – comfort and style in one!",
        "As much as I love a good pair of heels, MG has definitely changed how I think about shoes. Unfortunately, no more strutting around in high heels, which used to be my go-to for nights out. Now, I go for shoes that combine support with style.",
        "Brands have finally caught on to the fact that comfort doesn’t mean dowdy, and I’ve discovered orthopedic-inspired trainers (many Adidas trainers are actually orthotic-friendly; I live in my Adidas Astirs), slip-on loafers, and wedges/platform shoes. These shoes give me that extra lift when my legs are feeling weaker, but they don’t skimp on the fashion factor."
