More than that, it helps you carry your body weight when you stand and move. Your femur is critical in helping you maintain stability so you don’t fall over easily.",
        "The femur also contains bone marrow, which is a soft, fatty tissue made up of stem cells. Stem cells have two unique abilities that make them essential to survival — they can make more stem cells, and they can “morph” or develop into other types of cells (this process is called “differentiation”).",

Red bone marrow cells produce all the components of your blood (red and white blood cells and blood platelets). Yellow bone marrow cells store fat, which is needed for energy and to produce bone, cartilage, and muscles. From birth to around age 7, your bones contain only red marrow. From then on, yellow bone marrow gradually replaces red."
