        "April 29, 2025 – Prostate cancer is the second-deadliest cancer among U.S. men – and it's on the rise. More than 300,000 men are diagnosed with the condition each year, a number that's been climbing by 3% annually since 2014, according to the American Cancer Society.",
        "The reasons come down to a few different things. Screenings have gone up, so more cases are being identified. People are living longer, and with prostate cancer, the number of new cases increases dramatically with age – from 0.2% among men under 50; to 2% for men over 50; 5% over 60; and 9% over 70. Although most cases are diagnosed early and progress slowly, one in 44 men will die from it.",

        "The name, which combines \"therapy\" and \"diagnostics,\" hints at the treatment's dual purpose: to identify cancer lesions and kill them on the spot with targeted radiotherapy."

        "The basic detect-and-destroy principle of theranostics dates back to the 1940s , with the use of radioactive iodine to treat thyroid cancer. But recent advances in imaging technology and cancer treatment have led to huge strides in the field. Big drug companies like Novartis and Lilly have invested billions in developing or acquiring radiopharmaceuticals, the radioactive drugs that make theranostics possible.",
        "The diagnostic part of theranostics involves tests – often a PET scan – where a radiopharmaceutical drug known as radiotracer is infused into the patient and binds itself to cancerous cells, revealing them through the scans. For prostate cancer, the radiotracer binds to prostate-specific membrane antigens (PSMA) expressed by the cancer cells.",
        "Following the same pathway, a therapy then targets the cancer cells, destroying them with precision while sparing most healthy tissue.",
        "\"We can deliver a high radiation dose to that specific area and maintain it within only one to two millimeters,\" said Daryl Eber, MD, a diagnostic radiologist and nuclear medicine doctor in Miami. He owns and operates 3T Radiology & Research , a private practice that's acquiring the technology to start offering theranostics to patients."
