        "May 4, 2023 -- Dangerous chemicals are found in dozens of everyday consumer products, according to a new survey.",
        "The chemicals were found in more than 100 products commonly used in homes and workplaces, says the study, which was published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. They have been linked to cancer, and reproductive and developmental problems.",
        "These products include nail polish, shampoo, lotion, soap, all-purpose cleaners, laundry detergent, and dishwashing soap. “The largest group of products were those that might be used in workplace settings, such as factories or construction sites, and included adhesives, degreasers, lubricants and sealants,” The New York Times reported.",
        "Researchers cross-checked two databases maintained by the state of California. The first was a list of products containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These are chemicals that turn to gas and go into the air easily. The second list was chemicals that cause cancer or reproductive and developmental problems. These were identified by Proposition 65, California’s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act."
