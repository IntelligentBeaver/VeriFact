        "Aug. 22, 2001 -- Two years ago, actress Kellie Martin's 19-year-old sister Heather suddenly began to suffer from fatigue , an odd skin rash , and a slew of unexplainable health problems. Her symptoms stumped doctor after doctor. The doctors diagnosed her with one illness, then a different one, then yet another, as Heather's friends and family watched the formerly healthy teen become gravely ill.",
        "The doctors couldn't reach a consensus on Heather's ailment. \"They would stand out in the hall and argue about what the best way to treat her was,\" says Martin. \"In the meantime, Heather was getting weaker and sicker. It was infuriating.\" Finally a doctor diagnosed Heather with systemic lupus erythematosus, also called lupus .",
        "With lupus, like other autoimmune illnesses, the patient's immune system goes into overdrive and mistakenly attacks the body it is designed to protect. In Heather's case, her body was killing her own kidneys and other vital organs, mistaking them for foreign objects.",
        "Though Heather's disease might seem unusual, 50 million Americans -- 75% of them women -- suffer from autoimmune disorders , according to Virginia Ladd , president and founder of the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association Inc., or AARDA. Because of the threat these illnesses pose to women's health worldwide, the AARDA is currently working with both the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women and the World Health Organization to have autoimmune disorders declared a major women's health concern."

Researchers like Rose hope to find some answers soon. \"The research of the past decade is adding up. Combined with the new research into the genetic code, we are very hopeful that there will be a breakthrough within the next 10 years,\" he says."
