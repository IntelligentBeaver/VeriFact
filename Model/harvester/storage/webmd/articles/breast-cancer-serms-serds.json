        "When the hormone estrogen attaches to the receptor, it sends signals that tell the cell to grow. SERMs block estrogen receptors in the breast so that estrogen can't attach to the cancer cells and help them multiply. These medicines are called \"selective\" because they block the action of estrogen in breast cells, but can turn that action on in others. Many other types of cells also have estrogen receptors, including cells of the bones and uterus."
