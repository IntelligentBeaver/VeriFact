        "When patients come to my office, the most common question asked is, “What is the best routine for my skin?” Hands down, I will always recommend a topical retinoid. I usually start my spiel with, “Topical retinoids are the gold standard for healthy skin.” Beyond their recognized benefits in acne, there is a strong anti-aging effect in their ability to even the skin’s texture and tone. This one product packs a big punch.",
        "Topical retinoids are a class of medications that are molecularly similar to vitamin A, an essential vitamin crucial in normal body functions. It is a fat-loving molecule that readily absorbs into your skin. Retinoid use dates back to ancient Egyptian practices, using the liver (which contains retinoids) to treat night blindness.",
        "In the 1960s, a synthetic form called tretinoin was FDA-approved for treating acne. It was later discovered there was an added anti-aging benefit of reduction of fine lines and overall improvement of skin appearance. In 1995, it was FDA-approved for the treatment of fine wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, and texture changes from sun damage."
