        "Scabies is caused by an allergic reaction to mites living on your skin. It’s also highly contagious. Eczema, on the other hand, is a skin inflammation that gives your skin a rash -like appearance.",
        "Scabies. The itchy rash is caused by an infestation of tiny, burrowing, eight-legged microscopic mites called Sarcoptes scabiei . The itching becomes more intense at night at sites where the mites burrow. It spreads from skin-to-skin contact and is more commonly found in places like child care centers, prisons, nursing homes, and classrooms.",
        "The female mite burrows under your skin and lays eggs. When the eggs hatch, the baby mites (called larvae) make their way to the surface of your skin and spread to different parts. Someone with scabies may have 10-15 mites on them. The itching is usually caused by an allergic reaction to the mites, eggs, and their waste. They can be found on furniture, clothing, and bedding.",
        "Eczema. This rash-like condition may start in childhood, adolescence, or in adulthood. The red, inflamed patches range from mild to severe. While experts don’t know the exact cause, they suspect that eczema is triggered by genetic or environmental factors. However, if you have eczema, it’s not contagious."
