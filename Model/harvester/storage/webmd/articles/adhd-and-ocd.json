About one in four children with ADHD may not need any treatment as adults. This is because stimulant medications used for ADHD can help your child’s frontal lobe develop and mature over time.",
        "By contrast, if your child is diagnosed with OCD, research shows that for around 40%, symptoms go away as they reach adulthood. Therapy and medications can help manage their obsessions and compulsions. But if your child has other conditions along with OCD, it might make it harder to bring their symptoms under control."
