        "If you’ve recently been diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer, you’re not alone. About 1 in 8 women will have breast cancer at some point in their lives. HR+ breast cancer is the most common type.",
        "Because cancer is more likely with age, about 3 in 4 breast cancer cases happen after menopause. Menopause is a natural part of aging in which you don’t get periods anymore. If you go a year without a period, you could be diagnosed with menopause.",
        "But you also could have breast cancer well before menopause. About 1 in 10 breast cancer cases in the U.S. happen before age 45. Premenopausal breast cancer is more common now than in the past. More women are getting breast cancer at younger ages for reasons that aren’t entirely clear.",
        "The transition into menopause, or perimenopause , usually starts when you’re in your mid-40s or 50s. But it can start as early as your 30s if estrogen levels in your body start to swing up and down. Perimenopause usually lasts about four years, but it can go on even longer. Since there’s no simple test, you may be in perimenopause without even knowing it. While you won’t always know and can’t assume your menopausal status simply based on your age, it may affect your cancer journey in various ways."
