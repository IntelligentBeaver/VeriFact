        "Trypophobia is a fear of or aversionxxto tightly packed patterns of holes or other similar patterns, such as those found in honeycombs, sea sponges, or soap bubbles. If you have trypophobia, these sights might make you feel panicky, shaky, and sick.",
        "The name for this problem comes from the Greek words “trypa,” which means hole, and “phobos,” which means fear. But the term doesn't date back to ancient Greece. The term “Trypophobia” reportedly first appeared on a web forum in 2005.",
        "Scientists still don't know much about trypophobia, and it's not yet recognized as a mental disorder.",

        "It's difficult to know for sure how common trypophobia is. In one study, researchers found that 18% of adults had some degree of trypophobia. Some studies show that even some young children are disturbed by images of clustered patterns.",
        "Like other phobias and anxiety disorders , studies show the odds of trypophobia may be slightly higher in females compared to males. However, more research is needed to know exactly how this phobia affects different genders or groups of people.",
