        "Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is a disease that affects many parts of your body. It’s passed down through families and usually starts to cause symptoms once you are in adulthood. You may have heard of some other types of amyloidosis , but hATTR is rare, affecting only 50,000 people worldwide, with many of them being in Sweden, Portugal, and Japan. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) with polyneuropathy is a form of hATTR and is even rarer, affecting around 10,000 people around the world. It used to be called familial amyloid polyneuropathy."

        "Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy is a progressive disease; it gets worse over time. Amyloidosis is a buildup of abnormal deposits of a protein called amyloid in the body's organs and tissues. So symptoms vary depending on what part of the body has those deposits. People with the disease usually start to show symptoms around the age of 30, but they could show up as late as age 65."

        "“The most common areas where you find the deposits are the nerves and the heart,” says Rami Massie, MD, a neurologist at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital. “But other places that can be affected are the meninges of the brain, the eyes, the kidneys, and even some ligaments, among others.” So, if the heart is affected, you might have symptoms of heart failure , which could include: Shortness of breath Fatigue Swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) If it affects your stomach, you could have: Nausea and vomiting Constipation and/or diarrhea Unexpected weight loss Other physical changes could include: Floaters in your vision Carpal tunnel syndrome Spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal column) Erectile dysfunction Excessive sweating Bladder problems Headaches Dementia The one thing that people with hATTR with polyneuropathy have in common, though, is that they have neuropathy, or nerve pain. At first, the nerve pain can be mild. Since nerve pain can be caused by other disorders, it’s difficult to diagnose this disease early. “The early presentation of hATTR with polyneuropathy can be similar to diabetic neuropathy ,” Massie said. “People start having numbness and tingling in their toes , then it spreads to the feet and legs, and eventually may reach the hands. Neuropathic pain in the feet can make it hard to walk or stand for long periods. “You have an increased risk of injuries, ankle weakness, and risk of falling,” Massie said. Pain and numbness in the hands affect how you can do everyday tasks. For example, it can become hard to open containers, write with a pen or pencil, or even type on a keyboard."

        "Living with any type of chronic, progressive disease can have an impact on your emotions. In one study, people with hATTR said they had feelings of fear and anxiety, frustration, and disappointment, as well as depression , anguish, and despair as their disease got worse. They became less able to work, take part in social activities, and even perform basic functions, leading to isolation and even being misunderstood by others. Another emotional issue related to hATTR with polyneuropathy is knowing that this is a hereditary disease, one that you may have unknowingly passed on to your children. Many people living with the disease fear for their children’s future. Or if they don’t have children yet, they wonder whether they should. Some people struggle with telling their children and discussing if they should have genetic testing to see if they have it as well. “If an adult is diagnosed with this disease, their children should have genetic counseling with a genetic counselor,” Massie said. This doesn’t mean they must have genetic testing, though. “Usually, the counselor meets with the children and tells them the advantages and disadvantages of testing. And then it’s up to the child to decide. There are advantages and disadvantages to hATTR genetic testing.”"
