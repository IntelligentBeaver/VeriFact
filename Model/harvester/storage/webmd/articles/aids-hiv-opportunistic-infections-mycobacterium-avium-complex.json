        "Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is a group of bacteria related to tuberculosis . These germs are very common in food, water, and soil. Almost everyone has them in their bodies. When you have a strong immune system, they don't cause problems. But they can make people with weaker immune systems, like those with HIV, very sick.",

        "You can prevent MAC by starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) early and not allow your CD4 count to get low.  If you have a low CD4 count and you get MAC, the infection can be treated, but you may need to take MAC drugs for a long time, until your CD4 count increases in response to ART."
