        "Indoor air quality is important, since Americans spend most of their lives inside. A good filtration system can help protect you and your family from allergens, indoor pollutants like smoke, and viruses like COVID-19. But quality air purifiers, like HEPA machines, can be pricey.",
        "They don’t have to be, though. Richard Corsi, PhD, of the University of California-Davis and Jim Rosenthal, CEO of Tex-Air Filters, have created a type of homemade air filter that costs less than a third of the price of many HEPA devices.",
        "Some early research suggests these DIY air cleaners, made from cardboard, tape, furnace filters, and a box fan, might be more effective in some ways than HEPA purifiers. Experts say they could offer a simple solution to improve air quality in our homes, classrooms, and workplaces, which aren’t always well-ventilated.",
        "“One night, I just scribbled out this idea on a piece of paper,” says Corsi, who is dean of the College of Engineering at the University of California-Davis. “It wasn't an original idea – people had put a single filter on a box fan before. But not with MERV 13 filters.” (MERV, or minimum efficiency reporting values, is a measure of how well a filter captures particles. The higher the MERV, the more effective the filter.)",
        "Once Rosenthal heard about Corsi’s device, he built the first one. Just like that, the Corsi-Rosenthal box was born.",
