If you are homebound by an illness or injury, and your doctor says you need short-term skilled care, Medicare will pay for nurses and therapists to provide services in your home. This is not round-the-clock care. Generally, it's for no more than 28 hours per week. With your doctor's recommendation, you may qualify for more.",

You're eligible if you are not being treated for your terminal illness, and your doctor certifies that you probably will live no longer than six months. You can get care for longer than that, as long as your doctor says you are still terminally ill."

The earlier you buy a policy, the more affordable it's likely to be. The premium becomes more expensive the older you are.
