        "A staph infection is caused by staphylococcus (or \"staph\") bacteria . Actually, about 25% of people normally carry staph in their nose, mouth, genitals, or anal area and don't have symptoms of an infection. The foot is also very prone to picking up bacteria from the floor. The infection often begins with a little cut, which gets infected with bacteria. This can look like honey -yellow crusting on the skin.",
        "These staph infections range from a simple boil to antibiotic-resistant infections to flesh-eating infections. The difference between all these is the strength of the infection, how deep it goes, how fast it spreads, and how treatable it is with antibiotics . The antibiotic-resistant infections are more common in North America because of our overuse of antibiotics.",
