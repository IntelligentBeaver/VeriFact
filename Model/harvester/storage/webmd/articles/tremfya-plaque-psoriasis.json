        "Plaque psoriasis , the most common form of psoriasis, is a type of autoimmune condition where the body’s immune cells attack its own healthy cells. In people with plaque psoriasis, the immune system attacks healthy skin cells, which causes swelling ( inflammation ). This can make too many skin cells form on the skin, causing discolored patches. These patches, which are known as “plaques,” are sections of thick, raised skin that may be covered with a thin silvery-white scale."

        "For most people, the key to treating plaque psoriasis is to avoid triggers, moisturize the skin, and apply topical treatments as prescribed.

The IGA score and the PASI scores are tools for measuring and monitoring psoriasis lesions. Both the IGA and PASI scores look at the thickening and hardening, redness, and scaling of lesions. The PASI score also looks at where lesions are located on the body. The higher the IGA or PASI score, the worse your plaque psoriasis is.",
