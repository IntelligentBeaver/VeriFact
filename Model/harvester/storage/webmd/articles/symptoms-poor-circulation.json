        "Your heart pumps blood rich with nutrients and oxygen throughout the body. This helps keep you healthy and moving well. But circulation can get worse for a number of reasons, including conditions like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and peripheral artery disease (PAD), or weight gain and age. When your circulation isn’t working the way it should, some parts of your body may not get the nutrients they need.",
        "Possible signs of poor circulation include:",
        "Varicose veins . This happens when veins bulge with blood because valves aren’t working right. The result is spidery lines of purplish-blue on your skin , most often in the legs. Too much sitting or standing can worsen the problem. It’s usually not serious, but symptoms can include pain , leg heaviness, aching, swelling, skin dryness, tightness, itching , irritation, and muscle cramps . Wearing compression stockings can help, but your doctor can recommend other treatment options if you don’t like the way your veins look.",
        "Muscle cramps . Often in the legs, these cramps get worse when you walk because your body can’t supply enough oxygenated blood. You typically feel it in your calf , but maybe also in your thigh or butt. The poor circulation could be because of “claudication,” where your arteries narrow due to buildup of plaque along their walls. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat this serious condition."

Medications called diuretics , or water pills, can help get rid of it, if it doesn’t get better on its own. Work with your doctor to diagnose and manage the underlying cause, like kidney , liver , and lung diseases , which are serious and need treatment."
