        "Rates of depression are on the rise, especially among teens and young adults. Almost 1 in 10 Americans over age 12 has had at least one episode of major depression in the last year. Not everyone who struggles with depression gets the help they need. One reason is that help is hard to find. Many parts of the United States face a severe shortage of psychiatrists, especially lower income and minority communities. And about one-third of people who do get treatment aren't able to get relief from their symptoms. But not all depression trends are negative. New findings in the research world should give hope to anyone who has tried current treatments without success. Researchers have made great progress in understanding the genetics and biology of depression. \"Together, this work for the first time is putting depression research on an equal scientific footing with other medical disorders,\" says John Krystal, MD, who is the Robert L. McNeil, Jr. Professor of Translational Research at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, CT."
