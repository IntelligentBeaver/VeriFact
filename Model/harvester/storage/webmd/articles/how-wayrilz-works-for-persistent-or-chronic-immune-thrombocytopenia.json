        "Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare blood disorder in which the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys platelets . Platelets are small blood cells that play a critical role in helping your blood clot. Without enough platelets, people with ITP may bruise easily, bleed for long periods after an injury, or have frequent nosebleeds or gum bleeding. In severe cases, bleeding may occur in organs like the brain, stomach, or spine.",
