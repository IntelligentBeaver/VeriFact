Do not take any NSAIDs during the third trimester of pregnancy. Do not take aspirin at any point during pregnancy. Do not take NSAIDs if you are taking certain cancer drugs that could cause bleeding or if you are taking blood thinners, steroids, or high blood pressure medicine. Taking one low-dose aspirin a day can lower the risk of having a heart attack or stroke. However, talk to your doctor before you start taking it on a regular basis. Daily use of aspirin can have serious side effects, such as bleeding in the stomach. Aspirin has also been linked to Reye syndrome, a rare but serious condition that causes swelling in the brain and liver. Doctors recommend children and adolescents younger than 18 years who are recovering from chickenpox or flu -like symptoms or any viral diseases never take aspirin."
