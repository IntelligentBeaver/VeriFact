        "Minimize contact with people who have colds and wash your hands often. Airborne droplets from sneezes or coughs are the most common mode of spreading this virus, so facemasks can help prevent infection. Don't share towels, silverware, or beverages. Cold viruses survive for as long as 2 hours on doorknobs, on money, and on other surfaces. Wash your hands frequently and properly.",

        "A vaccine to prevent the colds has been difficult to make, primarily because there are more than 200 different varieties of viruses that can cause colds."
