In 25% of people with IgA nephropathy, the disease continues to make small amounts of protein and blood leak into the urine, but they have a more favorable outcome. Some people aren’t even aware they have it. Some even reach remission. But alongside these varied outcomes, there are other challenges to consider."

        "Because IgA affects how well your kidneys can filter your blood, it can cause problems such as: High blood pressure. IgA builds up in your kidneys, and that buildup causes damage over time that can raise your blood pressure. Increased blood pressure also harms your kidneys, speeding up the damage to your filtering system. High blood pressure also puts a strain on your heart and the rest of the circulation, increasing your risk of heart disease. High cholesterol . Kidney disease and cholesterol are linked. When your cholesterol goes up, so does your risk of heart attack and stroke. Nephrotic syndrome . This set of problems happens when IgA buildup damages your glomeruli, which are the small units that filter your blood. It causes high urine protein levels, low blood protein levels, high cholesterol, and swelling of your eyelids, feet, and abdomen."

One study found that after 10 years, IgA nephropathy came back in 19% of those who had a kidney transplant. About 4 out of 10 (40%) transplanted kidneys in people with IgA nephrology eventually fail. Another hurdle is the lack of kidneys available in the U.S. for transplant. A significant number of people with end-stage renal disease linked to IgA nephropathy are waiting for a kidney transplant, but only about 20,000 are performed each year."
