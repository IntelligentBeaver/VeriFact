        "Making changes to your diet can help you control hyperkalemia. Your doctor may recommend a low-potassium diet, especially if you get too much potassium from what you normally eat. They may tell you to limit certain fruits and vegetables , milk and yogurt , nuts and seeds, and other foods like bran, chocolate, granola , and peanut butter . But you may need high-potassium foods to help you stay healthy. Foods like meat, fish, and chicken, which have a lot of potassium, are also high in protein, which is an important part of your diet. “High-potassium foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes contain nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber, which have many health benefits,” says Edith Yang, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Monrovia, CA, who specializes in chronic kidney disease . Having too little potassium isn’t good either. If your potassium is too low, it may lead to problems like abnormal heart rhythm, muscle weakness, and paralysis. “Find the right balance by making sure to include an adequate amount of vegetables on your plate, aiming to eat a rainbow, keeping track of your labs, and working closely with a registered dietitian that specializes in chronic kidney disease,” Yang says."

        "Try these strategies: “Make half of your plate veggies, one-fourth protein, and one-fourth carbohydrate,” Yang says. These numbers may need to be adjusted based on how serious your hyperkalemia is, but it’s a good starting point. Eat a variety of foods. “A wide variety of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables helps ensure you’re getting adequate nutrition,” Yang says. Control your portion size . By limiting your portions, you can get the potassium you need without going overboard. Eat in moderation and watch your serving size. Drain or leach certain foods. If you eat canned fruits, vegetables, or meats, drain them first. If you eat high-potassium fresh vegetables, try leaching them first. Peel and place them in cold water. Next, slice them into thin pieces and rinse them in warm water. Then soak them in warm water for 2 or more hours, rinse them again in warm water, and cook them with extra water. Avoid certain herbal supplements. “Be careful of any supplements that may have potassium added,” Yang says. Let your doctor know if you start taking a new supplement or medication. Avoid salt substitutes, which are high in potassium. Your doctor or dietitian can help create a meal plan and adjust it based on how it works for you."

        "You may need medication to help lower your potassium levels. There are different types of medications. Some lower your potassium quickly, while others do it over time. Common treatments for hyperkalemia include: Diuretics. When you take diuretics, your kidneys make more urine, which removes potassium. As you urinate more, your body gets rid of more potassium. Diuretics are also known as water pills. Potassium binders. This medication binds to extra potassium in your bowels, then removes it when you empty your bowels. A potassium binder may be a powder you mix with water and drink with a meal, or an enema , which goes into your rectum. Changes to your current medications. Certain drugs, like blood pressure medications and immunosuppressants, may lead to high potassium. Your doctor may recommend stopping or changing your medication to lower your potassium levels. If your potassium level is very high and these don’t help, your doctor may recommend other treatments. “Patients with severe hyperkalemia or who aren’t urinating are more likely to need IV therapies or dialysis ,” says Shah. If you have kidney failure, you’ll likely need dialysis."
