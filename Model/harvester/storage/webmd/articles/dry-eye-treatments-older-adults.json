        "A few prescription medications treat moderate to severe dry eye. Eye drops Many different types of eye drops treat dry eye. They work in different ways: Cyclosporine A (Cequa, Restasis, Vevye) works on your immune system to reduce inflammation in your eyes and help them produce more tears. You put one drop in each eye twice a day. These medicines can take three months or more to start working. They also can cause some burning or stinging in your eyes. This side effect should go away the longer you use them. Lifitegrast (Xiidra) also brings down inflammation, but in a slightly different way. You take it twice a day. Xiidra may take up to three months to start working. Side effects include eye irritation and a strange taste in your mouth. Perfluorohexyloctane ophthalmic solution (Meibo) treats dry eye specifically by targeting tear evaporation caused by meibomian gland dysfunction. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension (Eysuvis) is the first corticosteroid eye drop for treating dry eye. It reduces inflammation in your eye faster than other medicines, but you can only use it for two weeks at a time because of risks like cataracts , glaucoma , and infection. Autologous blood serum drops are made from your own blood mixed with a salt solution. These drops contain nutrients and growth factors that protect and nourish your eyes. They may be an option if your dry eye hasn't improved with other drops."

        "The key to relieving dry eye could be to manage the condition that caused it. Control your blood sugar. Consistently high blood sugar from diabetes damages nerves all over your body. It also affects your lacrimal glands, which add fluid to your tears. If you have diabetes, follow your doctor's advice to lower your blood sugar with diet, exercise, and medicine if you need it. Take breaks from your contacts. Contact lenses cause friction as they rub against your eyes. That constant rubbing can leave your eyes irritated and dry. Take breaks from your lenses and wear glasses for a few days or weeks to give your eyes time to recover. Reduce screen time. Dry eye is a symptom of computer vision syndrome, a common eye problem in people who spend a lot of time on their computer, tablet, or cell phone. Normally, you blink about 15 times a minute. But when you're staring at a screen, you only blink five to seven times a minute. Blinking replenishes your tear film. The less you blink, the more quickly your tears evaporate."
