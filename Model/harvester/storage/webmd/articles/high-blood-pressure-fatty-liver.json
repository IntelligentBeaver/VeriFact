        "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is associated with high blood pressure, or hypertension, but the cause-effect relationship between the two conditions is unclear. This condition used to be known as non-alcoholic steatotic liver disease (NAFLD). Steatosis means a buildup of fat in an organ — in this case, the liver. Does too much fat in your liver cause high blood pressure? Or does high blood pressure cause fatty liver disease? More research is needed to answer those questions for sure. But numerous studies have confirmed that the association goes both ways — the two conditions contribute to each other. If you have high blood pressure, you’re more likely to have MASLD, and if you have MASLD, you’re more likely to have high blood pressure. It’s unclear what exactly links MASLD to high blood pressure. But research suggests that the link may be: Systemic inflammation. MASLD can cause inflammation, which can over-activate your body’s sympathetic nervous system and lead to high blood pressure. Insulin resistance, which is when your body doesn’t respond the way it should to the hormone insulin. Fatty liver disease and high blood pressure often coexist, and both are linked to insulin resistance. Oxidative stress, which is when there’s an imbalance between free radicals (unstable molecules that can damage cells) and antioxidants (which counteract the free radicals) in your body. Fatty liver can increase oxidative stress throughout the body, and that can contribute to hypertension. Vasoconstriction is when your blood vessels constrict or tighten. Fatty liver can throw off the hormones that help regulate blood vessel constriction. This can then  raise your blood pressure because the constricted blood vessels require more pressure for blood to travel through them."
