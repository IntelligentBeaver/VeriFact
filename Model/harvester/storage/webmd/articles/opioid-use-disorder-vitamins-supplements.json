There are concerns that kratom is addictive. Some people who use it have withdrawal symptoms when they stop. Kratom also has side effects, and a small number of deaths are linked to its use. But research is underway to see if kratom or some of the compounds within it might be used in the future to treat opioid use disorders. While it’s legal to buy kratom, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration lists it as a “drug of concern.”"
