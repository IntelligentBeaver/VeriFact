        "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Aggressive, when it comes to cancer , means that it grows and spreads fast. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system moves lymph fluid through the body similarly to the way the circulatory system moves blood through the body. The system includes your lymph nodes , lymph vessels, tonsils, spleen, and thymus. It's a key part of your immune system, too. B-cell lymphoma affects B-lymphocytes. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell. B-cell lymphocytes fight infections by making antibodies, or proteins, that recognize and fend off viruses and other invading germs."

But DLBCL can also start in areas outside your lymph nodes, such as your intestines, bones, brain, or spinal cord. Even though it's described as aggressive, it's considered highly treatable.

One of the first signs that your cancer has come back or progressed may be that you are having new symptoms or some of the same ones that led to your diagnosis in the first place. You may have: A quickly growing mass in your neck or belly Painless swelling in your neck, armpit, or groin Fever Fatigue Heavy night sweats Unintended weight loss If DLBCL is in the GI tract, you could have: Pain or a feeling of fullness in your belly Nausea Vomiting Loss of appetite Unintended weight loss If DLBCL is in your central nervous system, including your brain, spinal cord, and eyes, you may have: Headaches Confusion Changes in your vision Trouble speaking or thinking clearly Changes in behavior Seizures",
