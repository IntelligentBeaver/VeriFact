        "I was lying on the couch reminiscing on the things I could remember about my little sister. It was her birthday, and every year, I look at her pictures and think back on her short time here on Earth. She was less than a year old when she passed, and I was 4 years old. Fast forward to year 32, and suddenly I correlated the first time my parents saw signs of psoriasis was when I was 4 years old as well. I instantly ran and grabbed the book that was sitting on my shelf that I keep putting off reading titled The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk, MD. I just started it, but I’m curious to learn the research done on how our bodies hold and react to trauma. However, just reflecting on my own life, I find it to be very true that every traumatic event in my life has led to a reaction within my body."

        "The first psoriasis spot was on my neck. Eventually, it would spread from head to toe over the years. After years of doctor visits and no family history, it just hit me that most likely this was a trauma response. Imagine the changes within the family and the confusion for a big sister at such a young age. Once I thought about how significantly life changes after a magnificent loss, I thought about other flares.",
        "Grief and the trauma of losing loved ones have been some of my worst flares. After losing my grandfather, my skin reacted instantly. I didn’t realize that was the cause at first, so I started being on a strict diet thinking that was the reason. Years later, I lost my dad due the complications of the virus during the pandemic. After that, the psoriasis was out of control for a year straight. Nothing I typically did to get relief worked.",
        "Psoriasis symptoms can be aggravated by many factors such as alcohol, stress, environmental stress, illness, medications, diet, drugs, impaired liver function, yeast overgrowth (Candida), or trauma to the skin as mentioned above with my experience. Think back to the first time you noticed the appearance of psoriasis. Was it during a traumatic time in your life? Were you stressed? Were there any big changes during that time?"
