        "Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an uncommon disorder where your heart takes longer than usual to recover after each beat. It affects one in 5,000 people and can raise the risk of “torsades de pointes,” a type of irregular heartbeat that can be deadly. But there are treatments for it. Here’s what you need to know about the condition and how to manage it.",
        "At its most basic level, long QT syndrome is an electrical problem. The heart is powered by the flow of electrically charged particles -- sodium, calcium, potassium , and chloride -- in and out of the cells through tiny channels, or tubes. With LQTS, there’s a glitch that slows down the heart’s ability to recharge. Its name comes from the way this slower rhythm looks on an electrocardiogram ( EKG ), a test that measures the heart’s electrical activity."
