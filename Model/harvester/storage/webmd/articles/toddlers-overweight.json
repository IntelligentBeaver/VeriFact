        "The truth is that toddlers can be overweight , and it’s not always easy for parents to tell if they are. So it’s important to check in with your child’s pediatrician to see if they are on track size-wise. If you get a handle on their weight at this age, you can even put an early stop to future health problems, such as obesity and diabetes.",

People of all ages can calculate their BMI, but it can be an especially accurate measurement for toddlers, who don’t have a lot of muscle mass that affects their weight, says Kristi King, RD, senior clinical dietitian at Texas Children’s Hospital."
