        "Water’s allure is a double-edged sword. According to the CDC, more than 4,000 people die from unintentional drowning in the U.S. every year, an average of 11 people per day. The problem is especially serious in children between the ages of 1 and 4, in whom drowning is the single leading cause of death. In this group alone, unintentional drowning deaths increased 28% from 2019 to 2022. Native Americans and Indigenous Alaskans, people ages 65 and older, and Black and Hispanic people also saw significant increases in drowning deaths.",

Pool covers, locked entry, and alarms are also recommended. “People don’t understand that 70% of toddler drownings happen during non-swim time,” said Katchmarchi. “I’ve been present in cases where children have managed to open the doors of homes and then have been victims of horrible drowning events,” Levine said.",
        "Provide close, constant, and attentive supervision , even if the swimmers are adults. “It’s the responsibility of every parent to have credible vigilance in watching their children around any water source, regardless of the child’s age, swimming proficiency, or if they’re on a lake or in your home pool,” said Levine.",
        "Learn water competency and water safety skills. Swimming competency means being able to enter the water fully submerged and surface, float, or tread water for 1 minute, swim 25 feet, and exit the water without a ladder. Formal swimming lessons can reduce the risk of drowning in young children by 88%, according to the National Drowning Prevention Alliance. And the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children begin swimming lessons as early age 1, when they are developmentally ready. Adults are encouraged to take first-time swimming lessons (check your local YMCA, YWCA, or county pools) or refresher courses. Many organizations also offer scholarships that cover the cost of lessons.",
