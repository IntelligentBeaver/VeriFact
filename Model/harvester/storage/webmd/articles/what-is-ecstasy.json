        "Ecstasy — also known as Molly, Adam, and XTC, among many other names — is a synthetic drug, meaning it is made from lab-made chemicals. It increases levels of energy, happiness, and empathetic feelings toward others but also causes negative effects, from muscle cramps to depression to heart failure. Even small doses of ecstasy can harm your mental, physical, or emotional well-being. In high doses, it can cause death.",
        "It was first made by German scientists in 1912, but it became widely available on the streets in the 1970s. It's used to increase alertness and experience longer periods of happiness. It may also enhance emotional and sexual relationships.",
        "While not addictive like heroin or cocaine, ecstasy use may lead to dependence. It’s similar to other stimulant drugs, such as methamphetamine. It also causes hallucinogenic effects that can change how you see the world, such as not knowing what time it is or seeing things that are not there. Ecstasy directly affects the levels of neurotransmitters in your brain, including serotonin, dopamine , and norepinephrine ."
