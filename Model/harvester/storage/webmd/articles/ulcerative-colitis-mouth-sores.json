        "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). UC is a chronic (lasting and persistent) condition that mainly affects the colon, part of the large intestine. If you have UC, you get ulcers in your colon, but you can also get sores in your mouth.",
        "It’s not fully understood if ulcerative colitis causes mouth sores, according to Elisa Boden, MD, a spokesperson for the American Gastroenterological Association and an associate professor of medicine at Oregon Health & Science University. They could be a sign of ulcerative colitis affecting the entrance to the intestinal tract. They may also signal inflammation in a separate body system.",
        "Doctors don’t know exactly what causes UC, but it’s connected to inflammation. Inflammation is how the immune system responds to irritants like germs or injuries. It can cause pain, redness, and swelling. The inflamed area may not work as well as usual or at all.",
        "With UC, genes and things in your environment may trigger an immune system response, creating inflammation and sores. \"Inflammation drives a significant amount of these [sores],\" says Kian Keyashian, MD, a clinical associate professor of medicine, gastroenterology, and hepatology at Stanford University in Stanford, California.",
        "Mouth sores are more likely to happen when your UC flares up. If you don’t get enough of certain nutrients, you can also get mouth sores. Some prescription ulcerative colitis medicines can cause them too."
