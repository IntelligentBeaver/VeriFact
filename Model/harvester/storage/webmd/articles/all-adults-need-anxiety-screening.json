        "June 21, 2023 – An influential task force has recommended that all adults under the age of 65 be screened for anxiety. The recommendation comes a year after the same group called for regular anxiety screening for children ages 8 and older.",
        "In their recommendation published Tuesday, members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force wrote that “routine screening could substantially increase the likelihood that patients receive treatment in a timely manner, potentially saving years of distress and reducing economic burden.”",
        "The task force was founded in 1984 and consists of a group of volunteers who work in the fields of preventive medicine and primary care, including internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics, behavioral health, obstetrics and gynecology, and nursing. The panel’s recommendations are not enforceable but are known to influence coverage decisions made by insurance companies.",
        "The task force’s recommendation summary said that at least 1 in 10 adults had mild anxiety in the past 2 weeks, according to a 2019 survey, and more than 1 in 20 had moderate or severe anxiety in the previous 2 weeks."
