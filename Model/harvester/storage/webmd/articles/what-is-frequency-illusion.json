This is known as frequency illusion. Frequency illusion is related to memory. Now that you know about something, it appears to pop up more often.",

        "This phenomenon is very common. It likely affects everyone at some point in their life. Simply put, frequency illusion happens because you pay more attention to things that have recently become important to you.",
        "There are two parts to the frequency illusion. First, you’ll believe that something has begun to show up more often. Then, you’ll convince yourself that the word, concept, or other thing didn’t show up as much as it does now, called confirmation bias . The frequency hasn’t actually gone up, but your brain has convinced you that it has.",
        "While there aren’t many studies on frequency illusion, the concept is very similar to something called “working memory-driven attentional capture.” This explains how your attention is guided. When you hold a certain idea in your mind, your attention naturally goes toward that thing - without you even noticing.",
        "Frequency illusion works with your voluntary and involuntary attention. Voluntary attention helps you select and focus on information that’s important to your current task. Involuntary attention happens when something else captures your attention away from that task.",
        "This is related to how we’ve evolved. Our minds must respond to things around us in order to be safe. But we also need to tune certain things out if we want to effectively complete a task. Attention is important for learning and memory. If you don’t pay attention to something, you won’t remember it. So if you just learned about something new for the first time, chances are that you’ll begin to see it more simply because you’re now aware of it."
