        "One of the challenges for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) is limitations with their working memory, or their ability to hold on to information long enough to use it. Working memory also impacts long-term memory, or how our brain stores information for the future. Weak working memory can make it harder for your child to pay attention, focus, remember and follow instructions, learn, and more.",
        "Many young kids have trouble with working memory. But children with ADHD may also have problems in other cognitive, or thinking, areas including executive function , which helps us plan, prioritize, and do tasks. Those deficits, combined with difficulties with working memory, can present challenges.",
        "Over the past few years, many new apps, websites, and computer games have been created to help children with ADHD improve their brain function, including their working memory. While some research shows they can help, researchers and doctors say there is inconclusive evidence on whether these computerized programs help children when it comes to using and improving their working memory in everyday life."
