Many people with CML take targeted therapy medications daily, which can keep the disease at bay for many years. Here are some things to consider as you start treatment and adjust to life with CML."

When you can, add to a savings account for emergencies. Both income and expenses can change, so be sure to monitor your budget regularly. If you are taking daily medications, consider shopping around for the best price, and talk to your doctor if the cost of treatment for your illness is making it difficult to cover your bills. They can help you find a more affordable treatment option, lower-cost medicines or pharmacies, and connect you to financial assistance programs. You can also look online for assistance programs for people living with CML through organizations such as the National CML Society, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, and the American Cancer Society.",
