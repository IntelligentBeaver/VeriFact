        "New daily persistent headache, or NDPH, is a headache that begins suddenly, doesn’t seem to have any specific cause, doesn’t go away with typical headache treatments, and lasts more than three months.",
        "“It’s an actual diagnosis recognized by the International Headache Society,” says Joey R. Gee, DO, a neurologist at Mission Heritage Medical Group in Mission Viejo, CA. “I don’t think a lot of people understand it. It can last three months and longer, and when you ask [about] the person’s symptoms, they can often pinpoint exactly the day the headache started.”",
        "NDPH causes pain that may get stronger or weaker on any given day, but it’s always there.",
        "New daily persistent headache doesn’t ever go away for many people. Only about 15% of adults with the condition get rid of it completely, and for about 8%, it comes and goes. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images)"
