But if you have too much for too long, it can have serious and severe impacts on your wellbeing. In manageable amounts, however, stress can even be helpful, such as motivating you to get things done.",
        "During stressful times, you may feel down or anxious, and that can be normal for a while.

        "An important first step in stress management is to recognize the sources of your stress and the feelings that they bring up for you, says Rachel Radin, PhD, a clinical psychologist at the University of California, San Francisco. Remember that the things in life that cause you stress may differ from other people and that's OK. Stressors can include anything in life that causes you to worry, tense up, or feel mentally anguished or conflicted.",
