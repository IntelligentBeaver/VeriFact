        "Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune disorder that mainly affects older adults. The condition causes your immune system to attack proteins that hold the layers of your skin together. This damages the barrier between the layers of your skin. Symptoms of BP include an itchy rash with large, fluid-filled skin blisters all over your body. The itchiness can be intense, and the blisters may become painful or break open, increasing the risk of infection. The symptoms can lead to poor sleep and emotional distress.",
        "Until recently, there were no specific medicines to treat BP. For years, the main treatments have involved steroid creams or pills and other medicines to help ease symptoms. But these medicines tend to cause bad side effects if used long term, especially in older adults.",
        "Scientists do not know the exact cause of BP. Recently, researchers discovered that BP may be driven by a type of inflammatory response similar to the inflammation seen in other conditions like eczema."

        "More specifically, Dupixent is thought to work for bullous pemphigoid (BP) by blocking two proteins in the body called IL-4 and IL-13. These proteins are involved in a type of inflammation known as type 2 inflammation, and they seem to play a major role in causing symptoms of BP including itchy, painful blisters and skin damage. People with BP may have high levels of IL-4, IL-13, and other markers of this type of inflammation in their skin and blood. By calming this type of inflammation, Dupixent may stop or reduce symptoms of BP.",
        "While the exact way it works is not fully understood, studies show that Dupixent may help people with BP reach what is called sustained remission. This means no new blisters are forming, old ones are healing, and itchiness is going away."
