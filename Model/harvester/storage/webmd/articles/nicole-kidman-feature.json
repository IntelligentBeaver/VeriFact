        "Nicole Kidman is the first to admit that she's not likely to replace Padma Lakshmi on Bravo's Top Chef any time soon. Some celebrities like to tout their prowess in the kitchen, but Kidman, the Academy Award-winning star of films like Days of Thunder , Cold Mountain , The Hours , and The Golden Compass , isn't one of them.",
        "\"I'm a very basic cook, and it's so not my skill. I'm more than happy to order out or have somebody else cook,\" says Kidman, whose latest film, a biography of Princess Grace of Monaco, opens the Cannes Film Festival on May 14. And although she says she can manage simple salmon and steamed vegetables , Kidman also says that when she and her husband, country star Keith Urban, travel with their daughters Sunday Rose, 6, and Margaret Faith, 3, healthy meals can be a challenge.",
        "\"It's hit-and-miss a lot of times, and that's the God's honest truth. When we're on the tour bus with Keith, we don't eat so healthily. We'll eat chicken burgers and so on, which we feel is healthier,\" she says, laughing. \"But Keith will go and get a big hamburger or hot dog. But then we do try to get more salads and proteins.\"",
        "Anyone who has envied Kidman's willowy 5-foot-11-inch figure might feel slightly pleased to learn staying trim is not quite so effortless for her these days. \"When I was a teenager, I could eat like a horse and people were shocked. If I'd been shorter I would have had to learn good habits sooner,\" she says. \"But I hit my 40s and I became far more prone to putting on weight , and I had to change the way I've always eaten. No more huge slabs of chocolate cake!\""
