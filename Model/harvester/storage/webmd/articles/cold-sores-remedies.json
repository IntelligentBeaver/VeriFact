        "A cold sore is a group of small, painful blisters (ulcers) on your face caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Although they typically show up around the outside of your mouth, you can also get cold sores on your nose or cheeks. There are two types of HSV: type 1 is called oral herpes or HSV-1, and type 2 is called genital herpes or HSV-2. Cold sores can happen because of an oral herpes infection. It mainly spreads by mouth-to-mouth contact. But some people with this type of infection don't get any symptoms at all. Because HSV-2 can easily spread (be very contagious), it is also very common. Once you're infected, it sticks with you for the rest of your life. Although there isn't a cure, there are ways that you can lower your risk of cold sores and make symptoms happen less often."

They can prescribe an antiviral medication such as: Acyclovir (Zovirax ) Famciclovir Penciclovir (Denavir ) Valacyclovir (Valtrex ) You can take these treatments orally as a pill or put a cream on your skin. Generally, the pills do a better job of clearing up cold sores than the creams. If your infection is serious, your doctor may suggest getting an antiviral medication through an injection. Lip balm Lip balm might be the first cold sore remedy that comes to mind. These over-the-counter balms can help: Soothe your cold sore Provide moisture to your lips and mouth Keep your cold sore from drying out and cracking Because you can pass on your infection, don't share your lip balm with anyone. Throw it out and buy a new one once your cold sore clears up."

        "If your child has a cold sore, it’s important to prevent spreading it to their siblings, schoolmates, or other family members. Here are some ways to stop the spread of cold sores: Scratching or picking at a cold sore can spread the virus to other parts of the body. Tell your child not to touch the cold sore and to wash their hands and toys regularly. Don’t let your child share anything that they put near their mouth (toys, toothbrushes, utensils, soothers, etc.) during a cold sore flare-up. Don’t allow your child to take part in sports or social activities in which they would be in close contact with other children. To help prevent cold sores from coming back, you can: Prevent irritated skin and avoid triggers that can result in a cold sore. Make sure your child uses lotion and lip balm that contains sunscreen. Help your child get enough sleep and exercise, and make sure they eat a well-balanced diet. Avoid acidic foods during an outbreak. Find ways to help your child manage their stress levels and stay calm."
