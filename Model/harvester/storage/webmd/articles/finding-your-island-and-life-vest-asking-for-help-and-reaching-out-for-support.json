        "In the beginning, when my diagnosis was fresh and new, I did a lot of my own research online. I asked for information to be sent to my home so that I had it on hand to circle back in case I forgot something or wanted to double-check my memory. Because an original diagnosis is not always set in stone and things can change along the way, I didn’t want to get myself too overly focused on terms, medications, side effects, and symptoms.",
        "This was the right thing to do because my diagnosis changed several times. My symptoms continued to change, and I had added symptoms over time. My medications changed many times, and so my side effects from all the new medications kept changing. What I needed along the way for sure was the help of others. Everything is so overwhelming! I can’t imagine facing this all by myself.",
        "My husband is my island. When I find myself in the middle of the ocean drowning with information or in over my head, he is that island that appears in the sunset, and I can swim up to it due to its close location. I have a doctor, a rheumatologist, who is my life vest. He is an intelligent doctor, and a wonderful listener. He holds me up in the water so that I can survive as I swim to the island. My counselor is my boat. She gives me a ride aboard when I simply can't swim all the way to the island, even with the help of a life vest. And then there are all the dolphins that surround me to cheer me up and entertain me – those are my very dear friends. They are always around me even when I don’t see them. I just call them, and they come to the surface.",
        "Everyone needs help at some point in time. Having psoriatic arthritis causes me to have issues with pain in my joints, mainly my hands, wrists, elbows, ankles, feet, knees, and my back. I have problems with my eyes and my skin. I often need help with small things like opening jars and packages, and I also sometimes need help with larger things like cleaning the house. And then there are even bigger things that I may need to ask for some help with, like grocery shopping. It can be extremely hard to ask for help because to someone like me, it is like I am admitting that I am weak, in pain, or incapable of something. I don’t like to admit that I can’t do something. I don’t like to ask people for their help. I always will try to do something on my own first."

        "I was blessed to have such a fantastic rheumatologist. He is a doctor, a friend, and a resource. He has always been there as my life vest. I am grateful to have found him when I did. I needed a new rheumatologist because the one I had been seeing was not looking out for me. He took me off all my medications and wanted to see with his own eyes that my joints swelled and that my skin broke out in psoriasis when I was not on any medications. That was not a doctor out to help me, so I found my current rheumatologist. He is accurately a life vest. He saved me in many ways. I began to feel better again when I started to see him as my rheumatologist. I was able to talk to him as a patient, friend, and as an advocate for others who were going through what I was going through. I wanted to offer support to those who needed it, to those who were also living with psoriatic arthritis.",
        "When I met my husband, I didn’t want to scare him away. I had all these physical problems with my psoriatic arthritis. I had psoriasis on visible areas of my skin, and I had arthritis pain in areas that were not visible to others. The pain was intense at times. I sometimes would walk with a cane. My family members had a lot of denial. They didn’t believe I was in any pain. They thought the psoriasis was just allergies to laundry detergent or soap. I could never really speak to my family about having psoriatic arthritis. If I needed help or wanted support, I had to search outside of my family. That can cause a lot of stress when your support system isn’t strong at home. I was very thankful to find a partner that believed in me and supported me. He was always there since we went to the same university and dated all 4 years there. We spent all our time together, and when we weren't together, we were close to one another. That’s when I realized he was my island. He was always nearby, close enough to swim to."

        "I feel like because my family was never really that strong of a support system for me, I never reached out to them for help. I never asked them to take me to doctor appointments. I never told them about surgeries I was having, so they didn’t visit me in the hospital or at home while I recovered from surgery. They never helped with anything if I was recovering and needed someone to help with housework, groceries, cooking, or watching my son or my dogs. Thankfully, I had my friends! I had friends in many places. They would come at once whenever I called them! They were indeed my dolphins! They kept me entertained with food, drinks, and movies at home for a proper recovery. They would have meal trains from our church group of friends. I had friends from foundations and associations for which I had been volunteering. My friends, the dolphins, would jump up in a heartbeat! They would not always be around me. I didn’t always see them around, but if I needed them, they would surface to make sure I was happy and helped.",
        "It is important to have your own set of dolphins, life vests, boats, and islands. You can have one of each or as many as you need or want. They keep you from drowning in your pain, sorrow, symptoms, and side effects from all the medications. They work together or as individuals, but all are needed to help you out and to offer support. We don’t always have dedicated support in every aspect of our lives. For me, my family was not a good support system, but I was lucky to have found a supportive husband. He became my island. I didn’t start out with a strong rheumatologist. Because of that, I found a life vest with my newer rheumatologist. He helped me to feel better, became a friend, and helped me to become an advocate for others like me. And my counselor is special to me. What I don’t feel comfortable sharing with others, I am able to share with her. She helps me to release my stress and express my emotions, as they can be a lot to deal with when you have psoriatic arthritis. She is a leak-proof boat that helps me to stay afloat in the ocean of pain, distress, and fatigue."
