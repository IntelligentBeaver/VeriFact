        "Heartburn in infants and young children is usually a sign of gastroesophageal reflux (also called GER or acid reflux ). That's a condition that occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus -- the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. There is a muscle at the bottom of the esophagus called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) that normally keeps acids in the stomach.",
        "But if the LES relaxes too much, the harsh stomach acids can rise up and irritate the delicate lining of the esophagus. Sometimes, it moves into or out of the mouth. That leads to heartburn and other symptoms.",
        "GERD , a more serious form of GER, affects just over 1% of infants. The baby's spit-up is stronger, often repetitive, and babies may also experience the discomfort of heartburn. This can be seen with fussiness during feeding."
