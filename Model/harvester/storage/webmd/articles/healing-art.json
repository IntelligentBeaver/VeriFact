        "July 9, 2001 -- A bright, accomplished pianist, \"Anne\" was also a diabetic who had suffered the disease's worst blows. First, she lost her sight -- then a leg to amputation . That's when Anne's spirit lost strength. To help her work through a severe bout of depresssion, an art therapist at her hospital introduced Anne to sculpture. As she worked the clay -- shaping it into delicate flowers, leaves, shells -- Anne found release for her emotions, focus for her thoughts. Her depression gradually lifted.",
        "\"Zack\" was always in trouble in school. When it came to impulse control, he acted like a toddler , not a 15-year-old. But learning to draw helped slow Zack's actions. Creating art was almost like meditation. His thoughts gained focus; his impulses grew quieter. Slowly, he learned control.",

But when his art therapist made two small clay animals for him, he had a vent for his emotions. \"The lion is eating the snake's head,\" he told his therapist, acting out his anger."
