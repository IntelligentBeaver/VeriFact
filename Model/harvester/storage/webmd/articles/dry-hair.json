        "Shampoo. Choose a shampoo formulated for your hair type. Many shampoos have detergent-like ingredients called sulfates to remove excess dirt and oil, but these can damage hair. Look for formulas that say “sulfate free” and list dimethicone as an ingredient. It increases shine and manageability.",
        "Moisturize. After every shampoo, use a conditioner designed for dry or damaged hair . Toye suggests also using regular at-home treatments like deep conditioners (also called protein packs). For mildly dry hair, you may need only one treatment a month. If your hair is very dry, use a deep conditioner once or even twice a week. Your stylist can tell you how often to use it.",
        "Comb carefully. Dry, damaged hair is prone to breaking because it's so fragile. “Excessive pulling caused by using the wrong comb or brush is a main cause,\" says Debra Jaliman, MD, a dermatologist and author of Skin Rules: Trade Secrets from a Top New York Dermatologist . Toye suggests using a wide-toothed comb or a brush that's labeled specifically for detangling hair before getting in the shower. It's more difficult to detangle wet hair without pulling, he says.",
        "Dry gently. Go easy on towel drying to prevent your dry hair from breaking. Instead of rubbing vigorously, Toye suggests squeezing out water softly -- as you would with a cashmere sweater.",
        "Spare the heat. Limit heat styling to once a week, and use the lowest setting on blow dryers, flat irons, and curling irons. To buy extra time between heat stylings, Toye suggests using a dry shampoo. After applying styling products like gel or mousse and before using heat, put a thermal-protection spray or serum on your hair. “These act like a buffer that prevents heat damage,\" Toye says."
