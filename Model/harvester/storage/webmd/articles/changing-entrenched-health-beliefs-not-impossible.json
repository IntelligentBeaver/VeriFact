        "These were not people “on the fence” about getting the vaccine.

        "Conlin and colleagues compared 384 unvaccinated adults given either a conversion message or a one-sided story from someone who always intended to get vaccinated. The strongest reduction in hesitancy was among the most vaccine-resistant people given the conversion stories. The full study was published online in December 2023 in the journal Health Communication .",
        "And it's not just about embracing of new kind of thinking, Conlin noted. These messages also help people “realize that their prior beliefs were maybe misinformed or misguided.”"
