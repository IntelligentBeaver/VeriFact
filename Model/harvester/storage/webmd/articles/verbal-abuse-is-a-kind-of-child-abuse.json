        "Oct. 3, 2023 – A team of researchers from the U.S. and London are recommending that verbal abuse be identified as a standalone type of child abuse, rather than grouping it within the label of emotional abuse. The suggestion comes amid recent reports that emotional abuse of children is now more common than physical or sexual abuse.",
        "Researchers from Wingate University in North Carolina and from University College London analyzed data from 166 previous studies of child abuse. Their findings were published this month in the journal Child Abuse & Neglect .",
        "For the study, child abuse was defined as “an adult or other caregiver engaging in acts that harm or omit needed care to a child.” The four currently recognized types of child abuse, the authors wrote, are physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect.",
        "Although some studies used other ways of measuring childhood verbal abuse, one common method is a question on the widely used Adverse Childhood Experiences Quiz that asks, “Before your 18th birthday, did a parent or other adult in the household often or very often swear at you, insult you, put you down, or humiliate you, or act in a way that made you afraid that you might be physically hurt?”"
