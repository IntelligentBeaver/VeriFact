        "Lymphedema occurs whenever something blocks your lymph fluid from draining. It most commonly occurs in the arms or legs but can happen in the chest wall, abdomen, neck, or genitals as well. Lymphedema is a common side effect of surgery.",

The Physical Activity and Lymphedema Trial found that women who were at risk for developing lymphedema after breast cancer were less likely to develop it if they did resistance training. The same trial found that women who had stable lymphedema were less likely to have a flare-up if they did strengthening exercises. ‌",
