        "When 16-year-old \"Whitney\" made the varsity track team, she noticed that her best times were slower than the older girls, who were extremely thin. So Whitney began eating less. Within two months, she had dropped 11 pounds and reduced her body fat to less than 14%. Although her race times and endurance improved, Whitney's menstrual periods stopped.",
        "Then, in her senior year, Whitney was predicted to qualify for the state track team. While running the day before the meet, she tripped on a tiny rock, fracturing her ankle . Though Whitney was lean, muscular, and appeared to be the picture of health, her doctor became concerned about her excessive dieting , low body weight , and loss of her period. These are all key risk factors for low bone density (osteoporosis) and fractures . He immediately ordered a bone density test , which tests the strength of bones. The test results showed that Whitney had low bone density and that she had the bone strength of a much older woman."
