        "As we enter 2024, it’s that time of the year to set your New Year's resolutions! But how do you set realistic goals with chronic illness? How do you balance the ambition you feel on some days, along with the setbacks that fibromyalgia causes?",
        "The reality of living with fibromyalgia is your symptoms will likely interfere with your goals. Setbacks in your health and goals are expected with a life of chronic illness. Recently, I learned of the 1% theory, which seemed like the least overwhelming approach to achieving goals.",
        "If you can just consistently give 1% each day, over a year, you will make significant progress. It made me realize that, when living with chronic illness, this is already the way we live our lives. Some days our spoons run out early and we only have the 1% to give, and some days we have a lot more energy to spare. Slowly but surely, we make ends meet with what we have."

Of course, you take care of your body and manage your chronic illness, but that doesn’t mean you need to restrict your ambition. Small-mindedness is not a symptom of our chronic illness, it’s quite the opposite.",

We learned how to constantly adapt to a world that isn’t built for chronic illness and to find endless opportunities for ourselves. After living with fibromyalgia for over a decade, you learn to constantly redesign a new life with it.",

Some days I lived within my limitations, and sometimes I pushed them. So why not set big goals? We deserve the opportunity to dream big, aim high, and have fun in the process."
