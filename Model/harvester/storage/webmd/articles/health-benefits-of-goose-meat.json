When hot, goose fat exists in a liquid form, but it is semi-solid at room temperature and appears thick and creamy. You can cook other food with it to add flavor. You may want to try goose-fat-roasted potatoes one day. Goose fat has a melting point of between 25°C and 37°C (or 77°F–99°F) and a smoke point of 190°C (or 375°F). When refrigerated, it will stay fresh for up to three months."

It has a cream-to-yellow color. When hot, goose fat exists in a liquid form, but it is semi-solid at room temperature and appears thick and creamy. You can cook other food with it to add flavor. You may want to try goose-fat-roasted potatoes one day. Goose fat has a melting point of between 25°C and 37°C (or 77°F–99°F) and a smoke point of 190°C (or 375°F). When refrigerated, it will stay fresh for up to three months.",
