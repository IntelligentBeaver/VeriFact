        "Cording — also known as axillary web syndrome (AWS) — often happens after your doctor removes lymph nodeds under your arm. A cord or web of cords can form under the skin on the inside of your arm. The cord-like tissue can extend from your shoulder to your elbow, or into your palm.",
        "You can usually feel this cord as you extend your arm away from your body. The rope-like structure can also appear near your ribs or chest wall. You may not always see the cord. But it can still limit your movement and cause pain.",
        "Cording is likely caused by injury to your lymph vessels, blood vessels, or nerves under your arm. In fact, about 86 in 100 people who have breast cancer surgery to remove lymph nodes get cording.",
        "And you're at higher risk for cording if you're younger, have a lower BMI, and get multiple lymph nodes removed. This rope-like tissue can cause discomfort and make using your arm harder. Find out more about how cording happens, the symptoms, and treatments that can help."
