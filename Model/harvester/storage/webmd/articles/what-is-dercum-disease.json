        "Many different drugs have been tried to treat Dercum's disease pain. In general, they have limited effectiveness. But some people report relief from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and narcotics. Others say they've been helped by injections of lidocaine and/or ketamine. While surgery and liposuction are sometimes done for pain relief, the results are often temporary. Some people also try alternative therapies, like acupuncture. A care team that includes pain medicine specialists and psychotherapists can help you deal with pain.",
        "The painful lumps may not go away with weight loss. But aiming for a healthy weight, by gradually increasing physical activity and having a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and grains, and low in sugar (such as the Mediterranean or DASH eating plans) may ease symptoms. Those lifestyle changes, along with medications, if needed, can also lessen your risk of diabetes and other health problems associated with obesity and overweight."
