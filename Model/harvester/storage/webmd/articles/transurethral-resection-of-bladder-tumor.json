        "If you have bladder cancer or suspected bladder cancer, your doctor has probably told you that you need a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, or “TURBT” for short.",
        "A TURBT procedure is used to both diagnose and treat bladder cancer.",
        "A doctor inserts a long, thin, flexible tool called a resectoscope into your urethra. That’s the tube that carries urine from your bladder outside your body. By going in through this natural opening in your body, the doctor doesn’t need to make any cuts in your skin . That’s what makes it a minimally invasive procedure.",

        "The resectoscope has a light, a video camera, and loop on the end that’s used to remove tumors. During the procedure, the doctor uses the scope to see and remove the tumors.",
        "“It serves a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic purpose in that we confirm the type of bladder cancer; we grade the tumor as high grade or low grade, and we stage it,”  says Roger Li, MD, a genitourinary oncologist at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, FL. That is, the doctor can find out what stage cancer you have based on whether and how far the tumor has spread into the bladder wall. “In some cases,” he says, “we can also fully resect [take out] the tumor.”"
