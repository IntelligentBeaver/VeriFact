        "If you’re 65 and eligible for retirement benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board, you most likely won’t pay a monthly premium for Medicare Part A. Part A covers your hospital insurance. You’ll be eligible for this “premium-free Part A” if you’ve worked long enough. That usually means you or your spouse paid Medicare taxes for at least 10 years. If you can’t get Part A at no monthly cost, you can choose to pay for it. Check to see what the premium is now. In 2024, the cost for Medicare Part A was up to $505 per month. If you aren’t sure you’re eligible for Part A without a premium, log into your Social Security account to find out. You can also check your W2s or ask your employer."

        "Most people will pay a monthly premium for Medicare Part B, which covers your outpatient care, such as doctor’s visits. If you’re getting Social Security benefits, the cost for Part B will come out of your payment. If you aren’t getting Social Security, you’ll pay a bill. Most people pay a standard amount. In 2024, the standard monthly premium for part B was $174.70. There is an exception if your yearly income 2 years ago was above a certain amount on your individual or joint tax returns. If it was, you’ll pay a higher monthly amount. Both Part A and Part B have a deductible you’ll need to meet each year. You’ll also pay coinsurance if you’re in the hospital for an extended time. Under Part B, you’ll usually pay 20% of the Medicare-approved cost for your health care services."

          "text": "You may qualify for help in paying for your Medicare premiums and other costs. The programs available and requirements will depend on where you live. If you have a limited income, you may qualify for Medicaid. State rules vary, so contact your local office to find out if you qualify. Depending on income, you may be eligible for a Medicare savings program from your state that helps with monthly premiums. Check to see if you qualify and learn how to apply. Some states offer PACE, which stands for Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly. It’s a program to meet people’s needs in their community instead of a nursing home or care facility. PACE covers many services, including dentist, home and hospital care, prescription drugs, and meals. There are many ways to lower your prescription drug costs, including choosing generics and mail-order pharmacies. If your income and resources are limited, you may also qualify for a program called Extra Help, which assists with Medicare Part D costs. This program can help with premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and late enrollment penalties. If you have Medicare Part A and B, you may want to think about buying Medicare Supplement insurance, or a Medigap plan. These plans help lower your out-of-pocket costs.",
