I bring extra doses of everything just in case a trip gets extended or I have a flare-up and need to increase dosages. I pack full bottles of any “as needed” medication so I have the ability to treat migraines, pain, or any other issues while I’m away.",

I pack my migraine ice pack, muscle rubs, heating pad, and acupressure mat. There’s nothing worse than feeling sick when you’re away from home, so I try to have every resource available to take care of myself while I’m away."
