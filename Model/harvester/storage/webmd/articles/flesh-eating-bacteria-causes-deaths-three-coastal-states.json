        "Aug. 21, 2023 -- Flesh-eating bacteria have killed eight people along the Eastern Seaboard, prompting health officials to urge people to take precautions around warm sea water or when cooking or eating shellfish.",
        "The bacteria, called Vibrio vulnificus , is considered rare but can infect open wounds or infect people after they’ve eaten contaminated shellfish. People at particular risk are those who have unprotected cuts and wounds, those with liver disease or cancer , and people taking medicine to decrease stomach acid levels.",
        "Florida has reported 26 cases and five deaths, New York state has reported one person who died from a wound infection, and Connecticut reported two people with wound infections and one person infected from eating raw, non-local oysters. Two of the people infected in Connecticut have died.",
        "“ Vibrio vulnificus can cause severe infections when open cuts and wounds, including recent surgeries, piercings, and tattooed skin, are exposed to water containing the bacteria,” the Connecticut Department of Health warned in a statement . “Vibrio are being referred to in the media as ‘shellfish bacteria;’ however, these bacteria are naturally occurring in the salt and brackish water. Shellfish can accumulate any contaminants, including bacteria, that are present in the water, which is why they are a highly regulated food commodity.”"
