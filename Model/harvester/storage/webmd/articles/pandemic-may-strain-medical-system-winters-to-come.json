        "People with other serious illnesses may have trouble getting the care they need and will face long emergency room waits before admission, Jha told The Washington Post .",
        "“I am worried that we are going to have, for years, our health system being pretty dysfunctional, not being able to take care of heart attack patients, not being able to take care of cancer patients, not being able to take care of the kid who’s got appendicitis because we’re going to be so overwhelmed with respiratory viruses for … 3 to 4 months a year,” he said.",
        "Before the pandemic, hospitals usually saw more patients in the winter because of the flu and  other respiratory illnesses. But the presence of COVID means that winter crunch is starting months earlier than usual – as soon as August or September, Jha said."
