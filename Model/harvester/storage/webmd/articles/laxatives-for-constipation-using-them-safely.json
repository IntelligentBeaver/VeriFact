This type of laxative works by stimulating the lining of the intestine, thereby accelerating the stool's journey through the colon. Stimulant laxatives also increase a stool's hydration . Some popular brands include bisacodyl ( Correctol , Dulcolax, Feen-a-Mint ), and sennosides ( Ex-Lax , Senokot ). Prunes (dried plums) are also an effective colonic stimulant and taste good, too. Note: Don't use stimulant laxatives daily or regularly. This type of laxative may weaken the body's natural ability to defecate and cause laxative dependency. One more caveat: the stimulant laxatives may cause cramping and diarrhea .",
