        "Multiple sclerosis (MS) can come with a wide range of symptoms. A common symptom that occurs in people with advanced MS is dysphagia: difficulty swallowing . Issues with swallowing occur when muscles in your mouth and throat don’t work together. This also makes it harder for you to chew. MS can damage the nerves that control those muscles, causing weakness and numbness.",
        "Dysphagia affects about one-third of people with MS. This can have severe complications, like aspiration pneumonia , malnutrition, dehydration, and airway obstruction. Other complications include feeling like food is stuck in your throat, throat clearing when eating or drinking, or experiencing a coughing or choking sensation when eating or drinking.",
        "There are methods you can try, though, to help manage issues you’re having with swallowing."
