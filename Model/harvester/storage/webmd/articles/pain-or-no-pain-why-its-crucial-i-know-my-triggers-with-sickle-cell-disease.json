        "Both of my parents are nurses. My mother has been a nurse since I was born, and my father became a nurse shortly thereafter. With both of my parents being in the medical field, they knew that the key to my success was teaching me how to listen to my body and avoid my triggers. My biggest triggers for a sickle cell pain crisis were dehydration, stress, cold and hot temperatures, physical exertion, and water (getting wet/ staying wet).",
        "If my parents taught me nothing else, they taught me to always HYDRATE, HYDRATE, HYDRATE! When I was younger and even as an adult, my parents drilled into my skull to drink water and drink Gatorade. I would drink water when I was thirsty, which was almost always all the time. I would chug Gatorade when I was dehydrated or getting dehydrated. My parents and doctors had recommended that I drink Gatorade because it has electrolytes.",
        "Dietitians say “Electrolytes are essential minerals – like sodium, calcium, and potassium – that are vital to many key functions in the body.” With sickle cell disease, you want your red blood cells to be as round, juicy, and fat as possible so that they can more easily move around the body. If you’re dehydrated, then your veins and capillaries are constricted. This means that it is harder for your sickle-shaped cells to move around your body without clumping in one area or multiple areas, causing a pain crisis."

Unfortunately, in life, you have to go to work or go to school.

There’s something about getting into a pool of cool or cold water that automatically triggers pain for me.
