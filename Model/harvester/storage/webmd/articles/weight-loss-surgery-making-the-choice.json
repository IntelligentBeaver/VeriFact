        "Your surgeon uses an inflatable, silicone band called a Lap-Band to squeeze the stomach into two sections: a smaller upper pouch and a larger lower section. The two sections stay connected by a very small channel, which slows down the emptying of the upper pouch. Most people can only eat a half-cup to 1 cup of food at one meal before feeling too full. The food also needs to be soft or well-chewed.",

You have a smaller scar, faster recovery, and you can have surgery to remove the band if you want to.",
        "How you digest food doesn't change, so you have a lower risk of malnutrition than with other surgeries such as gastric bypass . You can also get the band adjusted in a doctor's office through a port placed at your skin during surgery. To tighten the band and further reduce your stomach size, your doctor injects more saline solution into the band. To loosen it, your doctor uses a needle to remove liquid from the band.",
