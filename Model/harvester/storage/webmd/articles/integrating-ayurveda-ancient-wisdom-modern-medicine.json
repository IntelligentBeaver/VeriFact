        "Welcome to the WebMD Health Discovered podcast. I'm Dr Neha Pathak, WebMD's Chief Physician Editor for Health and Lifestyle Medicine. Today, we're exploring the concepts of an ancient medical practice known as Ayurveda, which literally translates to \"the science of life.\" We all know that health is not just physical or mental alone. More and more, we recognize that both the body and mind weave together how we experience our symptoms. Being healthy is a whole-person exercise, more than just managing one organ system at a time. That's the framework for the ancient practice of Ayurveda — a practice that tackles not just our symptoms, but also the roots of our worries, aches, and underlying conditions. In today's episode, we'll discuss how it pairs modern medical knowledge with age-old wisdom about balancing daily rhythms, emotions, and physical health. Imagine unlocking a more personalized guide for living — one that embraces everything from the spices in our kitchen to the sleep schedule that we maintain on a regular basis, while also examining how stress and past experiences influence our entire healing journey. We'll talk about why so many people, including those with chronic health conditions, are turning to integrative approaches like Ayurveda — which some might argue can be seen in some more modern scientific approaches like lifestyle medicine — rather than relying on prescriptions alone. Whether you're grappling with everyday annoyances like bloating or fatigue, or more serious health concerns like autoimmune issues, you'll hear how aligning your body's natural cues and rhythms can transform your understanding of health and well-being. First, let me introduce my guest, Dr Siva Mohan. With an M.D. and a background in neuroscience and behavioral change, Dr Mohan presents a unique East-West mind-body version of Ayurveda. She guides her audience to an individualized wellness lifestyle with tools and approaches from Ayurveda, psychiatry, and functional medicine. Welcome to the WebMD Health Discovered podcast, Dr Mohan."

        "Pathak: I'm really excited for our conversation today. But before I jump into that, I'm curious about where your journey to Ayurveda — and really sort of practicing it as part of your clinical practice — started.",
        "Mohan: Well, yeah, it's quite a journey that it took. I went into psychiatry because it really spoke to me. I felt like psychiatry was one of the few specialties where we could actually spend more time understanding how people's lives affected their health. And then I went on to do a master's in public health, working in international developing settings where we were really looking at social, cultural, climate, community-based factors that were affecting health parameters and designing solutions for them. So I do feel like I always had this sort of big-picture understanding of being meant to look for root causes of disease and focus there — that I wanted to really attend to those upstream factors before they developed into chronic, degenerative, chronic inflammatory, cancerous processes, for example. And what was really interesting is that as I was on this journey, I developed many of those myself. And so I had a whole list of pretty serious diagnoses in my mid-twenties. And as I was traveling in very remote places, it was the women coming to me with their indigenous healing remedies from nature that were really what was helping my symptoms — whereas allopathic medicine was only offering me immunosuppressants and, you know, a whole array of pharmaceuticals that really I would have to be on for the rest of my life without truly attending to root causes or having the alternatives that had less side effects. Right? So that was very eye-opening for me. And that's what also drew me back to that same cultural heritage that you have — of being raised in a house where my grandmother was always going to the kitchen for a natural remedy for whatever happened — and a passion to study the indigenous healing culture and practices from India. So that then led to studying Ayurveda. And I really had no idea that that would lead to an integrative platform, if you will, down the road. It was really a personal journey that led there, but Ayurveda very much is all about understanding root causes, the bigger picture, how our lives are impacting our health. So, although I just viewed it more reductionistically as a natural remedy source before, I now see that it's a very good fit for what was my original sort of drive in healing."

        "Really, just so beautifully said, and I really appreciate you sharing that story with us. So can you define some of these terms that we're using? Can you give us a brief introduction to what is Ayurveda — the philosophy, the historical roots — before we dig more into the science of it?",
        "Mohan: Sure, absolutely. So Ayurveda is actually credited with being the oldest healing system documented within human culture. And so, anthropologically speaking, they have traced back every different healing system — including Greek Hippocratic medicine, which allopathic medicine is then derived from — to humoral medicine. So I sort of view it as the mother healing science, and there are written records 5,000 to 10,000 years old. It's amazing what they knew about the body, about nature, about the planets, and how all these systems really fit together back then. I think that today, you know, if you Google \"What is Ayurveda?\" it really gets almost put out there as a \"type yourself and live this way,\" \"type yourself and buy this product,\" \"type yourself and eat this food,\" \"type yourself and take these herbs\" — and that could not be further from what I believe is the true essence of Ayurveda, which is more of a living awareness of \"Where am I at, and what do I need to feel well today?\" So this idea of typing yourself is a very constitution-centric idea, but the truth of the matter is, if I'm going to bring in any therapeutic intervention, it's all based on where I am today — not how I was made, right? So if we look at constitution as sort of everyone’s born with their unique shade of color, we don’t really need to treat the shade of color. That’s more just to understand: \"Oh, you’re this shade, you go well with these things, you don’t go so well with these things.\" It’s nice for self-awareness and long-term understanding of our tendencies, our probabilities — almost like the genetic component, if you will. Whereas we have a concept in Ayurveda called \"current state,\" which is more: Where are you at today? What are the patterns happening in all the different parts of you today? And that's the place where we would bring in therapeutic interventions with diet, routine, herbs, mantras, etc. So you can see why this idea of typing yourself is more of a mass-marketing thing that happened — and almost is one of the biggest myths now about what Ayurveda is — whereas it's really a path to self-realization in and of itself. It is about learning what your patterns are and attending to them in kind, with personalized approaches to shift the patterns that you want to shift and to support cultivating patterns that you want to bring in — that support your unique energy ball of a being."

        "So, listening to you, we're talking about different components of what makes you a human being in this world. So we're talking about the physical aspects of your body, your interest in psychiatry, your training in psychiatry. So we've got the mind-brain, body-mind connection. And then there's a spiritual piece of it as well. I'm really curious — do you pull this in to the way that you practice today? With someone coming into your clinic, where do you start with this approach?",
        "Mohan: Oh, that is such a great question because this really has had to evolve over time, you know. And there are a lot of practitioners, even in India now — when Ayurveda came back out of being suppressed by the colonial regime for 300 years, which is like five or six generations — it came back in these very Westernized, sort of high-tech medical institutions. And so it's almost like pulse, tongue, script — very allopathic in its practice, and very reduced to the physical layers, in India even. And so there are many people who focus on that, and they focus very much on just the physical body. For me, everything that's happening in the physical body had a root cause in either lifestyle or emotional wellness — and likely both. That's where all of our root causes are, right? So when I begin my work with somebody — and I'm very unique in this because I do have the training in the psycho-spiritual arts with yoga, with Ayurveda, and with psychiatry — I do want to know everything that's happening in the patterns in their physical body: What's happening with your digestion, with your sleep, with your skin, which diagnoses do you have? But also understanding what you have taken in through your life experience. What traumas we went through in our earlier years and what our stressors are presently all matter — they are affecting us, right? And so understanding all of that helps me then point to: \"Okay, this pattern in the body has a root cause here with this pattern in your lifestyle.\" So let's simultaneously attend to the patterns in the body with natural remedies and tools and practices, but also address the root cause pattern in the lifestyle. That’s when true healing happens. Because otherwise, this swapping out for a natural remedy is very beneficial — obviously, we have fewer side effects, we have the fact that every Ayurvedic remedy inherently includes rejuvenation. And so, if you rejuvenate a tissue system, it’s going to function more optimally. So there is sort of a healing element already within the natural remedy. That in and of itself is great and beneficial. However, if everything in lifestyle and everything in the emotional realms remain the same, we've got the nidus for the disease pattern in the body still present — and likely we'll see a recurrence of those patterns. So there is the option for symptom alleviation, but there is also the option for going deeper and addressing the root causes and removing them or shifting them. And that's what creates true healing, which we don't have that opportunity for in the allopathic setting, unfortunately."

        "Then let's go into a little bit of concrete examples of how you incorporate Ayurveda into someone who is also seeing a medical provider who’s practicing allopathic medicine. So how do you see those two pieces working together? And can you give us some concrete examples? For example, someone comes in with metabolic syndrome or pre-diabetes. How are you approaching this person?",
        "Mohan: Yeah, sure. So, that we now know with the latest research is really cortisol-mediated. And so then we would be looking to: what are the perspectives? What are the practices? What are the routines? What are the triggers that are the root causes of that sustained high, you know, sympathetic nervous system function that then is having these downstream effects of creating metabolic challenges and insulin resistance, right? So yes, we would look at those root causes, but at the same time we would bring in herbs that support the insulin resistance, support reestablishment of metabolism—really starting with digestion. You have to, with that specific example, in that specific case, it really is very much in the nervous system and the digestive system.

Obviously, this is affecting her lifestyle to a great degree, so a lot of emotional challenges with that. And within one year, she has completely healthy digestive function.

We're not feeling. And it's all about ignoring these subtle signs in the body until they become diseases and disorders.

Whether it's tackling chronic inflammation, sorting through emotional stressors, or simply relearning how to respond to our body's needs each day.

We also learned why Ayurveda aims far beyond symptom relief. Yes, there are powerful herbs and time-tested practices, but the true goal is addressing root causes, often tucked away in our daily routines and emotional patterns.
