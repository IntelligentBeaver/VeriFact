        "Migraine can be far more than a headache — an attack can come with warning signs such as vision problems and difficulty speaking. A migraine flare can last anywhere from two hours to three days. Women are three times more likely than men to have migraine, and up to 25% of women have migraine before their period.",
        "But what comes next? The start of menopause comes with many other symptoms, such as hot flashes and anxiety. As your body makes less of the hormones that lead to menstrual migraine, you might expect them to fade as you enter this new phase. Instead, some women keep experiencing migraine, and sometimes, their attacks are worse than before. So why does migraine continue into perimenopause?",

Hormone therapy isn't a silver bullet for hormonal migraine, but it could help level out your hormones to limit hot flashes and help you get better sleep, which may lead to fewer migraine episodes in the long run. Your health care provider will consider your age, medical history, and other health factors to help find the best treatment option for you."
