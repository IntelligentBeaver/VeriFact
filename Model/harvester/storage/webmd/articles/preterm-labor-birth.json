        "Contractions and dilation (opening) of the cervix before 37 weeks of pregnancy are considered preterm, or premature, labor. A normal pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks after the first day of the last period (38 weeks after fertilization). The danger of preterm labor is that it will lead to the birth of a baby that has not fully developed, and therefore has a high risk of complications. About 10% of all pregnancies result in premature birth. About 60% of serious complications or infant deaths are due to consequences of premature birth.",
        "Preterm labor can be extremely frightening, because mothers-to-be quite naturally fear that their baby will be born too early and suffer the problems of prematurity. If your baby is born too soon, there is a great chance that their lungs will be underdeveloped. If so, they'll need to be put onto a ventilator that can breathe for them. Receiving oxygen through a ventilator can lead to complications.",
        "Your baby may also have trouble maintaining a normal body temperature , and may become hypothermic (too cold). They'll need to be kept warm. Your baby might be so early that they can't coordinate their muscles to suck and swallow. If this is the case, they'll have to be fed through a needle in the vein (intravenously), or through a tube passed into their nose, down their throat and into their stomach . A premature baby may also develop complications such as bleeding into the brain ; an increased risk of infections, especially meningitis and sepsis ; problems with kidney function; and jaundice . Premature babies are at higher risk for long-term complications, which may include vision impairment or blindness, hearing impairment, cerebral palsy and chronic lung problems. The earlier the baby is born, the more likely that they will have these complications.",

A number of other medications are still being investigated for this use, including prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors ( indomethacin ), calcium -channel blockers, aminophylline and progesterone .

This choice is usually made when the mother is suffering from an infection of the amniotic fluid and uterus, or has illnesses such as severe preeclampsia or eclampsia (forms of high blood pressure that occur during pregnancy). Delivering the baby prematurely may also be preferable if fetal evaluation shows that the fetus is not doing well, if there is placenta previa (placenta covering the cervix) that bleeds a lot, if there is abruptio placentae (detachment of the placenta) or if certain birth defects or malformations are identified.",

That way, you can be sure that you are in the best of health before pregnancy . Your practitioner will screen you for risk factors of premature delivery and discuss which precautions you could take. Measuring the length of the cervix using a special transvaginal ultrasound probe can predict a woman's risk of delivering prematurely. This is usually done in the doctor's office between 20 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. Researchers are studying vaginal secretions called cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin as a possible predictor of preterm labor. A woman at increased risk for premature delivery can be forewarned about what to do if symptoms occur, and may undergo further screening tests."
