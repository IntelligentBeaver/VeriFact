        "There’s no single number on the scale that all kids must reach to be healthy. The right range depends on how tall they are, their gender, and their age. In fact, many children shouldn’t actually lose weight -- they should just maintain it as they grow taller or put on pounds more slowly. But if they have more severe obesity, espeically if they have obesity-related health conditions, your child's pediatrician may make a different recommendation.",
        "How can you tell if your child needs to slim down? Talk to their health care provider. They can help you come up with a safe plan. Also, some expert advice may help you know what to focus on to help your child reach a healthy weight, no matter their age."

Are other kids bullying them about their size?Are they trying to model a celebrity’s physique? Those are not good reasons to try to lose weight. Make sure they understand that looks aren’t the important part -- it’s about making healthy choices so they have the energy to move and think. Then, you can talk about specific ways to support them, like keeping junk food out of the house or planning a family walk or bike ride each evening. Does your child want to try a weight loss plan? Some programs are tailored for older kids. They may be safe and helpful, but always speak with your child’s doctor before they start a plan of their own.",

They don’t have to tackle it all at once -- shorter sessions throughout the day work just as well. At this age, they probably aren’t as interested in running around at the playground. “Help them find a type of exercise they enjoy, such as dance or a certain sport,” Muth says."
