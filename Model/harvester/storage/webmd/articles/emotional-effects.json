Behavioral therapy can help you cope with your pain and deal with any limitations or depression you're experiencing as a result.",

Jamison describes two types of back pain patients. \"There are the folks who throw in the towel and refuse to get off the couch or bed…and those who refuse to sit down and pace themselves.\" Neither approach is going to help your back feel better. Don't do more than you can comfortably handle, but don't become a couch potato either. Exercise is actually good for managing low back pain and stress for many people. However, depending on your health and medical reason for back pain, certain exercises may be harmful. Make sure to discuss an exercise regimen with your doctor first if you have chronic back pain.",

Keep your mind occupied -- that does help people cope with the condition.\" Get together with friends, go to the movies or a show, or take a walk outside to keep your mind off your pain."
