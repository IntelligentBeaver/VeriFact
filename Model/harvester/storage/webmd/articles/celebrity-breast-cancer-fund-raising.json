        "When the powers-that-be at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston heard that singer Sheryl Crow, a nine-time Grammy Award winner, was headed their way to do a concert in Fenway Park last July, they called her to ask a favor. Would she mind stopping by to talk to patients?",
        "The 44-year-old singer, who successfully underwent breast cancer breast cancer earlier this year, obliged cheerfully, telling the Dana-Farber staff she was happy to give back to those fighting the disease.",
        "Crow talked to women and doctors at the institute's women's cancer center and its children's clinic. The unannounced visit, says Lisa McEvoy, a Dana-Farber spokeswoman, \"came as a huge surprise to those waiting for appointments or receiving chemotherapy , bringing smiles to many patients' faces.\"",
        "A month later, Crow was scheduled to give another Boston concert. A few weeks before the concert, two tickets, plus a \"meet-and-greet\" with Crow, were auctioned off at a Dana-Farber fund-raiser called the Jimmy Fund Radio-Telethon. \"The winning bid for the tickets was $1,100,\" McEvoy says. In all, the telethon raised nearly $3 million, and celebrity star power was part of the reason for the success, she says.",
        "These days, celebrities are increasingly embracing all types of health-related causes -- testifying before Congress to lobby for more funds for research; donating time to appear on public service announcements to encourage people to get screened for diseases; and taking active roles at fundraising dinners, walks, and other events. \"The bigger the name, the more they raise,\" says Janet Keller, a spokeswoman for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where star-studded fundraising events for breast cancer research and other causes are plentiful."
