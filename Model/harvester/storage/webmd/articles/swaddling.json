        "Swaddling is an ancient practice of wrapping up a baby to help them sleep. It's been gaining popularity over recent years, with an estimated 90% of babies in North America being swaddled in their first few months.",
        "Swaddling recreates the cozy feeling of the womb and can help soothe an infant. Safety, however, is a concern with swaddling because of hip problems or suffocation that can happen when swaddling is not done correctly. So it's important to learn how to do it properly, as well as to know the benefits and risks of swaddling.",
        "Swaddling your newborn can calm them down and help them sleep better and in the right position, on their back. Doctors recommend this sleeping position in babies to lower their risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) . Eventually, your baby will outgrow the swaddle. Here's what you need to know.",
        "Is swaddling safe?",
        "Swaddling can be safe when done correctly. It can help babies sleep better and may be especially helpful with babies born with brain conditions, colic, or an alcohol addiction. It's important to remember that babies don't have to be swaddled, but if they are, loose blankets should be avoided. And if the baby is swaddled for longer times during the day or night, a sleep sack that lets their legs move should be used vs. a fitted blanket.",

        "Better sleep. For babies, being swaddled is like being back in the womb. Some parents note that their baby is able to sleep more deeply with less startle reflex. A small study of 16 babies aged 10-16 weeks found that swaddling increases the amount of time they stay asleep and lowers the number of times they startle and wake by themselves, but more research is needed.",
        "Less crying. Research has shown that when paired with sound and movement, swaddling can help babies cry less. A study on 368 babies who cried excessively found that babies under 7 weeks old cried slightly less after being swaddled.",
        "Premature babies. Swaddling has been found to help premature babies with improved development of nerves and muscles and better organization of motor movement.",
        "Sleep position. Parents who swaddle their babies are more likely to place them flat on their back when swaddled, which is the recommended sleep position for babies. ‌",
        "Increased risk of SIDS. There are about 3,500 baby sleep-related deaths a year in the U.S. Placing babies on their stomach to sleep is considered to be one of the most significant risk factors for SIDS , the sudden and unexplained death of a baby under the age of 1. Swaddling further increases this risk. Some researchers believe that SIDS can be caused by low arousal while an infant is sleeping, which means it's harder for them to wake up. Swaddling a baby may lower their arousal.",
        "Loose bedding. If your swaddle isn't properly done, your baby can wriggle out. This means that the swaddling cloth is left loose in the crib, which can block your baby's airway. Loose bedding increases the risk of SIDS.",
        "Overheating. As the swaddle is an extra layer, you should make sure your baby doesn't overheat. Touch their chest or back of the neck to see if they feel sweaty or warm. Remove a layer of clothing or switch to a lighter, more breathable swaddle material such as muslin or cotton.",
        "Developmental dysplasia of the hip. Improper swaddling can increase the risk of hip dysplasia . This is a problem with the way the hip joint forms. The hip joint is a ball and socket joint. In developmental dysplasia of the hip, the ball of the hip isn't centered in the socket and, in some cases, may slide in and out of it. Studies show a connection between tight swaddling and hip dysplasia. For natural development of the hips, your baby's legs have to be able to move up and out at the hips."
