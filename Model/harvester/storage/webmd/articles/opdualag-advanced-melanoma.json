        "Some cancer cells have what are called checkpoint proteins on their surface. The immune cells in our body also have proteins on their surface. When these proteins bind to each other, the T cells in our body get turned “off,” which stops them from killing cancer cells. Opdualag prevents these proteins from binding to each other, which turns the T cell back “on” and allows it to do its job of attacking and killing the tumor cell.",
        "Opdualag contains two active ingredients: nivolumab and relatlimab. Each of these ingredients blocks a different protein on the T cell. Relatlimab blocks the LAG-3 protein, while nivolumab blocks the PD-1 protein. By blocking these proteins, Opdualag reactivates T cells, making them more able to destroy melanoma cells."
