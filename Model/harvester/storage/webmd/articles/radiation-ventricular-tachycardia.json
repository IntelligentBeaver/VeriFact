        "Right now, radiation isn’t a standard option to treat your irregular heartbeat. Doctors recently issued recommendations for cardiac SBRT for ventricular tachycardia. It’s generally only an option now if you don’t get better with other treatments, including catheter ablation. Experts say cardiac radiation therapy remains experimental. So its safety and effectiveness aren't yet proven.",
        "It’s best to get it as part of a clinical trial or registry at a specialized center with experts in both irregular heartbeats and SBRT. One of the reasons it’s a challenge is because the heart is a moving target. Experts say it shouldn’t be used except in people who already had a catheter ablation that didn’t work. It might also be an option if you can’t have a catheter ablation.",
