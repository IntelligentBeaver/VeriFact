        "Nov. 3, 2023 – Wearing a heavy lead apron is no longer necessary during routine dental X-rays, a professional dental radiology group has concluded.",
        "Potential exposure of other body parts to what scientists call “external radiation scatter” is no longer a health threat because modern dental X-ray technology is safer. The recommendation by the American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology was published recently in The Journal of the American Dental Association .",
        "Dental radiographs have been standard practice for about 70 years. They can help dental providers detect tooth decay , bone and gum disease , infections, and tumors. The authors of the new guidelines examined the risk of thyroid cancer after exposure to dental X-rays, as well as the potential impact on pregnant people and their unborn babies.",
        "“There is ample evidence in scientific literature that shows that the apron and thyroid collar do not provide any additional benefit,” co-author Aruna Ramesh, DMD , a professor and associate dean for academic affairs at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine, said in a news release ."
