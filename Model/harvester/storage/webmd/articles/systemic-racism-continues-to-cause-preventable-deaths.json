        "Aug. 4, 2023 – A new study indicates that systemic racism, which has spread into nearly every county in the U.S., continues to result in preventable deaths of people of color.",
        "Nationwide, Black people, American Indian people, and Alaska Native people were more likely to die of any cause, compared to white people. Meanwhile, Asian people and Latino people had lower risks of death from any cause, compared to white people.",
        "The findings were published this week in The Lancet . Researchers analyzed death certificate information and county-level population characteristics from two national databases for the years 2000 to 2019. The combined information was used to estimate how many deaths could be linked to any of 19 different causes based on a person’s age, sex, county of residence, and racial-ethnic group.",
        "Noticeable differences along racial and ethnic lines appeared in nearly all of the more than 3,000 counties studied. American Indian and Alaska Native people were more likely than white people to die of skin and subcutaneous diseases, of HIV /AIDS, or of other sexually transmitted infections."
