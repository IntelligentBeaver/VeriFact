Also, the veins and arteries located in the knee and lower leg can be squeezed or compressed from movements during a sports event. The injury can damage the blood vessel and block the blood flow, resulting in a DVT.",

One reason for this type of injury is a part of the body called the thoracic outlet, the ring formed by the top ribs, just below the collarbone. This area contains muscles and bony structures. Inside these structures, veins, arteries, and nerves supply the arm with blood. Large arm muscles take up more of this area, creating a space for the vein that is narrower than it should be. If the vein in the narrow outlet is injured, a DVT can form. If this happens you may feel swelling, pain, or numbness. But this is very rare."
