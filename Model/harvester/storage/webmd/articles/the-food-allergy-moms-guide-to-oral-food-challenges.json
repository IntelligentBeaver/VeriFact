        "Ah, the oral food challenge (OFC). Did you know that this is the only definitive food allergy test currently available? While bloodwork and skin testing provide clues about the likelihood of allergy (though not the severity), eating the food itself is the only way to know for sure if you are allergic. Named the “gold standard” of food allergy testing, the OFC requires time, patience, and courage. If you are new to the food allergy world or have your first OFC coming up, this is your guide to everything you need to know to be prepared.",
        "Let’s review the basics. What is an oral food challenge? An OFC is when you eat an allergen in increasing amounts over a period of time while under observation in a doctor’s office or hospital setting. The “doses” of the allergen usually include four to five rounds of eating the food with 15-minute wait periods in between. Once the full amount of allergen is consumed, you then stay for another hour or two to ensure no symptoms arise. The appointment usually takes about 4 hours – a long time! This test should only occur after bloodwork and skin testing show either negative or low positive results, giving the allergist the confidence that there is not a true allergy present.",
        "As I write this article, I am experiencing our 30 th OFC. My boys fall outside the norm with an exceptionally long roster of food allergies from their initial diagnoses as young children. We’ve spent a decade whittling down the list. The great news is that, in spite of all those tests, they each only required an EpiPen one time during an OFC. While those were disappointing outcomes, we felt safe in the care of our physician, and knowing for sure about those allergens was helpful. Two other OFCs caused mild symptoms (upset tummy, itchy mouth) that caused us to stop the test early. Years later, my oldest son ended up passing the two oral food challenges he’d “failed” before. Over the course of 30 OFCs, they added a combined TWENTY-EIGHT new safe foods to their diets."

        "HEALTH – Your child needs to be well for the OFC. You don’t want to introduce a new food during this test if there are any signs of a fever or any symptoms of illness. Immune systems need to be in tiptop shape!",
        "MEDICATION – No antihistamines for at least 5 days before an OFC. Confirm with your allergist about exact medicine limitations, including nasal sprays, inhalers, or other medications. The point of removing these drugs is to ensure that they do not mask any potential reaction during the test.",
        "FOOD – Ask your doctor about food before the OFC. I’ve had doctors who wanted a full belly and others who wanted no food before the test. My food allergy mom (i.e., I’m not a physician!) understanding of this difference in strategy includes providing a food “buffer” in the tummy balanced with maintaining your child’s appetite to eat all the allergen needed for the test.",
        "FOOD – You are typically responsible for bringing the actual food needed for the OFC. Practices may have some of the top allergens and/or powder forms of these foods, but I’ve always brought ours in. Confirm with your physician exactly what you need to eat for the OFC and ask if you can bring options. For example, you could bring both the nut and peanut butter for a peanut OFC. When we challenged green pea recently, I brought a can of peas, but then our allergist let my son do half of the challenge with green pea powder that they had in the office. Also ask if you can bring additional snacks or options to mix with the allergen. Usually, the doctor’s office will have basic options like applesauce or pudding, but I always bring my boys’ own safe treats to make the food appetizing. Keep in mind, they might really dislike the food they are challenging – so bring lots of options to help them (or even bribe them!) to get the doses down. I also usually bring a proper meal for them to eat once the observation time is over (if they have any appetite left).",
        "MEDICATION – You will be responsible for bringing your own epinephrine devices (two, always!) along with any other rescue medications, including antihistamines and inhalers.",
        "ENTERTAINMENT – These appointments are long. Now that my boys are older, they entertain themselves with iPads, books, or even homework. If your children are younger, it’s a bit more of an effort. Bring a variety of games, coloring or art projects, books, and an iPad to watch movies or play games. You can also bring a favorite lovie to help them feel comfortable.",
        "CLOTHES – If you have young kids, it’s a great idea to bring a change of clothes just in case of a reaction or spill. And regardless of age, I usually bring an extra sweatshirt in case anyone gets chilly."

        "WHAT TO EXPECT – If this is your first OFC, it’s really important to prepare your child as best as you can before the long appointment. We all manage situations better when we know what to expect! Hopefully, your allergist will walk both of you through the format of the OFC and answer any questions before you begin. I’ve always had an extra preparation chat with my boys before we headed into another OFC, reminding them of how much food they’ll be eating, what symptoms might arise, what to look for (or feel), and the possible outcomes, including passing (yay!) or ending the challenge due to a reaction.",
        "WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT – OFCs are a challenge. Literally. They take a long time, require you to eat a food you’ve strictly avoided and even feared, and can potentially end in a reaction. This can be overwhelming for kiddos and parents alike. It’s important to remind yourself and your child why this test matters. We want to include any and all safe foods in our diet for variety and nutrition. And we want to live with less fear and burden, so crossing allergens off is critical.",
        "WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE OFC – If your child passes the OFC, it is important to keep this food in their diet a few times a week moving forward. Double-check with your allergist, but I’ve always been told three to five times a week. This can feel a little overwhelming, especially if your kiddo doesn’t love the food. But there are so many options for foods these days beyond eating the straight protein. For example, my son just passed chickpea, and chickpea powder is in so many products these days. Managing expectations about this continuation of eating this new food will be helpful. If your child has any symptoms of a reaction and the OFC ends early, it will be disappointing for you both, but at least you will know for sure. You will then continue to strictly avoid the allergen just as you did before the challenge."
