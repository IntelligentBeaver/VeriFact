        "Most areas of the body can be treated with electrolysis, including the eyebrows, face, abdomen, thighs, breasts, and legs. There are generally no permanent side effects, but sometimes a temporary, slight reddening of the skin may occur.",

Some things you may want to ask about include: how the procedure will feel; how many visits you will likely need; how much each visit costs; how long each session lasts; how long the practitioner has been in business; and the number of clients they have treated.",
            "Make sure the electrologist uses the right technique. The practitioner should use needle electrolysis, which is the only permanent form of hair removal. Some places may advertise electrolysis but use electronic tweezers or photoepilators instead. These are not permanent hair removal procedures.",
            "Use common sense. When you go to your consultation, look around. Does the place look clean? Do the workers use disposable gloves or needles? Ask to meet the person who will be performing the electrolysis. If you are not comfortable with one technician, look for someone else to do the procedure. Personal comfort is essential to knowing you have made the right choice."
