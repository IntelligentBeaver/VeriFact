The ambassador for the U.N. World Food Programme and mom of two speaks out about why children should never go hungry. She also opens up about domestic abuse and how she found strength in song.",
        "The 35-year-old singer-songwriter doesn't just use her outsize talent to project lyrics or to coach hopefuls on The Voice , NBC's Emmy-winning singing competition. She also fires up her vocal cords to inspire others to get involved with good causes, like stamping out world hunger.",

Brands World Hunger Relief and ambassador against hunger for the World Food Programme (WFP), Aguilera makes public service announcements, urges people to be part of the solution -- donate just $1 to WFP and you'll feed four children -- and visits countries like Haiti, Ecuador, and Rwanda to help deliver food to women and children."

Do I venture away from straight cookie-cutter pop music and listening to exactly what my label wants to do and emulate what's popular? Or do I go against the grain and make a record that speaks to me?\"",
