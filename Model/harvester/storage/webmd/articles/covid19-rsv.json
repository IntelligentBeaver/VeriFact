        "Coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are two kinds of respiratory viruses that can infect you and have similar symptoms. It can be hard to tell the difference between infections caused by coronavirus, RSV , the common cold, and the flu. Coronavirus and RSV are common causes of respiratory illness in the fall and winter, but you can get them any time of year. Learn more about similarities and differences in symptoms, prevention, and other key aspects between RSV and coronavirus.",
