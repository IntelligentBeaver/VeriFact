        "In the U.S., teen birth rates and number of births to teen mothers have dropped steadily since 1990. In 2020, just over 158,000 infants were born to teens 15 to 19 years old, down 75 percent from 1991. That trend is driven both by the fact that fewer teenagers are having sex and that more of them use birth control when they do.",
