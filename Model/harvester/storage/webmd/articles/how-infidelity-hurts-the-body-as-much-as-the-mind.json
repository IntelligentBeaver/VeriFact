        "Dec. 3, 2024 – Around her 10-year wedding anniversary, Allyson Arons found out that her husband was having an affair with one of her closest friends. The infidelity started a year after she had given birth to their third child. Her mental health quickly got worse; she started having panic attacks and anxiety beyond anything she'd had in the past – but that was just the beginning.",
        "After Arons learned about the affair, her weight dropped and her body broke out with psoriasis . Her doctors later found multiple blood clots in her legs. She had never had any issues with psoriasis or blood clots.",
        "“They ran all the tests and couldn’t find any reason why I should have blood clots, and there’s no family history of this either,” Arons said. “My doctors could only say that my central nervous system was so shaken up because I went through a traumatic event.”",
        "Getting Cheated On Can Hurt You Physically, Too",
        "Those who’ve gone through romantic betrayal often have a higher risk of stress, anxiety, and depression . That’s not surprising. But along with those mental health challenges may come physical ailments, too."

Even after controlling for gender and socioeconomic status, they found that those who reported romantic betrayal by a partner were more likely to also report chronic health issues.
