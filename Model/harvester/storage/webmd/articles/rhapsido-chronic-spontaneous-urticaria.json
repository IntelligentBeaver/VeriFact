        "Rhapsido (remibrutinib) is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) . This is a condition that involves hives , causing you to feel very itchy and uncomfortable. Hives are itchy red bumps or welts on your skin that are often raised. They may feel warm to the touch and can be any size, big or small. The hives can last anywhere from 30 minutes to 24 hours. To be diagnosed with CSU, you have to have hives most days of the week for six or more weeks.",
        "Many times there is no known trigger for hives, making it hard to prevent and treat. Some people with CSU also have angioedema . Anyone can have CSU at any age, but it usually starts in your 20s, 30s, or 40s. You may be more likely to have CSU if you have allergies, eczema , asthma , or food allergies .",
