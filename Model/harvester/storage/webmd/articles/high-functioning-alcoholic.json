        "Although you may still hear people talking about “alcoholism” or “ alcohol abuse ,” the official term is alcohol use disorder (AUD). It's a condition that ranges from mild to moderate to severe. And it’s all still problem drinking, even if you think it's “mild.” If AUD goes unrecognized and untreated, it’s linked to risks in many aspects of your health and life.",
        "People can have this condition even if they seem to have a great “outside life,” with a job that pays well, home, family, friendships, and social bonds, says Sarah Allen Benton, a licensed mental health counselor and author of Understanding the High-Functioning Alcoholic . They can appear responsible and productive. They might even be high achievers or in positions of power. And their success may lead people to overlook their drinking.",
