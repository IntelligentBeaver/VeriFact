Insulin is a hormone that your pancreas makes to help your cells take up sugar from your blood. With insulin resistance, your cells become resistant to insulin, so your cells don't take in sugar from your blood very well. This makes your blood sugar levels rise, which can cause damage to your organs and increase your risk of heart disease, kidney disease, and vision loss. About 38 million people in the U.S. have diabetes, and about 90%-95% of these people have type 2 diabetes."
