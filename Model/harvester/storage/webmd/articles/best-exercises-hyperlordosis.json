        "Hyperlordosis, also known as a “hollowback” or “swayback,” is an excessive curvature of the lower spine. This part of your spine is known as the lumbar region. There should be a slight curve there, but not an excessive one. When your back is curved too far, it can cause pain and spinal damage as well as a protruding stomach.",

Hyperlordosis generally involves tight, tense muscles in the front of the body and weak muscles in the back. As a result, it’s possible to correct these cases of hyperlordosis through exercises that target the muscles of the back, thighs, and hips . This helps your muscles maintain your spine’s alignment.",
