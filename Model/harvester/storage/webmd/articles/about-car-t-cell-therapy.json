A technician will insert an IV into a vein into each of your arms. One of these will collect your blood. This blood will then pass through a machine that separates your white blood cells, including your T cells, from the rest of your blood. Once the white blood cells have been removed, the remaining blood will be returned to your body via the IV in your other arm. Central venous catheter (central line). The technician inserts a small, thin tube called a catheter into a vein near your heart. It will be connected to two IV lines. One will draw blood, while the other line will return the remaining blood to your body."

During step three, scientists will grow millions more of them in the lab. This part of the process takes 2 to 4 weeks. When enough T cells have grown, the lab will freeze and prep them for transportation to your treatment site. During this waiting period, you may need to have something called “bridging therapy.” Bridging therapy aims to keep your DLBCL from getting worse while your newly created T cells are being prepared to go to work. It involves cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiation, and other therapies. Your health care team will decide what’s best for you based on your current health and how you have responded to past treatments. You may not need bridging therapy if your cancer is stable. Another thing that will determine your need for bridging therapy is the wait time until your CAR T-cell therapy. Your health care team will decide if you can go without treatment for those 2 to 4 weeks or longer if necessary."
