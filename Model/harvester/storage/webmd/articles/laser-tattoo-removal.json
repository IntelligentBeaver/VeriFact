        "Nearly 30% of people in the U.S. have at least one tattoo. Almost half of all millennials have one. But not all of them are happy about their decision. As many as 25% of those with a tattoo say they regret getting it.",
        "If you’re in that 25%, there is good news. Laser tattoo removal techniques can significantly diminish the appearance of your unwanted tattoo with minimal side effects.",
        "Laser tattoo removal is a treatment to help diminish the appearance of unwanted tattoos. During this treatment, dermatologists or technicians use lasers to send out high-intensity pulses of light that target the ink inside your tattoo but leave the skin around it alone. As the ink absorbs these pulses of light, it begins to heat up. This heat makes the ink break into tiny pieces, which your immune system can then clear away. Your tattoo starts to fade as the ink goes away.",
