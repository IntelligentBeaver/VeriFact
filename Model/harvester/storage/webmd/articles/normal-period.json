For example, as you near menopause, your periods may be more irregular.

        "Every month, your body prepares to get pregnant. Your ovaries release an egg. Hormones rise and fall. This is your menstrual cycle. It starts on the first day of your last period and ends on the first day of your next period. Though the average cycle is 28 days long, anything between 21 and 34 days is considered normal. Periods normally last from two to seven days. For the first year or two after menstruation begins, teens tend to have longer cycles that don't start at the same time every month. Adults assigned female at birth often have more consistent cycles. Then, as they near menopause, their cycles often get more irregular again. If you're on birth control pills or have an IUD , it can change the timing of your period. Ask your doctor what's normal for your form of contraception ."

Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can affect your menstrual cycle. These two conditions cause your thyroid gland to produce too much (hyper) or too little (hypo) thyroid hormone. Uterine fibroids. Noncancerous growths in the uterus can cause heavy bleeding or irregular periods. Endometriosis. This condition involves the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which can cause pain and irregular bleeding."
