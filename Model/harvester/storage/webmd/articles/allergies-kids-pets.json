        "When you have seasonal allergies, a key part of your allergy management is to limit how often you’re around certain allergens, like pollen and mold. When you add kids and pets to the mix, you’ve now got even more factors for tracking allergens into the house. You not only have to worry about whether you shook off all the pollen before you came inside; you’ve got to make sure your kids and your pets did, too. And that’s not all. Of course, you won’t develop an allergy to your children, but people with seasonal allergies are more likely than others to have pet allergies, too. It’s pretty likely that not only will the pollen on your dog’s or cat’s fur make you sneeze, but your furry friend’s coat itself may prompt a string of achoos as well."

Pollen counts tend to be lowest in the late afternoon and evening. Plan walks and visits to the dog park for these lower-pollen times. Try omega-3 fatty acids Ask your veterinarian about giving your dog these oil supplements. They can relieve itching and, as an added bonus, soften your pet’s coat. Try local honey This tip is for dogs only. There are theories that because local honey contains local pollen, it can work almost like a vaccine for people and dogs.
