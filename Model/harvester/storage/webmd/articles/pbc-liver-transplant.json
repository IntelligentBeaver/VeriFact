        "If primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) advances to liver failure, you’ll need an organ transplant. This is when doctors remove your unhealthy liver and replace it with a healthy one. A liver – either the whole organ or part of one – could come from someone who has died or from a living donor. It could take many months to find out whether you’re ready for a liver transplant. This complex process will involve your hepatologist, a doctor who diagnoses and treats disorders of the liver and bile ducts. They could also refer you to a center that does liver transplants. At the first sign of liver failure, or if you have late-stage PBC, your doctor should refer you for a liver transplant, even if you’re not sick."

They’ll explain what to expect and answer your questions along the way. Here are some things you may want to know as you prepare for a transplant: Do I have other treatment options besides a liver transplant? What are the pros and cons of a liver transplant? How do you judge if I’m a candidate for a liver transplant? How will I know if I’m on the waiting list? How long could I wait to have a transplant? How long has the hospital been performing transplants for PBC? What are the chances of the organ working and the patient surviving a PBC transplant at this hospital? How does this measure against other hospitals? How do you know if you’ll accept a specific liver? Do you do living donor transplants? Am I eligible for this type of transplant? How do you perform living donor transplants?",
