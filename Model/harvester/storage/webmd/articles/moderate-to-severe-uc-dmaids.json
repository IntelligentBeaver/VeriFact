        "Disease-modifying anti-inflammatory drugs (DMAIDs) are a group of prescription drugs for certain autoimmune conditions, where an overactive immune system causes inflammation and pain. Disease-modifying drugs are medications you take to manage a condition. They don’t ease symptoms or cure the condition but instead affect the underlying cause to change how it progresses. Types of DMAIDs There are two main types of DMAIDs: Traditional DMAIDs. They’re also called immunosuppressants. Your doctor may prescribe one of these older, conventional DMAIDs first. Biologics. These are protein-based DMAIDs made in a lab. They target certain inflammation-causing molecules, cells, and pathways."

        "You may think about joining a clinical trial for a DMAID if other UC treatments caused side effects or haven’t worked for you. Ask your doctor about clinical trials for DMAIDs or search databases like ClinicalTrials.gov to find studies that might be a good fit for you. Drug companies, universities, hospitals, government agencies, and other organizations sponsor trials. They usually take place in medical centers or research institutions. Both volunteers and researchers must follow strict rules to make sure those who take part in clinical trials stay safe. The FDA has regulations to protect you. Before joining, volunteers learn all about the study, including potential risks. You must sign a consent form confirming your understanding of the trial."
