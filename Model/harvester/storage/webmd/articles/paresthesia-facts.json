        "Paresthesia is that \"pins and needles\" feeling that you've probably had at some point. Maybe you fell asleep with your arm pinned under you, or you kept your legs crossed too long. You might refer to it as your body part \"falling asleep.\" Paresthesia is the sensation that comes after that when you move and release the pressure that you had on your blood vessels or nerves.",
        "Usually, paresthesia is painless and harmless. The most common form is transient paresthesia, It means that the feeling is temporary or doesn't last long once your blood gets flowing again.",
        "But sometimes, it can be a sign of a more serious medical problem. If your tingling feeling lasts longer or happens often, it could be a sign of a condition, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or cubital tunnel syndrome. It could also be a sign of trouble with your circulation or nerve damage.",
