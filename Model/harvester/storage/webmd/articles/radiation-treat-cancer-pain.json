If your cancer has spread to a few areas of bone or there are too many spots to treat with external radiation, your doctor might want to try treatment with drugs that have radioactive material inside them. Your doctor will give you a shot of the treatment right into your vein through a tube (an IV). It will travel through your body and build up in the parts of your bone where there is cancer.",
        "For some people who get drug treatment, the pain gets worse for a few days right afterward, but that’s rare. Usually it takes between 1 and 4 weeks to work, and the relief you get from it can last up to 18 months."
