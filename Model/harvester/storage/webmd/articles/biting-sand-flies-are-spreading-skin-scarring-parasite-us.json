        "Oct. 20, 2023 – A parasitic skin disease spread by sand flies that was once only linked to international travel is no longer considered an “imported” disease in the U.S.",
        "Called cutaneous leishmaniasis, the disfiguring condition resulting from sand fly bites has now evolved into a form unique to the American South. The disease can be difficult to diagnose. At one time, it was so rare that it was not often considered possible when making a diagnosis. It can also mimic other diseases like leprosy , skin cancer , and fungal skin conditions , according to the CDC , which discussed the topic at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) this week in Chicago.",
        "Cutaneous leishmaniasis has been diagnosed in 86 people in the U.S. in the past decade who had not traveled internationally, the CDC researchers reported. They used genetic sequencing tools to analyze tissue samples from infected people to determine that the non-travelers had a unique version of the disease, meaning it was being spread by local fly populations."

        "The risk for sand fly bites is greatest at twilight and at night, when the insects are feeding. The disease can cause a variety of skin problems, including large nodules or plaques that usually show up weeks or months after infection. Sores from the disease can change in appearance and size over time, becoming open sores with a raised border and central crater or ulcer that can be covered with crust or scales, the CDC says. Even without treatment, most sores eventually heal, even after lasting for months or years. The resulting scarring is disfiguring."
