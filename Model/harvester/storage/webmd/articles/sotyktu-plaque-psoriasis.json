        "Plaque psoriasis , the most common form of psoriasis, is an autoimmune condition , which means that the body’s immune cells attack its own healthy cells. In people with plaque psoriasis, the immune system attacks healthy skin cells, which causes swelling (inflammation) . This can lead to the formation of too many skin cells, causing discolored patches on the skin. These patches, which are known as “plaques,” are sections of thick, raised skin that may be covered with a thin silvery-white scale."

        "People with plaque psoriasis have “flare-ups,” or times when their symptoms are most noticeable. These flare-ups can last weeks or even months. Many different “triggers” can make psoriasis worse or cause a flare-up, including certain medicines. An infection, such as a cold or the flu, can also trigger a flare-up.

        "For most people, the key to treating plaque psoriasis is to avoid triggers, moisturize the skin, and apply topical treatments as prescribed. But this does not always work for people with very bad symptoms. People with more severe plaque psoriasis may need treatments that target the body’s overactive immune system.",

TYK2 plays an important role in the process that ultimately leads to swelling. By blocking TYK2, Sotyktu can reduce the swelling in the skin in people with plaque psoriasis, reducing symptoms."
