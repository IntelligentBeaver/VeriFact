        "Leslie Glass, 33, and her husband, Heath, have three children. Garrett, age 5, was conceived without assisted reproduction. Toddler twins Bella and Madi were conceived through IVF after Leslie suffered ectopic pregnancies and doctors warned the couple not to try to get pregnant on their own again. The Glasses, of Johns Creek, GA, paid $22,000 for three rounds of IVF and figured it was their last chance to have more children. So they had two embryos transferred, and both succeeded. Bella and Madi will be 3 in June .",
        "Leslie spoke to WebMD about her experiences.",
        "I did [want twins] because it was so expensive and I knew that this was probably it for us. We didn't go in there and say, we'd like twins. It was, 'We can't get pregnant, we need your help, this is the only way we can do it, and if we get twins, all the better.' Because whether we had twins or one, it's still $22,000. So if this is it, then let's just complete the family."
