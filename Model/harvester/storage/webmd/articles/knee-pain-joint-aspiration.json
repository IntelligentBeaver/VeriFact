        "Joint aspiration (also called arthrocentesis) is a procedure that sucks fluid from your knee , hip, shoulder , or other joints. Your doctor may do it to help with swelling and fluid related to an injury, infection, or another health condition. Joint aspiration can also help to diagnose arthritis or other joint problems. Your doctor looks at the fluid to find out what type of arthritis you have, like gout or rheumatoid arthritis .",
