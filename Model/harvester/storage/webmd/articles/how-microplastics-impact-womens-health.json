        "May 15, 2025 -- Microplastics – tiny plastic particles found in water, food, soil, and even dust – are an emerging health concern. These particles, along with the chemical additives in plastics, can enter our bodies through inhalation and ingestion. Research now links microplastics not only to inflammation and hormone disruption but also to specific risks in women’s health. What can we do about this growing concern? How can we minimize the presence of microplastics in our bodies? We spoke to Jane Van Dis, MD , founding member of Physician and Scientist Network Addressing Plastics and Health and founder of OBGYNs for Sustainable Future, about where microplastics are showing up in the environment, the unique health risks they pose to women, common myths about plastics and health, and what practical steps we can take to reduce our exposure.",

As you might imagine, we inhale microplastics—plastics that are coming off of the tires. While some of them run in rivulets off of the road, some also get aerosolized. And so we actually inhale quite a few microplastics. And then we drink microplastics."

As you might imagine, we inhale microplastics—plastics that are coming off of the tires. While some of them run in rivulets off of the road, some also get aerosolized. And so we actually inhale quite a few microplastics. And then we drink microplastics.",

So, first is that what you hear often is, “Well, studies show that there may be links. We still don't have enough information to really make this connection yet. We are gonna need decades more of research.” But at this point, we really don't have the evidence to say that this exposure is causing these downstream health impacts.",

These particles, along with the chemical additives in plastics, can enter our bodies through inhalation and ingestion. Research now links microplastics not only to inflammation and hormone disruption but also to specific risks in women’s health. What can we do about this growing concern? How can we minimize the presence of microplastics in our bodies?",
