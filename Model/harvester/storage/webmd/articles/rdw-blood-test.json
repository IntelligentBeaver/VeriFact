        "An RDW blood test – also known as a red blood cell distribution width blood test – is a measure of the difference in your red blood cells’ size and volume. RDW is one part of a typical full blood workup called a complete blood count, or CBC. It’s one of the values doctors use to better understand the health of your circulatory system and, in some cases, diagnose disease.",
        "Even though the test includes the word “width,” it doesn’t measure the width of your red blood cells. “Distribution width” is a range or spread of values. It shows how much variation there is between the highest value and the lowest value. In the case of RDW, these values are the volume and size of your red blood cells.",
        "Your body makes red blood cells (erythrocytes) in bone marrow, the spongy tissue in the center of your bones. A red blood cell’s main job is to carry oxygen from your lungs to the tissues in your body. Your cells use the oxygen to grow, divide, and make energy for your body. Red blood cells also carry carbon dioxide waste away from the tissues back to the lungs. They use a protein called hemoglobin to do this.",
