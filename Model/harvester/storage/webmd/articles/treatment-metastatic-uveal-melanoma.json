        "There are no standard treatments once uveal melanoma has spread, but research is continuing and there is hope. Some treatments are: Immunotherapy Immunotherapy, treatment that uses your own immune system, seems fairly new to medicine, but scientists have known about it for over a century. The medical community didn’t pay much attention to its potential until the 1980s, when serious research into using immunotherapy to treat cancer began. A new immunotherapy drug, tebentafusp (Kimmtrak), was approved by the FDA in January 2022. Tebentafusp is given by IV (through a vein) once a week. In clinical trials, the drug cut the risk of death from metastatic uveal melanoma by half. But it does come at a cost. It’s estimated that it costs almost $19,000 per weekly vial, which adds up to between $400,000 and $500,000 for a year’s course of treatment."
