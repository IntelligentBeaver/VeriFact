        "If you have immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), your immune system attacks and destroys your platelets. Some signals that tell your immune system to destroy platelets are sent through a substance called spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK). Tavalisse is a prodrug. A prodrug is a medicine that does not work on its own. It gets turned into an active form (known as the active metabolite) after it is inside your body. So after you take Tavalisse, your body changes it inside your stomach so it can start working. Once your body converts Tavalisse into its active metabolite, it blocks SYK, which helps stop your immune system from destroying your platelets."

        "Tavalisse may cause problems with other medicines and vice versa. Many of these interactions are caused by the effects of Tavalisse and other medicines on enzymes called cytochrome P450 (CYP). These are enzymes in your liver that metabolize or break down medicines. Some medicines may speed up, slow down, or even completely block these enzymes. When this happens, the amount of medicine in your body may increase (similar to taking too much) or decrease (similar to taking too little). Either way, this may cause problems that can sometimes be serious.",
        "Medicines known as strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase your risk of side effects from Tavalisse because they can increase the levels of Tavalisse’s active metabolite. If you need to take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor while you are taking Tavalisse, your health care provider may need to give you a lower dose of Tavalisse to lower your risk of side effects.",
        "Medicines known as strong CYP3A4 inducers can reduce how well Tavalisse works for you because they can decrease how much Tavalisse is converted to the active metabolite (the form of the medicine that works in your body).
