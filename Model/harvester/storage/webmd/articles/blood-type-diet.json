        "People with different blood types also have different gut bacteria , which D’Adamo traces back to our early ancestors. His research suggests that the first humans had type O blood. Since they were hunter-gatherers, they ate fewer carbs and more protein.

He thinks B blood types can digest more fat because they supposedly evolved from nomadic tribes, whose diets were rich in meat and dairy.",

        "According to D’Adamo, proteins in certain foods called lectins can bind to your blood type antigen and make your blood stick together. This results in fatigue, headaches, digestive issues, and skin problems, he says. Eating foods that your body responds well to may improve your digestion, energy levels, and some chronic conditions, such as heartburn .",
        "D’Adamo also claims that each blood type is at a higher risk for some diseases. People with type O blood, for example, may be more likely to get stomach ulcers, while heart disease and diabetes are more common in people with type A blood. He says you may be able to lower your chances of getting some diseases by choosing a diet that works best with your blood type.",
        "Risks of the Blood Type Diet",
        "There’s no scientific evidence to support the benefits of the Blood Type Diet. In 2013, researchers studied all of the existing medical literature on the subject (1,415 references in total). They found no studies showing that the Blood Type Diet works. D’Adamo’s idea about ancestral blood types has also been questioned. Other researchers suggest that type AB may have actually been the first ever blood group, not O.",
        "Another study published in 2021 examined if people with heart disease could benefit from a plant-based diet depending on their blood type. No connection was found between blood types and their health outcomes.",
        "It’s worth noting that most of the foods suggested for the Blood Type Diet are healthy, but if you try the Type B diet, you should watch your red meat and dairy intake. As these foods are higher in saturated fat, having too much of either may raise your chances of heart disease.",
        "Does it allow for restrictions or preferences?",
        "Because the Blood Type Diet suggests very specific types of food, it doesn’t allow much for personal tastes. For example, if you're a big fan of meat, you won’t be very happy on the type A diet, which is mostly vegetarian. If you’re lactose intolerant, you may have a hard time with the B blood type diet, which recommends dairy. There are even suggestions about the types of spices and condiments you can use.",
        "If you’re looking for a gluten-free diet, you should know that the Blood Type Diet doesn’t ban gluten. You may be able to make gluten-free choices if you read food labels carefully.",
        "Level of effort: high",
        "You may need to limit your food choices. Your blood type will decide your shopping list and your choices when eating out. If you live with people who have different blood types, meal planning may be hard. Special packaged foods, however, aren’t required for this diet.",
        "What else you should know",
        "Cost. D’Adamo recommends a lot of specialty and organic foods (such as soy milk and carob chip cookies), which can be pricey. Vitamins and herbal supplements are also part of the diet.",
        "Support. Beyond D’Adamo’s book and website, you follow the Blood Type Diet on your own.",
        "Exercise. The Blood Type Diet suggests exercises based on your blood type. For instance, it suggests yoga or tai chi for blood type A, and vigorous aerobic exercises such as jogging or biking for up to an hour a day for type O. Type B, he says, should focus on group exercises, such as tennis, martial arts, or golf, while a mix of calming and aerobic exercise is best for AB types."

      "content": [
        "Does the Blood Type Diet work?",
        "Though the Blood Type Diet has been around for a while, Kathleen Zelman, MPH, RDN, LD, a registered dietitian nutritionist and former director of nutrition at WebMD, explains that the theory behind the diet has been debunked. “It’s somewhat of a gimmicky way to try to get people to eat healthier. There is absolutely no science to substantiate that your blood type dictates the kind of diet that you should be on,” she says.",
        "Zelman notes that elements of the Blood Type Diet do work since it’s mostly a healthy, plant-forward diet. She cites a 2014 study that found adults eating the type A diet showed improved health markers, but this occurred in everyone, not just those with type A blood type.",
        "The diet recommends high-quality food, lots of fruits and vegetables, fiber, vitamins and minerals, lean meats, and foods low in saturated fat. And, by cutting calories and getting rid of added sugar, you’re likely to lose weight.",
        "Still, if you follow the guidelines for just your blood type, it may not be the most useful option for you.",
        "Is the Blood Type Diet good for certain conditions?",
        "“The best diet is the one that you can stick with, and the best diet is the one that’s customized for you,” Zelman says. “And I wouldn’t call blood typing customized because it doesn’t really address other conditions.”",
        "Depending on your blood type, the diet outlined may not support treatment for heart disease, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol levels. For example, the type B diet has more saturated fat than the other types, which can put you at risk for heart disease. The fruits and vegetables that are in other parts of the diet plan are lower in saturated fat, however.",
        "“If you have heart disease or if you have diabetes, this diet could probably be modified, without eliminating some of the foods [D’Adamo] does, to improve your health. But it has nothing to do with your blood type,” she says.",
        "Zelman recommends that you check with your doctor or see a registered dietitian nutritionist before starting a diet such as the Blood Type Diet.",
        "Are there concerns about the recommended food guidelines in the Blood Type Diet?",
        "Zelman doesn’t find the foods listed for blood types O, A, B, and AB concerning, but she does see issues with what people are told to stop eating. For example, she says, “There’s really no sense in getting rid of eggplant.”",
        "Due to D’Adamo’s theory on lectins in certain foods causing health issues, many grocery list items aren’t included in the Blood Type Diet.",
        "“Foods like beans and whole grains that contain lectins -- they have good-for-you nutrients, and they shouldn’t be eliminated,” Zelman says.",
        "She also explains that while eating less processed foods can be good for your health, not all processed foods are bad. Milk and wheat, for example, need to be processed for safety reasons and to make them easier to digest.",
        "Finally, Zelman notes that it’s OK if you can’t always buy the organic versions of food recommended by the Blood Type Diet, which can be costly. “It’s much more important to eat more fruits and vegetables than to worry about whether they’re organic or not,” she says.",
        "Can kids try the Blood Type Diet?",
        "If your family tries the Blood Type Diet, it might be a challenge to meet everyone’s nutritional needs, especially if you strictly follow it. Zelman gives the example of avoiding dairy (part of the type O and A diets), which could be harmful to kids.",
        "“Dairy is so critically important to growth and development for kids to get enough calcium and vitamin D ,” she says.",
        "The general idea of the diet — fewer processed foods, less added sugars, and eating lean meats and lots of fruits and vegetables — are all good for everyone’s overall health, Zelman says. But once you start customizing the diet for your family, it’s not really the Blood Type Diet anymore.",
        "“There's no problem in modifying this diet to meet your family’s needs. But when I say modifying it, you’re essentially then following a healthy meal plan that's advocated by the American Heart Association, and by the Dietary Guidelines,” she says."
