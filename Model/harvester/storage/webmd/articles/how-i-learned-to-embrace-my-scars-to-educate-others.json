        "The keloid scar left behind by my chemo port has become one of the most prominent conversation starters in my life post-treatment. Outside of this permanent mark below my collarbone, there’s no blatantly visible evidence of my history of breast cancer. When my scar is in plain sight, it always prompts questions like, “What’s that from?” or “What’d you do there?”",
        "Five months of chemotherapy is what I did there.",
        "Initially, when I started getting these questions, I wasn’t sure how much I should share. I didn’t want to overwhelm anyone with my entire story. People’s curiosity never offended me because I trusted that it was genuine. Even so, it didn’t make it any less triggering to unintentionally be reminded of everything I’ve endured.",
        "The first few times people noticed my scar, I’d give them a vague answer and try to change the subject as quickly as possible. However, the more people kept asking about it -- whether it was on dates, hanging out with new groups of people, at parties, etc. -- the more I realized that this question was never going away. So instead of holding back my truth out of the fear of it being too much, I began allowing myself to freely and honestly embrace it."

        "One of the most vulnerable moments of my life was when I shared my story with a group of co-workers in college. It was a few weeks after my double-mastectomy surgery, and we were starting our staff meeting with an icebreaker. Each person drew a different question from a hat, mine being, “What is something we probably don’t know about you?” I immediately felt as if that question was somehow purposely placed in the hat for me.",
        "I listened to everyone else answer their questions while mentally debating whether to shift the lighthearted dynamic into a much heavier one. I almost persuaded myself into using my go-to answer -- I’m scared of dogs -- but something inside of me urged me to speak bravely. With tears streaming down my face, I shared everything I’d been going through the past several months."
