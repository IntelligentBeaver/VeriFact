        "All she wanted for her 40th birthday was a healthy body mass index ( BMI ). And three days before the big day, her dream came true: After 14 months on the WebMD Weight Loss Clinic plan, Jean had lost 50 pounds and was declared healthy with a BMI of 25!",
        "She'd kept her eye on her target, with a BMI chart posted above the scale she used for her weekly weigh-ins. But a lower BMI wasn't her only goal -- she was also determined to become eligible for an ice hockey team. Ice hockey had been her passion in college, and she longed to get back onto the ice.",
        "In fact, Jean had always been active until her two children came along, and she found herself too busy to exercise. A self-described \"jock,\" she'd never been overweight . But after the second baby, the Pittsburgh, resident found herself packing on the pounds.",
