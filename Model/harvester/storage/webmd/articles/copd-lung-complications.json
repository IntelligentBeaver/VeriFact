        "When you have COPD, your odds of catching a cold, the flu, and pneumonia rise. These respiratory infections worsen COPD by making it harder to breathe and damaging lung tissue even more. Experts suggest people with COPD get a flu vaccine every year. You may also want to think about getting vaccinated against pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia. There are two kinds of vaccines: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs, specifically PCV15 and PCV20) Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) Your age, health status, and vaccination history will determine which pneumococcal conjugate vaccine you should get. Lung cancer If you smoke and have COPD, you have a higher chance of getting lung cancer than a smoker without COPD. Research shows lung cancer and COPD may have the same underlying causes, like genetics and problems with cell energy. Your body can usually handle the harm from smoking and COPD with defense systems like antioxidants and DNA repair. But these defenses fail in both lung cancer and COPD. It’s also possible that COPD plays a role in lung cancer by causing extra stress on cells, leading to DNA damage, exposure to inflammation , and other factors."

Your lung may totally or partially collapse. Damage from lung diseases like COPD weakens lung tissue, raising your chances of a collapsed lung. Signs of the condition include abrupt pain in your chest and trouble taking a full breath. If you have these symptoms, see a doctor right away. Treatment for a collapsed lung involves removing the extra air in your chest with a needle or chest tube inserted between your ribs. A buildup of carbon dioxide When you breathe out, your lungs usually get rid of carbon dioxide. But with COPD, it builds up in your bloodstream.
