        "JULIA ROTOW: Current lung cancer screening guidelines, and here I'll cite the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend lung cancer screening for those at high risk as defined by cumulative years of tobacco use and age. So the current guidelines, which released in 2021, recommend screening for those 50 and older, technically 50 to age 80 with at least a 20 pack-year history of tobacco use. And that means either one pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years, two packs per day for 10 years, and so on. And that's considered to be high risk, and they recommend an annual low-dose screening CT scan. We know that by doing this screening, we can reduce the risk of death from lung cancer by catching lung cancer early when it's more treatable. This improves survival. Unfortunately, in this country, uptake of lung cancer screening has been very low. And in many studies, only 15% to 30% of people who are eligible for lung cancer screening actually have this done. And that's a real missed chance to catch lung cancers at an early stage particularly with all these different advances we're seeing improving outcomes for early stage lung cancer."

        "RAMI MANOCHAKIAN: My name is Dr. Rami Manochakian. I'm a thoracic medical oncologist and an associate professor of medicine at Mayo Clinic, Florida. We're here today at the ASCO Annual Meeting. That's the annual meeting for the American Society of Clinical Oncology, where new updates and advancements in cancer research and cancer treatments are presented annually. I'm here to tell you today about a major clinical trials and study that the investigator of this study reported their results yesterday in what we call a plenary session, which is one of the major sessions of this conference. This study is about patients with early stage lung cancer in particularly, stage one to stage three, when the cancer is still curable. It's about a patient population whose cancer has a special driver of the cancer. We call it a mutation, in particular, EGFR mutation. It's something that is believed to be the driver of the cancer growth. And for these patients, after they undergo surgery to take out their tumors, this study looked at giving these patients a targeted therapy, a drug that is called osimertinib, which is a drug that is already approved and used for patients who have advanced lung cancer with that mutation, but looked at giving it to them early if they have an early stage cancer and they undergo surgery to see if it could actually make a difference."

In lung cancer cells, that can be made abnormally active by having a mutation which causes it to turn on when it should not. And this, we know, helps to drive lung cancer formation and growth and survival. And this is by targeting EGFR with EGFR inhibitors, which can shut down that protein and stop that survival signal, can improve outcomes for patients with this subtype of lung cancer.",
