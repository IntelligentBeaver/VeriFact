        "Steven Siracuse was about 19 years old when his psoriasis got bad. Rash -like patches showed up on his elbows, forearms, knees, calves, and scalp. A college freshman at the time, he covered up in long-sleeve shirts to avoid questions and stares. He also used steroid creams that didn’t help.",

They have it all over the face. ... I always tried to keep that in perspective and tell myself that I was fortunate compared to other people.”",
        "Over the years, Siracuse did what he could to manage the physical and mental effects of psoriasis . He worked closely with his dermatologist to find the right treatment and get his insurance company to cover it. He made the move from a high- stress job to a lower-stress one. He quit smoking cigarettes and cut back on alcohol . He patiently explained what the patches on his skin were when people asked questions or made comments that hurt."
