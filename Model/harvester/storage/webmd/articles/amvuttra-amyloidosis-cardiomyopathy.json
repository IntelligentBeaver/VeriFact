        "Amyloidosis is a condition where a protein called amyloid builds up in your organs and tissues. It can be hereditary, meaning it is passed down in families due to broken genes, or it can happen naturally due to aging. Amyloidosis can lead to organs not working the way they are supposed to. There are many types of amyloidosis. Amvuttra (vutrisiran) is used to treat two kinds of amyloidosis. The first is known as hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR) with polyneuropathy and the second is known as transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM ).",
