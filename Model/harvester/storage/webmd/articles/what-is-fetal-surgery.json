When a fetus has a birth defect, the issue usually gets worse as they develop. A team of experts can treat and improve these defects early before birth. Your doctor may have to perform this type of surgery to save the fetus or help their long-term health. For less severe cases, your surgeon might call it \"fetal intervention.\"",
