        "The numerous transformations of my chest over the last 5 years still amaze me. As a brief overview, I went from discovering a lump in my left breast to having a double mastectomy with reconstruction via tissue expanders, and then from tissue expanders to implants. There was an unexpected hurdle after my subsequent sarcoma diagnosis last year, during which I had the left implant removed. That required me to start the breast reconstruction process over again, using a tissue expander and a flap from my back. Finally, in my surgery this August, I had the tissue expander exchanged for an implant and a nipple graft to make my nipples more symmetrical.",
        "Going into my last surgery, my left nipple was extremely high up, while my right one was very low, making them as asymmetrical as possible. Although they were never perfect to begin with, they drifted farther apart with each of these procedures. I was hopeful that the graft could help restore at least some sense of symmetry to them. However, I was also nervous, knowing that partial or complete nipple loss was a risk of the procedure."

        "In addition to informing me of the risks, my surgeon apologized in advance for the additional scars I’d have. I told him that I didn’t mind “adding more to the collection.” They’re a visual reminder of everything I’ve been through (not that I could forget) and an opportunity to educate others on breast health whenever they come up in conversation. With all our bases covered, the surgical team rolled me back to the operating room, and I counted to 10 as the anesthesia kicked in.",
        "Upon waking up from the procedure, in a loopy state, the first question I asked was, “Do I still have my nipple?” The nurse laughed and happily informed me that I did and the surgery was successful. I didn’t see the results until my post-op appointment the following week. The medical assistant told me that my nipple might look a little scary at first, but not to freak out because it’ll heal and have its form restored over time. After all the bandages and tape were removed, I looked in the mirror and was grateful to see that my breasts are almost perfectly symmetrical and the new implant is in good shape."

        "I certainly didn’t think that it’d require this many procedures to reach this point, sometimes questioning if it was all worth it. A few months ago, another survivor asked me if I ever considered flat closure following my double mastectomy. It honestly wasn’t something that I explored, and I’d be lying if I said that it wasn’t because I was concerned about my body image. Being 21 at the time of my diagnosis, I was focused on having my breasts look as natural as possible following my procedure. I believed that reconstruction was the best route to achieve this.",
        "I’ve learned a lot since I was 21, and looking back, whether I chose to pursue reconstruction or to go flat didn’t define my femininity. Our breasts, just like our bodies, come in all different shapes and sizes. Contrary to what society programs us to believe, there’s no ideal body type. I believe that health is always the most important factor, and a mantra I live by is that you only look as good as you feel inside. Whether that means reconstruction or going flat, each choice is valid and deeply personal. Ultimately, I’m glad that I had the opportunity to do reconstruction and find a new normal that I was comfortable with."
