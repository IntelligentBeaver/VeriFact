While studies have found that some people who regularly take aspirin have a lower risk of certain cancers, like colorectal cancer , the findings are nuanced. Another analysis from Murray and colleagues’ long-term trial showed that older people who took aspirin to prevent a first-time heart attack or stroke had an increased risk of developing cancer, and in particular, being diagnosed at stage 3 or later. The “findings suggest that in older persons, aspirin may accelerate the progression of cancer and, thus, suggest caution with its use in this age group,” said Murray."
