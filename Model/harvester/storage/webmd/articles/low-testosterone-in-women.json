        "If your body doesn't get enough of a hormone called testosterone, you may have low levels. Testosterone can contribute to a lower sex drive. But how low testosterone impacts women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB) isn't clear.",
        "Your testosterone normally peaks in your 30s and 40s before it starts to drop. It's unknown why it falls as you get older. But you need it to make another hormone called estrogen. Estrogen is a key hormone to help your bones, heart, reproduction, and more.",
        "“Low testosterone levels can be found in postmenopausal women,” says Joseph E. Barrera, MD, an endocrinologist and associate medical director at Providence Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo, California. “But unlike [estrogen], testosterone levels decline after menopause at a slower rate.”",
        "In other words, testosterone falls slowly over time. But it's not always your body making less. It's only active if the hormone is free in your bloodstream. That means it's not attached to other proteins like sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG)."
