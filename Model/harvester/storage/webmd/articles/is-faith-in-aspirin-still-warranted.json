        "Almost 30 million Americans take aspirin to prevent a first cardiovascular event (“primary prevention”), and nearly 40% of those over 50 , around 49 million people, are taking aspirin either for primary prevention or for secondary prevention after they’ve had a stroke or a heart attack .",

        "This recommendation was made after weighing the benefit of aspirin use in primary prevention against the risk of bleeding in the brain and the digestive tract. The results of three major clinical trials published in 2018 had a major influence on the guideline, said cardiologist John W. McEvoy, MBBCh, one of the guideline’s co-authors and a professor of preventive cardiology at the National University of Ireland in Galway."
