        "An early-stage HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer is always a shock, but today’s treatment options should give you hope. Over the past 2 decades, advances in medicine have brought us new, effective therapies. About one in five people with breast cancer have the HER2+ subtype. If your breast cancer is of the HER2+ subtype, your tumor has high levels of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 plays a role in the growth of cancer cells, which is why HER2+ breast cancer tends to be aggressive."

Neoadjuvant: Refers to treatment given before surgery. The goal is to shrink the tumor before removing it. Adjuvant: Refers to treatment given after surgery. The goal is to destroy cancer cells that might remain in the body. Targeted therapy: Medication that blocks the growth of specific cancer cells. It interferes with molecules that help them grow and survive. Chemotherapy: Drugs that destroy cancer cells. Endocrine therapy: Medications that lower estrogen levels or block the actions of estrogen. Biologic: A cancer medicine made from a living organism or the products of a living organism, such as proteins, sugars, or even cells and tissues."

Less common: surgery, followed by adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and HER2-directed therapy. Some people, especially those with small tumors, will take this strategy. Hormone-driven.
