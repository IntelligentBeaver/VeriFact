        "“She decided to get up and try walking without her walker and braces,” Johnson writes in the post. “My hero is not someone older than me it's my 6 year old princess.”",

        "“The happiness and pride the little girl shows while walking is wonderful to see,” says WebMD Senior Medical Director Arefa Cassoobhoy, MD. “Her story points to the importance of taking early action to maximize a child's ability to do everyday things and be independent. Children with CP often need a holistic approach to succeed with not only walking, talking, and eating, but also their academic, social, and emotional growth. Here we are seeing the benefits of a supportive family engaged with therapists and other medical professionals.”"
