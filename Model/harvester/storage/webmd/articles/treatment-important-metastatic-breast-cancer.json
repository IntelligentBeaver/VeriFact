        "About 1 in 3 new cancers in women are breast cancer, making it a common type of cancer. But women's experiences -- their treatment, outcomes, and survival rates -- vary greatly depending on their race and ethnicity. White women are more likely than those in any other racial or ethnic group in the U.S. to get breast cancer. But Black women are most likely to die of breast cancer. White women have the next-highest number of deaths from breast cancer, then Native American/Alaska Native women, Hispanic women, and Asian/Pacific Island women. The reasons for these major differences are many and complicated. Systemic racism that puts people of color at higher risk for low socioeconomic status and restricts access to care drives many of these health imbalances. Individual women can't control most of these causes. But that doesn't mean you can't take charge of your care. Women of any color or background can take steps to make sure they get the best possible care as soon as possible. What's most important is that you get treatment."

        "Like many cancers, breast cancer is easier to treat -- and maybe even cure -- the earlier doctors catch it. But many women of color tend to get diagnosed at more advanced stages. In a study of more than 450,000 women with breast cancer, half the non-Hispanic white women had gotten their diagnosis at stage I. Among white Hispanic women, 40% had a diagnosis at stage I. Only 37% of Black women got a diagnosis that early. As for Asian American women, stage I diagnoses varied. More than half of Japanese- and Chinese-American women caught their cancer at stage I. About 40%-45% of South Asian women and women from other parts of Asia got stage I diagnoses. Getting routine mammograms – images of the tissue inside your breasts – increases your chances cancer will be found early. Some studies say that routine, on-schedule mammograms slash the risk of death from breast cancer within 20 years of diagnosis by almost half. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends all women get a mammogram every other year from ages 50 to 74. Your gynecologist or primary care doctor may recommend them more often. The American Cancer Society says women should get mammograms every year starting at age 45 and may then cut down to every 2 years at age 55.  The ACS also says women 40-44 and 55 and older should have the choice to get mammograms every year if they want to."

        "Even with routine mammograms, women can still get diagnosed with more advanced cancers. If you do, it’s important to start treatment right away. Several studies show that there seem to be longer delays between an abnormal mammogram and breast cancer diagnosis for African American and Hispanic women compared to non-Hispanic white women. The same is true of the lag between diagnosis and the start of treatment. These delays are due, at least in part, to racial and ethnic differences in access to care that are beyond any individual’s control. Getting a diagnosis and starting treatment as soon as possible may affect how well your treatment works. To help you avoid these delays, you might have to speak up and advocate for yourself. Here’s how: Be on the lookout for test results. Ask the technician at your mammogram when you should expect the results. It should happen within 2 weeks. Keep an eye out for them. If it takes much longer than the tech said it would, call the office and ask about your results."

That means medicines that fight cancer throughout your entire body, rather than surgery or radiation that target cancer in a specific area. (Though in some cases, doctors also use radiation and surgery in metastatic breast cancer.) Here’s an overview of the systemic treatments for breast cancer. You might get one or more of them: The female hormones estrogen and progesterone help some breast cancer cells grow. These cancers are hormone-receptor positive. Some drugs fight these cancers by plugging into special receptors on the breast cancer cells. These drugs block these receptors so that the hormones can’t attach to them. Other drugs help reduce estrogen production in the body. These drugs are only beneficial for people who have hormone receptor-positive cancers. Targeted therapy. This is used in many different types of cancer . Targeted therapy is directed at specific proteins on cancer cells that help them grow and spread. By shutting down or weakening these proteins, the drugs can stop the progress of the cancer. Many different proteins can drive breast cancers. The most common target for these drugs is HER2. Whether you get a targeted drug depends on what’s helping your breast cancer cells grow. Immunotherapy. This also is used to treat many kinds of cancer. Immunotherapy helps your body’s immune system recognize cancer cells and attack them. The type used in breast cancer blocks a protein on T cells in your immune system that keeps them from attacking cancer cells. You may get this drug along with chemotherapy if you have triple-negative breast cancer. That means the cancer doesn’t have the receptors for either of the hormones (progesterone and estrogen) that play a role in breast cancer or HER2 proteins, which targeted breast cancer drugs fight. Chemotherapy. This includes many drugs that can reach and kill cancer cells throughout your entire body. You get the drugs in a pill or through a vein in your arm."
