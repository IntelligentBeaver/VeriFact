        "Hiccups that don't go away after 48 hours can persist but after a month, they're called intractable. Also called intractable sigultus, the word means \"gasp\" or \"sob\" in Latin. And if your hiccups don't stop, it can be hard to talk, sleep, eat, or drink. In serious cases, intractable hiccups can cause weight loss, fatigue, anxiety, and depression .",
        "We all get hiccups once in a while. Usually hiccups last for a few minutes, then go away. Your diaphragm can twitch and rhythmically jerk to hiccup. If your hiccups go on for longer than 48 hours, talk to your doctor. These “persistent” or “protracted” hiccups could be a sign of a health problem.",
        "But in very rare cases, your hiccups become chronic, lasting longer than a month. The longest recorded case of intractable hiccups continued for 60 years. Intractable hiccups are very rare — happening in about 1 in 100,000 people. About 4,000 people go to the hospital for hiccups each year in the U.S.",
        "And about 91% of people who have intractable hiccups are men. Having hiccups for a long time can exhaust you. They can disrupt your sleeping and eating patterns, too. Intractable hiccups may also cause irregular heartbeat and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Find out the causes, treatments, and medications for intractable hiccups."
