        "When the CDC announced its recommendation in September that all people ages 6 months and older get the new seasonal shot, the agency noted that 600 children had died from COVID-19 since May, adding that the risks of severe complications, like a widely publicized heart problem, were much more common due to getting COVID-19 itself, compared to getting vaccinated.",

In prior years of the pandemic, parents often got their children vaccinated against COVID-19 at pop-up clinics, many of which set up in the parking lots of schools. But this year, those pop-up clinics are scarce. This is the first vaccination campaign without the resources of a declared federal health emergency, which ended in May."
