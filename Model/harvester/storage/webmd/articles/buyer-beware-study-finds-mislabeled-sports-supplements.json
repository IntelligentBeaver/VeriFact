        "July 21, 2023 – A new analysis of dietary supplements that claim to enhance sports performance or help with weight loss found that most didn’t contain the ingredient amounts listed on the label, and some contained substances banned by the FDA.",
        "In this latest study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open , 12% of products analyzed contained an FDA-banned substance, and 89% of the supplements analyzed did not accurately list product ingredients. The study specifically looked at 57 different sports enhancement supplements, most of which claimed to have stimulant and metabolic benefits.",
        "The 57 different supplements contained at least one of the following plant-derived ingredients: Rauwolfia vomitoria , methylliberine, halostachine, octopamine, or turkesterone.",
        "All the supplements were purchased online during 2021 and 2022. The claims on the labels ranged from fat burner, thermogenic, preworkout, metabolism optimization, muscle growth, energy, and “ testosterone anabolic support.”",
        "Researchers found that 23 of the 57 products did not contain a detectable amount of an ingredient listed on the label. In products where the labeled ingredients could be detected, the actual amount varied widely from what was listed on the label, from 0.02% to 334%. Just 11% of products studied contained within 10% of the actual listed amount."
