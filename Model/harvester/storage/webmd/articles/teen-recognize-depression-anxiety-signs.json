        "Mood and behavior changes are a normal part of adolescent development, so it can be tricky to know what’s part of that process and what’s out of the ordinary and worrisome. Some parts of your kid’s brain mature before other parts. The amygdala — the part of the brain that controls immediate, emotion-based reactions — develops before their prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is in charge of reason, attention, planning, and working memory, as well as social behavior and emotional regulation. Your brain doesn’t fully develop this part of the brain until your mid- to late-20s. This means that in the years between childhood and adulthood, your teen is more likely to: Act impulsively Misread or misunderstand social cues and emotions Engage in dangerous or risky behavior and get into accidents Get involved in fights"

Worry, stress, and nervousness are all under the umbrella of anxiety, and sometimes they work in positive ways, acting as motivation to get tasks done. But sometimes anxiety symptoms persist, even after a stress or worry ends. This type of anxiety makes everyday life harder. Anxiety is a common issue in teens. Its symptoms can show up in different ways, depending on your teen’s personality and life circumstances. But there are certain themes. Anxiety can look like: Recurring fears and worries about routine parts of everyday life Irritability Trouble concentrating Extreme self-consciousness Extra sensitivity to criticism Withdrawal from social activity (not just family activities) Inability to leave the house Avoidance of difficult or new situations Drop in grades or school refusal Repeated reassurance-seeking Your teen may also feel physical effects of anxiety. Pay attention if you hear them talking about symptoms such as: Racing heartbeat Stomachaches Sweaty palms Problems sleeping Muscle tension or sore muscles Headaches Startling easily Blushing often Hyperventilating (rapid breathing or a feeling of breathlessness) Sweating"

        "It’s not uncommon for teens with anxiety to have panic attacks, which are sudden bouts of intense physical symptoms like hyperventilating, racing heartbeat, nausea , tightness in the chest, and dizziness or lightheadedness. Teens aren’t immune to stress. Pressures in school, sports, other activities, and in their social spheres are a big part of their life and can also feel bigger than they would to an adult brain. Anxiety and stress have some overlapping symptoms. They both affect your mind and your body with symptoms such as: Excessive worry Uneasiness Tension Headaches or body pain High blood pressure Loss of sleep But stress usually has an identifiable cause, like a big test or a fight with a friend. Stress symptoms tend to get better once the problem is resolved. Stress can also be a motivator to get work done on time, for example. Anxiety is more constant and gets in the way of daily activities. Talk to your teen about the importance of stress-relief practices such as: Journaling Regular exercise A consistent sleep routine Relaxation practices such as meditation or deep-breathing exercises"

According to recent data from the CDC, 4 in 10 teens had persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, while 2 in 10 seriously considered attempting suicide. Depression is more than just feeling sad or having a bad day — it’s a deep, lasting sense of unhappiness, hopelessness, or emptiness that doesn’t go away. It can change the way you think, feel, and act. In teens, this can look like: Crying spells for no reason Changes in appetite such as eating less and losing weight or craving foods and gaining weight Rage or intense frustration over small matters Annoyed mood most of the time Loss of interest in most activities, even ones they used to enjoy Low self-esteem that comes out as negative talk about themselves Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Fixation on mistakes or failures A need for constant reassurance Trouble remembering things Trouble concentrating or making decisions Slower body movements Sleeping too much (more than typical teen sleeping-in behavior)"

        "Teens with depression may also stop taking care of their appearance and hygiene. You may notice them wearing the same clothes day after day, and not bathing or shaving. They may wallow in their room for hours, often in bed. You may also start to notice friendships start to fade away and their connections dwindle. Physically, they may have: Headaches Stomachaches Body aches Slowed speech At school, they may visit the school nurse more often. Sometimes the emptiness and numb feeling that depression causes creates a desire to feel something, even if that thing is pain. Some teens with depression engage in self-harm behaviors such as: Cutting their skin with sharp objects Head-banging Burning themselves Pulling their hair Scratching of the skin to the point of drawing blood Punching themselves Inserting objects into body openings Drinking harmful substances such as bleach or detergent Attempt to break their bones on purpose Most self-harm comes from a temporary need to escape or distract, not a wish to die. But it’s concerning behavior you should address and treat alongside a doctor. Your child’s doctor or mental health professional can help you and your teen with strategies to stay safe. Teenagers who are anxious are also more likely to use recreational drugs as another way to manage discomfort. Most commonly, teens turn to marijuana and alcohol as self-medication. But although these substances may create a temporary relief from certain feelings, they’re not healthy ways to cope. The underlying issue doesn’t go away, and often, your teen becomes dependent on the substance, which creates more problems in the future."
