It’s painless, and you can ask for medicine to help you feel calmer if an enclosed space makes you anxious. The technician who does the test watches you from another room, and you should be able to talk with them over a microphone in the machine if you need to. Doctors don’t use MRI as commonly as ultrasound to diagnose DVT.",

Before the test, you lie down on an X-ray table, and a member of your care team places a needle called an IV into a vein in your foot or ankle. Then they inject dye, which allows the deep veins in your leg or hip to stand out in X-ray images."
