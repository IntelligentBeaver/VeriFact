        "Doreen Zetterlund got the shock of a lifetime back in 2015. A lump in her neck that she thought was a stubborn muscle spasm turned out to be something a lot more serious and incurable. An MRI showed the lump was a swollen lymph node. More tests found swollen nodes all over her body. The Los Angeles resident was urged to see an oncologist as soon as she could. She was later diagnosed with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and eventually with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). SLL is the same disease as CLL. Both are slow-growing cancers that affect your white blood cells called B-lymphocytes. When abnormal cells are only found in the lymphatic system, it’s called SLL. When they’re found in large numbers in the bloodstream and bone marrow, it’s called CLL. These abnormal cells don’t work the way they should, which can lead to serious infections and bleeding. Zetterlund works in the entertainment industry and is now in her 60s. Her second act in life took her into the unknown world of science – far from her comfort zone in the world of the arts."

        "Zetterlund recalls the moment when she first heard the news: “I was sitting in the oncologist’s office and he’s like blah, blah, blah … leukemia… blah, blah, blah … lymphoma.”  Then the cancer doctor said, “You have the ‘good’ kind of cancer,” she recalled. “Go live your life and don’t worry about it; we’re not going to do anything about it.” He handed her a pamphlet about her cancer and asked, “Do you have any questions?” She said, “I don’t even know what this is. I don’t know what questions to ask!” “All I ever heard about cancer is you catch it early and get it out of you. So for someone to say, ‘we’re just going to watch it’ – that’s a hard concept.” Gwen Nichols, MD, chief medical officer of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, says, “Doctors call it ‘watch and wait.’”  But for many people, it really is “watch and worry.\" But it’s standard of care if your cancer isn’t widespread. Your doctor will monitor you for signs that your cancer is getting worse with physical exams, lab tests, and sometimes scans.  If your cancer shows signs of progression, your doctor probably will suggest treatment then. “You don’t want therapy if you don’t need it right now,” Nichols says."

        "Zetterlund took a deep dive into all things CLL – from new medical terminology to cutting-edge medicines and everything in between. She learned that modern treatments are effective at putting the cancer into remission and clinical trials are researching even newer medicines. She also found out that many people stay in “watch and wait” for months, years, or sometimes even the rest of their lives. The best way to advocate for yourself  is to educate yourself about this disease, Zetterlund says. “Then you can ask informed questions, then you can be more in charge of what you want to know,” she adds. Nichols agrees. Borrowing from the old Syms clothing store commercials, she quips that “an educated consumer is our best customer.” This is absolutely true when it comes to medicine as well, she says. Here are some steps to take: Front-load your knowledge. CLL is a slow-simmering disease. If you’re in “watch and wait” mode, now’s the time to learn as much as you can about your cancer and treatment options. You never know if and when you’ll need it. You don’t want to begin at the 11th hour, Zetterlund says. “You might not feel well, you’re rushing to get into treatment, and you won’t have time to educate yourself.”"

Zetterlund wasn’t satisfied with her first oncologist, so she “interviewed” several before finding the one who fit her best. She says she learned more and more about her disease from each appointment. She asked questions about how things would likely unfold, what her cancer markers meant, and what were likely the best treatments for her. Be picky about your information. If you just google CLL, you’re likely to find sites that push a particular treatment. When you’re looking for good, up-to-date information, go to trusted sources.
