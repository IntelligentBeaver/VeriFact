        "The main difference is how deep the cancer has grown into the bladder. Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) stays in the inner layers. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) means cancer cells have grown deeper,  into the muscle layer. MIBC is more likely to spread to other parts of the body and is often harder to treat than NMIBC.",
