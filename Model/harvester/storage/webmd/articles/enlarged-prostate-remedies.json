        "An enlarged prostate is a condition that most commonly affects men over 50, but it can begin once you reach your 30s. This condition, often called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, is non-cancerous but can sometimes have similar symptoms to prostate cancer . BPH is believed to be the result of natural cell growth and hormone changes from testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.",
        "The prostate is a significant organ in the male reproductive system because it helps produce fluid for semen. Beginning around age 25, the prostate begins a natural growth period that continues throughout a man's life.",
        "Nearly all men experience prostate growth, with the majority developing BPH as they age. Common symptoms of an enlarged prostate include frequent and urgent urination, troubles with urine stream, incontinence and dribbling, pain after urination, and urine remaining in the bladder.",
        "About 50 percent of men in their 50s and 60s show symptoms that can make daily life frustrating, as do 90 percent of men 80 and older. Check in with your doctor if you are concerned about any urinary changes. This can help to rule out other issues and help you return to more comfortable trips to the bathroom."
