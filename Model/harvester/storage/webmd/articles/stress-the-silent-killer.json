        "Perhaps one of the greatest life lessons is learning how to manage the silent killer: stress. Chronic stress has been linked to many illnesses including depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, and (surprise, surprise) fibromyalgia. Have you noticed how stress affects your chronic illness?",
        "For me, where there’s increased stress, there’s likely a fibromyalgia flare looming. Not only can stress trigger a flare, but it can worsen existing symptoms including pain, fatigue, and sleep disorders. The link between stress and fibromyalgia truly feels like you’re being kicked while you’re down, and oftentimes I’m unsure which came first.",
        "Living with a chronic illness can cause many stressors in your life, financially, emotionally, mentally, and physically. And when stress only exacerbates your chronic illness, you’re stuck in a vicious cycle. There’s no escaping chronic illness or stress in life, the only option is learning how to tame these beasts. So what does managing stress mean?",
        "Managing stress takes a conscious and everyday effort, as most healthy habits need to be built. To lessen the impact of stress on fibromyalgia, make reducing stress a part of your daily routine- even on the days you don’t want to! Here are some of the ways I began introducing stress management into my daily life:"
