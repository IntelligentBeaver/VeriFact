Studies have shown that a light, supervised exercise routine is an important piece of PAH treatment. Pulmonary rehabilitation can help you work up to a more active lifestyle . It’s a program that can help you manage your condition, build up your stamina, and handle breathlessness when it happens. It’s not a substitute for medicine and other treatment, but it can help you breathe better and stay healthy."

Other programs also offer group or one-on-one sessions to teach you better ways to breathe when you’re active or during stressful times. You might learn how to feel more in control of your breath and other ways to manage PAH symptoms.
