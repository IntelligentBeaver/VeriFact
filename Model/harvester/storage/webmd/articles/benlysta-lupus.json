        "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) , more commonly known as lupus, is an autoimmune disorder , which means that a person’s immune system attacks the healthy cells in their body. In people with lupus, the immune system may attack many different parts of the body, including the skin, the joints, and certain organs. This causes swelling (inflammation) that can lead to different symptoms depending on which part of the body is affected.",
        "Many people with lupus feel very tired and may have headaches and low fevers. Most people also have symptoms related to their skin and hair, such as sensitivity to sunlight, a butterfly-shaped rash on the face, sores in the mouth or nose, or hair loss. Some people may experience pain in their joints, pain in the chest while taking a deep breath, or swelling in the hands, feet, and around the eyes. Over time, lupus can cause damage to the heart or kidneys, which can increase the risk for heart and kidney disease."

        "Some people with lupus may have relatively mild symptoms whereas others may have very severe symptoms. For many people, symptoms will change over time. Many people will have flare-ups when symptoms become much worse for weeks or months. Some people may have periods of remission when their symptoms go away for some length of time. If a person is experiencing lupus symptoms, their disease is considered active at that time.",
        "The first step to treating lupus is to manage symptoms through lifestyle changes, exercise, diet, and certain medicines. But the key to treating lupus over time is to use medicines that slow down the attacks from the immune system. Oral corticosteroids (such as prednisone ) are commonly used for this purpose. Many people also take a medicine that was originally used to treat malaria, such as hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). There are also many medicines that limit the activity of the entire immune system (immunosuppressants), such as azathioprine , methotrexate , and mycophenolate (Cellcept).",
        "Benlysta is a different type of medicine called a biologic. Belimumab, the active ingredient in Benlysta, targets a specific type of cell in the immune system that plays a major role in lupus called the B cell. Benlysta blocks a substance called B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) from binding to B cells, which reduces the number of B cells in the body. This can help to reduce swelling and symptoms in people with lupus."
