        "Mirdametinib is a medicine that helps people with NF1 who have PN, which are tumors that can't be fully removed by surgery. Gomekli works by blocking specific enzymes in the body called mitogen-activated kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1 and MEK2). These enzymes send signals that help tumors grow. By stopping these signals, Gomekli slows tumor growth and can shrink tumors. Since surgery isn’t always an option (because tumors grow around important body parts like nerves and organs), Gomekli gives people another way to manage their condition​."

        "The ReNeu study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of Gomekli in 111 people 2 years old and older with NF1 with PN who had tumors that made them uncomfortable or affected their movement and that could not be removed by surgery. People in the study took Gomekli twice a day for 21 days, followed by seven days off, in repeating 28-day cycles. The dose of Gomekli was based on height and body weight. People continued treatment for up to 24 cycles or until their disease worsened or they had side effects that required stopping treatment. To measure effectiveness, people in the study received MRI scans to track tumor size.",

The median (middle) age of adults was 35 (and ranged from 18 to 69); 64% were female, 85% were White, 9% were Black or African American, 3.4% were Asian, 3.4% were other races; and 1.7% were Hispanic or Latino. The median age of children was 10 (and ranged from 2 to 17); 54% were female; 66% were White, 20% were Black or African American, 9% were other races, 3.6% were Asian, 1.8% were Native American or Alaska Native; and 14% were Hispanic or Latino. More than half of the people in the study had progressive PN (tumors that have demonstrated continuous growth) at the start of the study (adults, 53%; children, 62%) and some had previously received treatment with a MEK inhibitor (adults, 7%; children, 11%). Prior surgery was reported in 69% of adults and 36% of children. People in the study commonly had other complications, including pain (adults, 90%; children, 70%), disfigurement or major deformity (adults, 52%; children, 50%), and problems with movement and coordination (adults, 40%; children, 27%)."
