        "Changes in your skin. Have your doctor look at unusual or new moles, bumps, or marks on your body to be sure skin cancer isn’t lurking. Your skin can also provide clues to other kinds of cancers. If you notice skin changes such as darkening, a yellow or red hue, itching, increased hair growth, or an unexplained rash, it could be a sign of liver, ovarian, or kidney cancer or lymphoma.",

Other preventable causes include diets low in fruits and vegetables or high in processed meat, and infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). About 4 in 10 cancers are caused by such preventable factors. Other risk factors for cancer are things you can't change, such as your age or your genes.
