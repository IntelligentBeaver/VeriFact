        "Scalp psoriasis is a common skin disorder. It may look different on different skin tones. If you're light- to medium-skinned, it often shows up as raised, reddish, or salmon-colored patches with white scales. On darker skin, the patches may be purple and the scales gray. It can be a single patch or several and can even affect your entire scalp. It can also spread to your forehead, the back of your neck, and behind and inside your ears.",
        "You can't catch scalp psoriasis from another person. As with other types of psoriasis , we don't know what causes it. Doctors believe it comes from something wrong with your immune system that causes skin cells to grow too quickly and build up into patches. You may be more likely to get scalp psoriasis if it runs in your family.",

        "About half of the estimated 7.5 million Americans with psoriasis — which can affect any skin surface — have it on their scalp. Sometimes, the scalp is the only place they have it, but that's uncommon."
