In MF, the JAKs become overactive and cause scar tissue to form in the bone marrow, which can lead to less blood cells being formed. Ojjaara stops the overactive JAKs and also stops a protein called activin A receptor type 1 (ACVR1) in your liver cells, which increases the number of red blood cells in your body."
