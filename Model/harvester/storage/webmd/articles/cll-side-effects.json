        "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a cancer of the bone marrow, which produces blood cells. If you have CLL, your bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. There is no cure for CLL, but there is treatment. The goal of CLL treatment is to slow down the growth of the cancer cells so they stop producing too many lymphocytes, and then to keep you in that state for as long as possible. While the treatments kill the cancer cells, they also kill healthy cells, which is why you may have some side effects."

        "The side effects that you might have depend on the type of CLL treatment you get. Most often, you'll start out on a targeted or monoclonal antibody therapy. They have similar side effects to chemotherapy but are usually milder. Sometimes, you may get chemotherapy or others medicines combined with corticosteroids, like prednisone. The side effects can involve many parts of your body, but most often they affect the lining of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract like your: Mouth Throat Stomach Intestines (gut) Some of the side effects — like anemia or repeated infections — happen because the therapy can cause low levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Aside from anemia and a weakened immune system, these are the most common side effects: Diarrhea or constipation Easy bruising, higher risk of bleeding Extreme fatigue Hair loss Rash Heartburn, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite Infections Neuropathy, a numb or tingling feeling in your hands and feet Sores in your mouth (mucositis)"

        "Some side effects are worse than others, but there are some steps you can take to help manage them. First, you can start by being prepared. For example, there are medications to help manage nausea or constipation. Staying as hydrated as possible can help lessen several side effects, too. This means drinking eight to 10 glasses of liquids a day (soup counts, too!). If you’re nauseated, small sips throughout the day add up fast. Keep a journal or log about your treatment and side effects. This will be helpful for you and your cancer care team. Note the type of chemotherapy you have and when. Then write down if and when the side effects begin and how they affect you. Don’t forget to make note of when they go away or lessen — if they do. Here are some more tips for you to try. When to call your doctor: If your fatigue is affecting how you function and you can’t do your regular activities."
