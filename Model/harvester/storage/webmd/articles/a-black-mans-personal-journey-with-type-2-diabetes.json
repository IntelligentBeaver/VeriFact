        "2005 was one of the most challenging years of my life. I was 54 years old at the time, and it was the year I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. As a Black man with Caribbean roots who ran 6 to 8 miles a day in my teens, 20s, and 30s – but unfortunately in my 40s, I stopped running and exercising like I used to – I became overweight.",
        "I believe one of the many reasons I became overweight was because of my love affair with sugar. In my youth, growing up in the Roxbury section of Boston, I enjoyed what we called the “penny candy store.” These stores were usually within walking distance of your home and had every candy you could imagine – for a penny, or a cheap price.",
        "Even when I ran 6 to 8 miles a day, I enjoyed my sugar fix, I loved candy like Sugar Daddies, Sugar Babies, sugary drinks, root beer sodas, coconut macaroons, sweet tea, sweet potato pies, and other sweets that were no good for me. The fact is, I thought when I exercised, it really didn’t make a difference."

        "Then one day, after drinking three large, sugar-ladened sweet teas in 2005, it all caught up with me. In spite of having generally a decent diet of eating lots of vegetables, limited meats, and plenty of grains, little did I know, my blood sugar levels were hitting the roof. I didn’t feel well, I felt like I was about to faint. I had not eaten all day, thinking it could be an upset stomach. I went for a doctor’s visit. My doctor, who is not a person of color, took a urine sample, pricked my finger, and informed me that my blood sugar level was at 500.",
        "He indicated at that time that I could have prediabetes or diabetes. I didn’t know at the time what diabetes was or what was the cause. Like so many people who learn that they have diabetes, I was petrified. My doctor, who was an internal medicine doctor and not an endocrinologist, urged me to come back to his office in a week. He asked me not to eat any candy, not to drink any sodas, and to limit the amount of bread I consumed, so he could again test my fasting blood sugar levels and A1c."

He placed me on insulin and gave me a 2-minute explanation about diabetes. Then, he gave me what I consider the worst misinformation that a doctor could give to someone newly diagnosed with diabetes. He told me I would have to use insulin for life, and that diabetes is irreversible. He urged me to take my insulin as prescribed, limit my sugar and carbohydrates, and exercise. He also urged me to read about diabetes. When I asked more questions about diabetes and what foods I should or shouldn’t eat, he gave me insensitive body and verbal cues that suggested he was rushed and wanted to go to the next patient.",
