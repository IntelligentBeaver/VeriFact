        "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious mental health condition that affects millions of people. Several types of medications can treat it. But if you’ve tried one or more antidepressants and still have symptoms, you may not know what to try next. Your doctor can help you decide how to move forward. Many things go into that choice, including which treatments you’ve tried before, how serious your symptoms are, and your overall health. Before we get into cutting-edge treatments for depression, here’s a breakdown of the first or second type of antidepressant your doctor might prescribe (or that you’ve already tried): Citalopram (Celexa) Escitalopram (Lexapro) Fluoxetine (prozac) Fluvoxamine (Luvox, Luvox CR) Paroxetine (Paxil) Sertraline (Zoloft) Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) Duloxetine (Cymbalta) Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, Khedezla) Levomilnacipran (Fetzima) Venlafaxine (Effexor) Atypical antidepressants Bupropion (Wellbutrin) Mirtazapine (Remeron) Trazodone (Desyrel) All these target the brain chemicals serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine. These brain chemicals affect mood and emotions."

        "If you have major depressive disorder, certain areas of your brain may be underactive. Treatments that target NMDA receptors help strengthen connections between those brain cells and increase the release of glutamate, a brain chemical that affects mood, memory, and thinking. Since your brain and spinal cord have many glutamate receptors, NMDA-targeting drugs affect a large number of nerve cells at once. Experts believe this surge in connectivity between nerve cells, or neurons, is what helps ease depression so fast, sometimes within hours of treatment. Conventional antidepressants also boost brain connections. But the effects are milder and take longer than drugs that act on glutamate."

        "This is the first prescription antidepressant you take by mouth that targets NMDA. Auvelity is a pill you take every day. It's approved for adults with major depressive disorder. Early studies show your symptoms may improve in as little as one to two weeks, which suggests that Auvelity works much faster than traditional antidepressants. You shouldn't expect it to work as quickly as esketamine or ketamine. Each extended-release pill contains 45 milligrams of dextromethorphan and 105 milligrams of bupropion. Here's more about how the two main ingredients work to treat depression: Dextromethorphan. This medication is commonly used as a cough suppressant, but it’s also an NMDA receptor antagonist that can boost glutamate and a sigma-1 receptor agonist that can raise serotonin levels. Bupropion. This is a type of antidepressant known as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). But it also blocks CYP2D6. That’s a chemical in your body that quickly breaks down drugs, including dextromethorphan. Some people take bupropion alone to treat depression. But in Auvelity, the antidepressant effects mainly come from how dextromethorphan acts in the body. Bupropion is mostly there to keep dextromethorphan in your bloodstream longer. Dosing schedule. When you start taking Auvelity, you’ll typically take one pill a day for the first three days. At some point, your doctor will probably have you take it twice a day, leaving at least eight hours between doses. Never take more than two pills within 24 hours."

But you may feel groggy for a while, so you’ll need someone to drive you home afterward. Esketamine is generally considered safe. But it's not recommended for people who: Have an aneurysm (a weak, bulging spot in a blood vessel, usually an artery) Have arteriovenous malformation (an abnormal clump of blood vessels) Have had a stroke, particularly one that caused bleeding in your brain Are pregnant Talk to your doctor if you have high blood pressure, heart disease, or any other disease of your heart or blood vessels. They'll let you know if esketamine is a safe choice for you.",

        "This is the first prescription antidepressant you take by mouth that targets NMDA. Auvelity is a pill you take every day. It's approved for adults with major depressive disorder. Early studies show your symptoms may improve in as little as one to two weeks, which suggests that Auvelity works much faster than traditional antidepressants. You shouldn't expect it to work as quickly as esketamine or ketamine. Each extended-release pill contains 45 milligrams of dextromethorphan and 105 milligrams of bupropion. Here's more about how the two main ingredients work to treat depression: Dextromethorphan. This medication is commonly used as a cough suppressant, but it’s also an NMDA receptor antagonist that can boost glutamate and a sigma-1 receptor agonist that can raise serotonin levels. Bupropion. This is a type of antidepressant known as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). But it also blocks CYP2D6. That’s a chemical in your body that quickly breaks down drugs, including dextromethorphan. Some people take bupropion alone to treat depression. But in Auvelity, the antidepressant effects mainly come from how dextromethorphan acts in the body. Bupropion is mostly there to keep dextromethorphan in your bloodstream longer. Dosing schedule. When you start taking Auvelity, you’ll typically take one pill a day for the first three days. At some point, your doctor will probably have you take it twice a day, leaving at least eight hours between doses. Never take more than two pills within 24 hours."
