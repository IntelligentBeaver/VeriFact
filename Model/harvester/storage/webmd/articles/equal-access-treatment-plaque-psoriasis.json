        "Once you have a psoriasis diagnosis, you and your doctor will work together to figure out the best treatment options.

This can be an issue with a treatment like light therapy, which calls for visits to the dermatologist two or three times a week. Meanwhile, if you’re a person of color in the U.S., finding a dermatologist of the same race or ethnicity can also be a challenge. While dermatologists of all backgrounds are qualified to treat skin of color, you may prefer care from a doctor who looks like you. In one study, Black people who visited skin-of-color clinics said dermatologists there had better training to address their concerns. They also felt the doctors showed them more respect and dignity and were more trustworthy. Reena Ruparelia is a Toronto-based psoriasis advocate who has lived with the condition for nearly 30 years. She’s South Asian and has often visited older, white male dermatologists. Ruparelia says she felt intimidated by these doctors and uncomfortable asking questions. Today, her dermatologist is of the same background and gender."
