        "A blighted ovum occurs when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus but doesn't form an embryo. It is also referred to as an anembryonic (no embryo) pregnancy and is a leading cause of early pregnancy failure or miscarriage. Often it occurs so early that you don't even know you are pregnant.",
        "A blighted ovum causes about 1 out of 2 miscarriages in the first trimester of pregnancy . A miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own within the first 20 weeks.",
        "When a woman becomes pregnant, the fertilized egg attaches to the uterine wall. At about five to six weeks of pregnancy, an embryo should be present. At about this time, the gestational sac (where the fetus grows) is about 18 millimeters wide. With a blighted ovum, the pregnancy sac forms and grows, but the embryo does not form. That's why a blighted ovum is also called an anembryonic pregnancy.",
        "\"When an ultrasound is performed after four to five weeks’ gestational age, measured from the first day of the last menstrual period, a fluid-filled sac can be seen within the uterine cavity, but no embryo is present,\" says Henry Dorn, MD, an obstetrics & gynecology specialist practicing in High Point, NC. A definite diagnosis can usually be made 11-14 days later if there's still no embryo."
