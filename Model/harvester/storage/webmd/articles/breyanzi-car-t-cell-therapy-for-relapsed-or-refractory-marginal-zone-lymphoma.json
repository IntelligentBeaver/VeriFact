        "Breyanzi (lisocabtagene maraleucel) is a type of personalized cancer treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, which uses your modified T cells (white blood cells that help protect you from illness) to fight cancer. The FDA has approved Breyanzi for adults with a certain type of blood cancer known as marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) that has come back (relapsed) or hasn't responded well to two or more previous therapies (refractory).",
        "MZL is a rare slow-growing type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) – a form of blood cancer. It arises from B cells or B lymphocytes (another type of white blood cells) found in the marginal zone of lymphoid tissues. MZL makes up about 7% of all NHL cases in the U.S., often affecting adults around 67 years old. It occurs when white blood cells gather and form lumps in the lymph nodes or other organs. Although initial treatment for the disease can help achieve remission, relapses are common and may happen often over several years. In a small number of cases, MZL can transform into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a more aggressive form of the disease."
