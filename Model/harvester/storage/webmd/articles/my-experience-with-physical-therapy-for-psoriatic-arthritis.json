        "One of the most challenging yet most helpful treatments I’ve ever done for my psoriatic arthritis is going to physical therapy. Some days, it was really difficult to stick with and make consistent progress. There were days where I just hurt so bad and wanted nothing to do with stretches or exercise. It was definitely a delicate balance of pushing myself and listening to my body. Going to physical therapy completely changed my quality of life for the better overall.",
        "The Referral",
        "After a year of treatment for my psoriatic arthritis, I was still really struggling to walk farther than the mailbox because of all the muscle I’d lost during the onset of the illness. One day, my rheumatologist brought up the idea of prescribing me physical therapy if I was interested. I was immediately so excited to try something else and have a professional show me how to actually exercise without flaring so badly after. After months of insurance mix-ups and waiting, I finally got approved to go. I found one close to where I lived with good reviews and made the initial appointment."

We began my initial appointment with a verbal history of why I was there, what I was struggling with the most, what hurt the most, and what kind of work I did, before moving into the physical assessment. After explaining about my early onset psoriatic arthritis and the falls I’d experienced over the previous year and a half, the physical therapist expressed concern and validated these issues, reassuring me that they would assess everything and then make a plan to address any problems.",

Then we talked about what they were seeing and why that would explain certain issues I was having."

        "They educated me about what was happening inside my joints and muscles, and what problems to be on the lookout for in the future. They determined that a lot of what was causing my issues was lack of balance, coordination, and muscle weakness. The therapist explained how strengthening my muscles would better support and protect my damaged joints in the long run.",
        "Avoiding Overdoing It",
        "One of my biggest fears with psoriatic arthritis and exercise is doing too much. Sometimes it’s so easy to accidentally overdo it and cause a painful flare-up. After speaking with them about this, the physical therapist and I decided that if I flared three times after a physical therapy session, we would back off and the reduce frequency. Thankfully, we started so slowly and gradually that this never happened.",
        "Getting Started",
        "So, I began going to physical therapy, once every week and doing it at home three times per week. After about 6 weeks of consistent physical therapy in office and at home, I could tell I was getting stronger. I noticed I could be on my feet longer and walk a little farther. Gradually, it became easier to do things like lifting a gallon of milk, making a meal, or taking my dog out for a walk!"

Some days, it was a real struggle to keep at it, especially when I was hurting so bad I just wanted to skip the stretches and exercises altogether. But it was all about finding that sweet spot between pushing myself and knowing when to take it easy. But sticking with it paid off so much. Physical therapy totally turned things around for me, and life's been way better ever since."
