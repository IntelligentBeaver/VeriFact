        "Years ago, your doctor was often the only source of information. Now, with the Internet at your fingertips, you are much more likely to be informed about your health – even before you get to the doctor.",
        "That’s a great thing and should engender a sense of empowerment and personal responsibility for your health – and your family’s.",
        "What does your doctor think about this? In a recent survey on a doctors-only discussion board on WebMD’s network, 91% of doctors said Internet health information was at least somewhat helpful for their patients.",
        "Because the “10-minute office visit” is the reality of today’s patient care, the Internet couldn’t have come at a better time. By researching your symptoms, exploring possible treatments and learning what you can do to keep yourself healthy, you can make the most of the limited time you have with your doctor."
