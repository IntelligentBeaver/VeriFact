        "If you’re in your 40s, 50s, or early 60s, you may have assumed your migraine attacks would fade away by now, like that annoying coworker who eventually finds another job. Instead, it seems to be getting worse. Hormone changes during perimenopause and menopause don’t help either. And when you’re juggling a job, family demands, and other responsibilities, checking out for days isn’t an option. So you’re left wondering: What do other women actually do to stop migraine from affecting their lives?",
        "“I always start by reminding my patients that migraine is a neurological disease that’s in their DNA and is not due to something they’re doing wrong,” says Jessica Kiarashi, MD, a neurologist at UT Southwestern Medical Center. And drops in estrogen during perimenopause and menopause can make attacks worse, says Ella Akkerman, MD, a neurologist at Virginia Spine Institute (VSI).",
        "Kiarashi, Akkerman, and Emily Kostelnik, a clinical health psychologist specializing in neurological conditions who also lives with vestibular migraine, all agree that the factors that make migraine worse are highly individual. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution. But seeing what helps other women your age can give you clues to what might work for you.",

At 49, with a very active lifestyle, she was puzzled by the migraine attacks hitting her every three to four days. “Then I had my electrolyte levels tested, and it came back that my sodium levels were low,” she says. Acting on that insight, she began adding a pinch of kosher Celtic sea salt to her spring water — once in the morning on an empty stomach and again at night before bed. “I started this routine about three months ago, and I haven’t had a migraine flare-up since.”",

        "“Stress management is essential for migraine prevention,” Akkerman says. Chronic stress lowers happy chemicals in the brain, including serotonin and dopamine, which leads to a lower pain threshold and increased neuroinflammation that triggers migraines.” She recommends using apps for meditation, relaxation, and stress management.",
        "Because of its myriad effects on the body, regular exercise can be a powerful tool for women with migraine, Akkerman says. You don’t have to train like an athlete to see results. “As little as 30 minutes of raising heart rate above 120 beats per minute three times a week can make a difference.” Gentle movement, such as walking, yoga, and stretching, helps too. “They decrease muscle tension and stress hormones that are linked to triggering migraines.”",
        "But she cautioned against pushing too hard. “Overstraining can cause injury or muscle tension which can trigger a migraine, especially if pain is located in the neck or shoulder region.” And if you notice exercise itself brings on your migraine, talk to your doctor — it could be related to dehydration, low blood sugar, or blood pressure changes.",
        "As the women in these stories prove, finding small things that help and incorporating them into your daily routine can really make a difference. “My routine isn’t perfect, but it has helped me experience fewer migraine flares and recover more quickly when they do occur,” Adriana says."
