        "Diplopia (double vision ) is a rare but disturbing condition. It happens when the images of objects before you are formed in different parts of the retinas in your two eyes. Many disorders of the eye and nervous system cause you to see two of everything. This condition can make your daily activities difficult. Prism lenses have the property of changing the direction of light rays. They can be used to make sure both your eyes form images in the same place. Prism lenses are valuable in both assessing double vision and reversing it."
