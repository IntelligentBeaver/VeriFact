        "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a condition where too much fat builds up in your liver. Unlike fatty liver caused by heavy drinking, MASLD develops because of other health reasons and used to be called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A more advanced form of MASLD, called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), happens when fat in your liver leads to inflammation and sometimes liver scarring (fibrosis). What is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)? Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer, making up about 90% of cases. Unlike secondary liver cancer – which spreads to your liver from other parts of the body – HCC starts in the liver. Other less common types of liver cancer include: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: Cancer of the bile ducts inside the liver. Hepatoblastoma: A rare liver cancer that mostly affects children younger than 3. Can fatty liver cause liver cancer? Yes, it can. While most people with fatty liver don’t get liver cancer, MASLD is now seen as one of the fastest-growing causes of HCC."

        "Here’s how it happens: When fat builds up in your liver, it can lead to chronic inflammation. Inflammation that doesn’t go away can damage liver cells and their DNA. Over time, you may get scarring that doesn’t heal (cirrhosis). Cirrhosis creates an ideal setting for liver cancer to develop. Though cirrhosis greatly increases the risk of HCC, liver cancer can also happen in people with MASLD who don’t have cirrhosis. The risk of liver cancer mostly depends on how advanced your liver disease is. Here’s what research shows: Up to 2.6% of people with MASH develop HCC each year. If you have MASLD with cirrhosis, you’re 10-30 times more likely to develop HCC than people without cirrhosis. Around 0.11% of people with MASLD without cirrhosis may get HCC each year. A growing number of people with MASLD without cirrhosis are getting liver cancer. Experts aren’t sure why. Researchers are working to find what specific factors increase the risk in these cases."

Inflammation caused by conditions like MASH make the liver more vulnerable to cancer. Here’s how MASLD can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): Excess fat cells damage or kill liver cells, a process called lipotoxicity. Damaged cells trigger inflammation, leading to MASH. MASH-related inflammation causes scar tissue to replace healthy tissue (fibrosis). The liver responds by creating new cells to repair itself. Constant cell turnover raises the risk of DNA damage, which can lead to cancer. Who’s most at risk for MASLD-related liver cancer? While cirrhosis is the main predictor of HCC, it doesn’t account for all cases. Research suggests that around 30% of people with MASLD-HCC don’t have cirrhosis, meaning liver cancer can develop before you get advanced scarring."

          "text": "If you have cirrhosis, your doctor may suggest you get a liver ultrasound every six months to check for early signs of liver cancer. They might also run liver-specific blood tests at the same time. Early detection and management can improve your chances of a good outcome if you do get liver cancer. But medical experts don’t agree on whether screenings are worth it for people without advanced liver scarring. Some research suggests people with type 2 diabetes and MASLD should be considered for regular liver screenings, even without cirrhosis, since liver cancer can develop earlier in these settings. But there aren’t clear screening guidelines for this group. Your liver is located in the upper right side of your belly, just beneath your ribs. You may not be able to see or feel signs of liver cancer until you get a big mass in it. But there are things you can do to find liver cancer before that. To diagnose liver cancer, you may get one more of the following: Blood tests. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a protein your liver makes before you're born. High levels of AFP can be a sign of liver cancer because levels should be low in adults. Imaging. Ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, or angiography can reveal swelling, masses or other abnormal changes in the liver. Liver biopsy. Your doctor may take out a small piece of liver tissue to test it for cancer cells. This usually isn’t necessary, but you might need a biopsy if other tests can't confirm a cancer diagnosis.",

        "You can start by managing the underlying causes of liver damage. For MASLD-related liver cancer, here are steps you can take to reduce your risk: Manage your weight. If you are overweight or have obesity, losing weight is one of the best ways to reduce liver fat and inflammation. Even modest weight loss can make a big impact: Losing 3%-5% of your body weight can reduce fat buildup in your liver. A 7%-10% loss can improve inflammation linked to MASH. Losing at least 10% can decrease or reverse mild scarring (fibrosis). Eat a liver-friendly diet. While there’s no specific “liver cancer diet,” a Mediterranean-style diet is widely recommended for liver and overall health. This eating plan includes a lot of plant-based foods, which can lower your risk of liver damage. Dietary factors that may protect against liver cancer include: Eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes. Limit added sugars in foods and drinks. Avoid red and processed meat, which are high in saturated fats. Use unsaturated fats like olive oil instead of butter or margarine. Eat fish and seafood a couple times a week. Drink two to three cups of coffee a day."
