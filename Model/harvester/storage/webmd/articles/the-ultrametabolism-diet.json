        "Does It Work?",
        "By ridding your diet of processed foods and refined carbs, you'll probably lose the extra weight -- as long as you're using up more calories than you're taking in. This may be hard to figure out, though, since the plan doesn’t dwell on the math.",
        "Science does support a key theme in the Ultrametabolism Diet, namely that an imbalance of proteins, carbs, and fats can lead to long-term illness. But there is no evidence that supports a one-size-fits-all diet plan that will lead to weight loss for all.",
        "Is It Good for Certain Conditions?",
        "The emphasis on complex carbs, fresh vegetables, and high-fiber foods is a time-tested recipe for heart health. Since you're preparing your own foods, you can adapt the recipes to avoid extra salt if you have high blood pressure and need to watch your sodium.",
        "Weight loss and a healthy mix of complex carbs and lean protein are also important in the prevention and treatment of diabetes. Just let your doctor know if you have diabetes and are thinking about starting a new diet plan. You may need to change your diabetes treatment plan to avoid low blood sugar .",
        "The Final Word",
        "The Ultrametabolism Diet is simple to follow, at least in theory. You're likely to have a rough time at first, if you've been eating a lot of processed foods and simple carbs. Cutting out all wheat, dairy, and eggs in the second phase might be pretty hard, as well.",
        "Hyman does a good job of outlining a healthy eating plan that helps keep the extra pounds off, favoring healthy fats, fiber, plant proteins, and lean meat. But it still may be a little restrictive for some people’s tastes.",
        "It will be easiest to stick with this diet if you like to prepare your own foods and are comfortable around the kitchen. Because of all the restrictions, eating out may be a challenge."
