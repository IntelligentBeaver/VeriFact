        "Jon D. Kaiser, MD, graduated from the State University of New York with a\ndegree in philosophy and attended medical school at the University of Texas\nMedical School in Houston. During his medical school training, he received\nhonors in Internal Medicine and Emergency Medicine. Perceiving limitations of a\npurely mechanistic approach to the treatment of disease, Kaiser began to\nexplore the fields of nutrition, natural therapies, and emotional healing\ntechniques.",
        "Kaiser trained in internal medicine at Kaiser Foundation Hospital in San\nFrancisco and began treating patients with HIV. Several years later he opened\nhis private practice, which quickly grew to capacity due to his unique and\ncomprehensive approach to HIV treatment.",
        "In 1997, Kaiser became medical director of the Jon Kaiser Wellness Center,\nwhere natural and standard medical therapies are combined in the treatment of\ncomplex medical conditions. Kaiser's goal is to teach his comprehensive healing\nprogram to patients and health care practitioners across the country and to\ndesign research studies to further test and refine the approach. Kaiser's new\nbook, Healing HIV: How to Rebuild Your Immune System , is a comprehensive\ntreatment guide that teaches patients and practitioners how to improve\ntreatment outcomes while using less antiviral and total medication.",
