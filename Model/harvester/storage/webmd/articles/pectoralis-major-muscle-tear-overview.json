The two sections come together as the “pectoralis major tendon,” which wraps around the bone in your upper arm (the humerus). You might commonly refer to these chest muscles as “pecs.” They help you move your arms forward and backward, rotate them at the shoulder , and extend them.",

It’s best to have the surgery within 3 months after the injury to prevent the tendon from tearing again. Early repair can also help reduce your odds of scar tissue buildup and keep the muscle from shrinking.",
