The 50-year-old said she’s had trouble falling asleep since childhood. Then, “I opened myself to the possibility of my sleep changing,” she said. “I created nighttime rituals – journaling to clear my thoughts and express gratitude, tea, and dim lights. I also tried gentle yoga and meditation. I found acupuncture and magnesium helpful, too. All of these things helped rewire my brain and body to relax.  The quality of my sleep has significantly improved.”",

Quality sleep also means waking up feeling well-rested and ready to tackle your day feeling your best. It’s normal to experience several wake-ups during the night. Waking up is normal, as long as you can fall back to sleep quickly.”",
