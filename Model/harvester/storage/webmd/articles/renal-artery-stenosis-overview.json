        "Renal artery stenosis is a narrowing of the arteries that carry blood to one or both of the kidneys . Most often seen in older people with atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), renal artery stenosis can worsen over time, often leading to hypertension (high blood pressure) and kidney damage. With less blood reaching the kidneys , the body mistakes it for low blood pressure . This signals the kidneys to release hormones that lead to an increase in blood pressure . Over time, renal artery stenosis can lead to kidney failure .",
