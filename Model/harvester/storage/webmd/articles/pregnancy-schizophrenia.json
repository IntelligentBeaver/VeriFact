        "It’s important to think about what having a baby with schizophrenia might mean for you and for your future child. For some people, schizophrenia is an ongoing condition while others may have just one or a few episodes. The most common symptoms of schizophrenia include delusions, hallucinations , trouble thinking, and lack of insight. If you are having these symptoms, it may be hard for you to think through what pregnancy and having a baby would mean.",
        "You’ll also need to consider other factors that may affect your ability to have a healthy pregnancy. Many people with schizophrenia smoke or have other substance use disorders. They also are more likely than the average person to have other health issues. For instance, people with schizophrenia are more often overweight or obese and are prone to developing diabetes. It’s a good idea for anyone thinking about pregnancy to make sure that any health conditions they have are treated and under control. This includes your schizophrenia and other physical health problems that may or may not be related to your schizophrenia."

One big study looking at antipsychotic use in early pregnancy suggests that they don’t generally lead to more birth defects. The study found a small increase in risk with risperidone, but more study is needed to be sure. If you’re taking risperidone and are worried about birth defects, ask your doctor if you could take a different medicine instead.",
