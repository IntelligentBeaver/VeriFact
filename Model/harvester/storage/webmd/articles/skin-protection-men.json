To avoid painful burns, premature aging, and potentially lethal skin cancer, you can stay indoors (not much fun), you can keep fully covered in dark clothing and a wide-brimmed hat (not very stylish), or, you can slather on the sunscreen from head to toe.",

        "Don't even bother buying a sunblock or sunscreen with less than an SPF (Sun Protection Factor) of 15. Each level of SPF increases the time you can stay in the sun without burning. For example, if you'd normally start to burn in 10 minutes without protection, you might be able to last up to 150 minutes wearing a product with an SPF of 15.",
        "The lighter-skinned you are, the higher the SPF you should use. Still, even if you're as pasty as the Pillsbury Doughboy, you should be fine with SPF 15 as long as you reapply it every two hours or so.",
        "UVA, UVB: UB confused? Don't fret. Sunlight emits two types of ultraviolet (UV) rays harmful to human skin. UVB rays are the primary cause of sunburn and skin cancer . UVA rays are somewhat weaker, but still destructive. Guard against both with a \"broad spectrum\" product containing benzophenones, oxybenzone, sulisobenzone, titanium dioxide , zinc oxide , or Parsol 1789.",
        "PABA has been a basic sun protection ingredient for many years. Unfortunately, it can stain clothes and may cause allergic reactions. It works, but there are PABA-free alternatives that are just as effective, such as the ones listed above.",
        "Sunblock or sunscreen? It doesn't matter which you choose. Both work well but in different ways. Sunscreens chemically absorb UV rays so not as many reach your skin; sunblocks physically deflect them.",
        "Creams, gels, lotions, wax sticks, or ointments? None have been proven more effective than any other, so use whatever you're most comfortable with on your skin.",
        "Cheap or chic? Expensive doesn't mean better. You may prefer the smell or feel of more expensive products, but you won't get better protection."
