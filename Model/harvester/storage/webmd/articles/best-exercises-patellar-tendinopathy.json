        "Patellar tendinopathy happens when the patella tendon that connects your kneecap (patella) to your shinbone is torn or injured. Stress on the tendon causes tiny tears, which are usually small enough for your body to manage, but too many tears become painful and require medical attention. This kind of repetition injury commonly occurs in athletes, especially in sports that involve a lot of jumping . In fact, it happens so commonly that patellar tendinitis is commonly called “jumper’s knee”.",
        "Even if you aren’t a professional volleyball player, you should keep an eye on your knees. Other risk factors for developing patellar tendinopathy include general physical exercise particularly if it’s repetitive or if you’re just started a new routine and are training on concrete or high-impact areas. In addition, weight can be a factor, because your weight causes increased pressure on the knees.",
        "To treat patellar tendinopathy , doctors will prescribe physical therapy to strengthen the muscles and help you retain full range of movement. Physical therapy remedies include stretching, strengthening, a knee brace, or potentially iontophoresis, a small electric shock therapy, delivered to your tendon."
