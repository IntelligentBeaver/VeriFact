The amount you take can be based on your body weight or how much fat you eat, although your doctor also may use standard dosing guidelines. Most adults starting PERT take two to three capsules (20,000 to 25,000 lipase units each) per regular-sized meal, and one to two for snacks and small meals. Once you see how your body does with the medication, your doctor may want you to take a different dosage. The level of pancreatic enzyme insufficiency can vary from person to person.
