These shots can help to improve vision and also stop the damage that causes vision issues to get worse. Multiple eye injections have been approved to treat diabetic macular edema. Most of these medicines are called anti-VEGF therapies because they block a substance in the eye called VEGF.",
        "In 2022, Vabysmo became the first eye injection that could block two substances (VEGF and another substance called Ang-2) in people with diabetic macular edema. This may allow people to get their shots less often."

        "Over time, people with diabetes may develop eye problems . One of the most common eye conditions caused by diabetes is called diabetic retinopathy . This condition affects the retina , which is the layer of the eye that processes the images that you see. When blood sugar levels stay high for a long time in people with diabetes, it can damage small blood vessels . Damaged blood vessels can slowly leak fluid and blood into the retina. As diabetic retinopathy gets worse, the eye may begin to form new blood vessels to replace the leaky ones. This is called proliferative diabetic retinopathy."

        "People with proliferative diabetic retinopathy may develop another eye condition called macular edema . The macula is the part of the retina that processes the images in the center of your vision (right in front of you). In macular edema, the macula swells and thickens. This can cause changes to your vision, such as blurry vision , double vision, floating spots, and dull colors. Some people may also lose part or all of their central vision.",
        "The key to treating diabetic macular edema is to limit or stop the damage to the retina. Stopping the damage can help to improve vision and may also help to keep vision problems from getting worse. Some medicines that are injected into the eye can help to stop this eye damage. Most of these medicines work by blocking a substance called VEGF, which plays an important part in forming new blood vessels in the eye. By blocking VEGF, these medicines can slow down the formation of new blood vessels.",
        "The active ingredient in Vabysmo is a medicine called faricimab. Like some of the other medicines that are used to treat diabetic macular edema, this medicine blocks VEGF. Unlike those other medicines, Vabysmo also blocks another substance called Ang-2. Having too much Ang-2 in the eye can make blood vessels unstable and leaky. By blocking both VEGF and Ang-2, Vabysmo can stop the eye from growing as many new blood vessels and also help to make the current blood vessels more stable. This can reduce the leakiness and fluid buildup that causes vision issues."
