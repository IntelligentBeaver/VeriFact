        "July 10, 2023 – Scientists have developed a biodegradable implant that helps chemotherapy drugs penetrate the blood-brain barrier and deliver a direct hit on brain tumors.",
        "It’s the latest advance in a rapidly growing field using ultrasound – high-frequency sound waves undetectable to humans – to fight cancer and other diseases.",
        "The problem addressed by the researchers is the blood-brain barrier, a nearly impenetrable blood vessel lining that keeps harmful molecules from passing into the brain from the blood. But this lining can also block chemo drugs from reaching cancer cells.",
        "So the scientists implanted one-centimeter-square devices into the skulls of mice , directly behind the tumor site. The implants generate ultrasound waves, loosening the barrier and allowing the drugs to reach the tumor. The sound waves leave healthy tissue undamaged.",
        "“You inject the drug into the body and turn on the ultrasound at the same time. You're going to hit precisely at the tumor area every single time you use it,\" said lead study author Thanh Nguyen, PhD, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Connecticut."

        "The biodegradable implant is made of glycine , an amino acid that’s also strongly piezoelectric, meaning it vibrates when subjected to an electrical current. To make it, researchers cultivated glycine crystals, shattered them into pieces, and finally used a process called electrospinning, which applies a high electrical voltage to the nanocrystals.",

        "His earlier biodegradable implant broke apart from the force, but the new glycine implant is more flexible, stable, and highly piezoelectric. It could be implanted after a patient has surgery to remove a brain tumor, to continue treating residual cancer cells. The implant dissolves harmlessly in the body over time, and doctors can control its lifespan."
