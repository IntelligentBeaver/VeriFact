        "By Ryan Ungaro, MD, as told to Barbara Brody Back when I was in medical school, I decided to specialize in gastroenterology because I thought it was a  fascinating field. I still do. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, including those with Crohn's, are particularly rewarding to treat because I really get to know them and support them closely over many years. It's my job to usher them through difficult times and get them back to enjoying a good quality of life. As director of the Comprehensive Care for the Recently Diagnosed IBD Patient (COMPASS-IBD) program at Mount Sinai in New York, I see many people who have only recently learned that they have Crohn's. Often these patients have classic symptoms, which include diarrhea , abdominal pain, and urgency. But many don't realize there are a number of Crohn's disease symptoms, and potential complications, that aren't so obviously tied to the digestive system"

        "Unexplained weight loss can also be a symptom of Crohn's because body-wide inflammation has the potential to speed up your metabolism. Meanwhile, people with Crohn's often lose weight if they aren’t absorbing nutrients like they should. That's most likely to happen when the bowel gets ulcerated or inflamed or because you have chronic diarrhea. For that reason, weight loss could indicate new disease (in someone who hasn't yet been diagnosed) or be a sign of a flare up in someone who's been living with Crohn's for some time. In other cases, patients lose weight simply because they're eating less in an effort to avoid triggering or worsening their GI symptoms. Fatigue is another common complaint among people with Crohn's disease. It may be linked to inflammation, but we also see it in many patients who seem to have their disease well-controlled. This is an active area of research, so hopefully we'll know more about why this happens in the future."
