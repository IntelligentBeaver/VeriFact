        "Salma Hayek’s plane landed in Sierra Leone last fall, after some 20 hours in the air. She was part of a global health care initiative sponsored by UNICEF to vaccinate children against tetanus , and she had barely been on the ground an hour before she saw firsthand just what the disease can do. “We hadn’t even gone to the hotel yet, and we stopped at a hospital,” she says. “I went into a room where a baby was seven days old and had been born with tetanus. Something told me that we needed to leave,” out of respect for the family. “We stepped out of the room, and as we did, the baby died.”",
        "This scenario is, unfortunately, all too common in places like Sierra Leone, one of Africa’s poorest nations, where basic medical care, including vaccinations, is often inadequate. UNICEF’s goal is to eradicate tetanus worldwide by 2012; the disease kills 128,000 children and 30,000 women in developing countries every year. Hayek’s trip was part of her role to help oversee the vaccination program as a global spokesperson for the One Pack=One Vaccine program. Proceeds from sales of specially marked Pampers diapers and wipes are directly donated to tetanus prevention efforts in African and Asian countries where the disease is most prevalent.",
        "Hayek’s trip showed her the extent of the problem in close-up, intimate terms—sometimes literally so. Take the now much-publicized story of her putting a tiny newborn boy to her breast . Only a week old, he had been born into poverty-stricken conditions in a remote area of Sierra Leone. “He was so skinny,” Hayek recalls. “His mother had lost her milk, probably because of malnutrition.” So Hayek, with the mother’s approval, instinctively did what almost any nursing mother would feel compelled to do. She fed him. “You should have seen his face!” she says. “He just lit up. He became alive. I mean, how could I not feed him? I was in the field, my daughter wasn’t with me, I was either going to throw away the milk or feed this baby.”"

        "The Academy Award-nominated actress, executive producer of the popular TV series Ugly Betty , and star of the film Frida -- who’s currently playing Alec Baldwin’s girlfriend in a high-profile turn on the hit TV comedy 30 Rock -- is well known for her activism on domestic violence, environmental issues, and AIDS. She served as the spokesperson for the Avon Foundation’s Speak Out Against Domestic Violence program, appeared before the U.S. Senate to encourage extension of the Violence Against Women Act, and traveled to the Arctic Circle for Earth Day 2005 to heighten awareness of global warming. But after the birth of her daughter, Valentina, in September 2007, the 42-year-old Hayek says, “I was thinking that I don’t have as much time and I have to focus more, so this year I’m going to take a break from causes.”",
        "But then One Pack=One Vaccine came calling, and she learned about tetanus. “One mother or child dies every three minutes from something that is entirely preventable,” she says. Indeed, Hayek became so committed to the campaign that she made the recent journey to Africa -- her first trip without Valentina.",
        "“The tetanus toxin produced by tetanus spores is one of the most potent toxins ever identified,” explains François Gasse, MD, a senior project officer at UNICEF who leads the neonatal tetanus campaign. “It attacks the central nervous system , producing painful, violent, and uncontrolled spasms that lead to death in over 70% of the cases, mostly through respiratory failure but also aspiration pneumonia .”"

The neonatal form of tetanus occurs in newborn infants who have not received immunity from their mothers (because they have not been vaccinated themselves).

Paul Bettany [the actor and husband of actor Jennifer Connelly] said something about too much fruit and gestational diabetes, and I thought, What does he know?” But then she discussed these concerns with her midwife and doula, who advised her to watch her diet, especially given her family history of diabetes. Is she ready for a second child? Hayek, who said “I do” to businessman François Henri Pinault, Valentina’s father, this past Valentine’s Day, isn’t sure, but she hasn’t ruled it out, even at 42. For Hayek, becoming a mom at this stage of her life was definitely the right way to go. “I wouldn’t trade this for anything in the world,” she says. “I feel that I’ve done enough things in life where I can appreciate the time I spend with her as my No. 1 priority and not feel I’m missing out on something. I feel I’m a lot more patient."
