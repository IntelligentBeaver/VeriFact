        "There are two types of smoking cessation products: Some contain nicotine, and some don’t. Nicotine replacement therapy products, like gums, lozenges, sprays, and inhalers , work by giving you a small dose of nicotine without all the other dangerous chemicals found in cigarettes. These are generally recommended for lighter smokers.",
        "That way, you can wean yourself off the nicotine and withdrawal isn’t so bad. They don’t stop the cravings, though. Most nicotine replacement products are available over-the-counter.",
        "There are also prescription drugs that don’t use nicotine. They change the way your brain works to ease withdrawal symptoms and make you not want to smoke as much or at all. The FDA has approved two of these products: bupropion and varenicline."
