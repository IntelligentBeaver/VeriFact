        "Although advocating for yourself is essential with any health concern, when the diagnosis is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer , it’s even more important. On March 27, 2006, Janet Shomaker felt a lump in her breast. A few weeks later, she was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma . She also learned the cancer was HER2-positive, which meant it contained a protein that encourages the growth of cancer cells making it more aggressive than other forms of cancer. At the time, Shomaker was 44 years old, mom of two young children, and co-founder of a national research company. In those first shell-shocked days, a good friend and cancer survivor encouraged her to be “responsibly selfish” – a term she would come to understand in the months that followed. “I had the personality that I can do most things on my own and I don’t need help,” she says. “Being responsibly selfish meant taking control of my treatment plan while I allowed friends and family to care for me and my family.”"

        "Shomaker believes that being responsibly selfish helped her get the best possible medical care. Here, cancer experts share five important ways to act and advocate for yourself when you’re diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer. Once you get over the initial shock of diagnosis, it can be empowering to learn as much as you can about your type of cancer and its treatment. Just make sure you have access to credible sources. “Rather than searching HER2-positive online and going down a rabbit hole, the first-line source for information is your physician ,” says William J. Gradishar, MD, FASCO, FACP, at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University and chair of the NCCN Guidelines Panel for Breast Cancer. “Your health care team can refer you to sources to do more reading.” If the task of researching becomes overwhelming, ask a family member or friend to help sort through the information as you prepare for upcoming appointments.
