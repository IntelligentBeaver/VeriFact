That means more people spending time in close quarters indoors, like classrooms, and college students traveling back to campuses. It’s a recipe for an unpredictable period in the pandemic’s fifth year, and infectious disease experts are beginning to worry.",

It may be a surge and it may continue. There’s been a lot of COVID out there, and for the first time, I’m just a little nervous about how much of a dip we’re going to get before it goes up again in the wintertime.”"

Vaccination rates are very low nationwide – only an estimated 22% of adults got the latest 2023-24 version of the shot, and 37% of people ages 65 and older received at least one dose of the newest formulation, which is updated annually. Just 9% of people 65 and older have gotten two doses of the 2023-24 vaccine, which the CDC recommends be spaced 4 months apart."
