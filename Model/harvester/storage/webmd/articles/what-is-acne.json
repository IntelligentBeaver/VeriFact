        "If there's one thing you can count on as a teen, it's acne. More than 85% of teenagers have this common skin problem, which is marked by clogged pores (whiteheads, blackheads), painful pimples, and, sometimes, hard, deep lumps on the face, neck, shoulders, chest, back, and upper arms.",
        "If your mom and dad had acne, chances are good that you will, too. But there are many ways to prevent (and treat) acne today to keep the condition minimal, prevent scarring, and leave your skin glowing.",
        "Acne affects people of all skin tones, but it can be particularly challenging for people with darker skin. One pimple or breakout in dark skin can result in long-lasting dark marks, scars, or keloids (scar tissue that grows beyond the original scar). Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation ( PIH ) can develop from the skin's release of melanin, which can be triggered by acne or harsh acne products. PIH is more likely to occur in darker skin and can last longer than the acne itself.",
        "Before starting any treatment, it is important to differentiate between acne and other conditions that may look similar, such as ingrown hairs. Treating acne should be done gently to prevent further irritation and dryness, which can worsen dark spots and scarring. Topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide can help clear pores and reduce inflammation."
