        "If you’ve ever had pericarditis, you know how serious it can be. An autoimmune disorder, heart attack , or viral infection usually causes pericarditis. But sometimes the reason is unknown. You can even develop a flare of pericarditis, also known as recurrent pericarditis. Your immune system can trigger the recurrence because of inflammation . Up to 30% of people with pericarditis will have a flare within 18 months of their first episode. You may try to avoid everyday activities, have sleep problems, or notice you can't work as much. Along with medical treatment, lifestyle changes can improve your well-being and help you live fully with recurrent pericarditis. Although you can’t control why you get a flare, you can take steps to lower your stress and inflammation. Here’s a closer look at how to integrate stress reduction into your life with recurrent pericarditis."
