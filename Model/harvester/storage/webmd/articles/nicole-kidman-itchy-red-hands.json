She’s been photographed on a few occasions with raw-red hands. Kidman doesn’t publicly talk about her dealings with eczema , but it’s clear by her itchy red hands that she has this skin condition.",
        "Kidman is a relatively private actress who keeps to herself. However, her skin has been photographed red, cracked, and bleeding at times. It appears that Kidman’s eczema is primarily in her hands, which she tries to keep out of photographs, especially when her skin seems to be incredibly irritated or she’s dealing with a flare-up.",

It typically develops in children before the age of one, but it can develop for the first time in adults. Eczema is a chronic condition with no treatment but a variety of options to manage symptoms and flare-ups."
