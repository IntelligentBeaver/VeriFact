        "End-stage, or stage IV, COPD is the final stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most people reach it after years of living with the disease and the lung damage it causes. As a result, your quality of life is low. You’ll have exacerbations, or flares, often – one of which could be fatal.",
        "COPD is an ongoing lung disease that has no cure and worsens over time. It's estimated that almost 400 million people around the world live with COPD. There are four stages of the illness, ranging from mild to severe. Doctors grade the stages by how much your airflow is blocked. A simple test measures how much total air you can get in one deep breath, and also how hard you can breathe out.",
