Drowsy driving, such as driving your infant to the pediatrician when you have had little or no sleep , is responsible for an estimated 100,000 crashes each year, according to The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. And sleep loss can also increase a new mom’s risk of postpartum mood problems.",
