        "This month, the American Diabetes Association issued new guidelines for managing all diabetes, including type 2 . Among the recommendations is an emphasis on higher weight loss goals (of up to 15%), the importance of a good night’s sleep, increased levels of physical activity, and achieving lower blood pressure.",
        "As I skimmed the guidelines, it struck me that when it comes to type 2 diabetes care, complacency is the enemy.",
        "What do I mean by complacency in diabetes care?",
        "It can be many things.",
        "Overall, I think it means standing still.",
        "For example, maybe you’ve stopped stepping on the bathroom scale because the number is not one you’d like to see. Or maybe you’ve given up on finger sticks for your blood glucose for a similar reason.",
        "Complacency might also be spurred by denial. Although you’ve noticed a tingling in your fingers and toes, which can be a symptom of nerve damage, a possible complication of high sugars, you choose to pretend it isn’t there. The same might go for blurry vision or a cut that you noticed rather than felt between your toes. Even if the blurred vision might be a sign of diabetic retinopathy that could lead to a loss of vision or that cut, if left untreated, could lead to an amputation down the road."
