        "First approved in 2021 for a rare blood disorder, Empaveli (pegcetacoplan) is now approved as the first targeted medicine for adults and children aged 12 years or older with two rare and serious kidney diseases: complement component 3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and primary immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC‑MPGN). These diseases can cause serious damage to your kidneys and may lead to kidney failure over time. Although rare, these conditions affect about 5,000 people in the U.S. Without effective treatment, many people may eventually need dialysis or a kidney transplant.",
        "In both conditions, a part of your immune system called the complement system becomes overactive. This leads to kidney inflammation and damage. Empaveli helps by blocking this part of the immune system, which may slow down or prevent further kidney damage."
