        "A canker sore is a small, shallow, open wound or ulcer in your mouth that can make eating and talking uncomfortable. It is also known as a mouth ulcer or aphthous ulcer. It looks like a white or yellowish open wound with a red border.",

        "Minor canker sores",
        "Minor canker sores are the most common type of canker sores. These oval-shaped canker sores may appear three or four times a year. They typically happen in people ages 10 to 20. They’re less than 1 centimeter across and heal in about a week without scarring.",
