Some will learn to drive, have relationships, and live almost entirely on their own. Others will need more day-to-day care, but even then may still be able to hold a part-time job and participate in meaningful social activities.",

And doctors are always learning more about health issues people with Down syndrome face as they get older. So it helps to know what options are out there and what you’ll want to keep an eye on."

They need to figure out where to live, what to do for work, and how to create new social circles outside of school. It’s exciting, but stressful for any young adult, and can be even harder for someone with Down syndrome. That makes it important to start planning as early as possible."
