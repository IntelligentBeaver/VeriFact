The more Kegels you do, and the longer you hold them, the better control you will have over those leaks caused by sneezing , laughing, or picking up your baby.",

To get which muscles they are, start by doing the exercise while you use the bathroom. As you urinate, manipulate your muscles until the stream temporarily stops. Then release and let the urine flow. Remember what that feels like, and when you're not urinating, contract, hold, and release those same muscles. Try to do this 10 times per session, three times a day.",

You may want to practice first using a doll or a rolled-up blanket or towel that's the same size as your baby. Do the moves full-out only when you’re certain there’s no danger of dropping your baby.

Then, return to the starting position and lunge with the opposite leg. This will help strengthen your legs, back muscles, and core. Repeat 8-10 times on each side.",

Reach back with your behind as if you’re sitting in a chair, keeping your knees over your ankles. Repeat 8-10 times on each side.",
        "Rock-a-baby squats and curls: Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart. Holding your baby tight and close to your chest, squat down, allowing your baby's feet to touch the floor. As you rise up, bring the baby closer to your chest. Repeat 15 times. Note: You should do this exercise only when your baby is at least 10-12 weeks old."
