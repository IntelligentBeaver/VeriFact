Many people decide to join a clinical trial to access the newest treatment and get extra care and attention as they deal with their disease."

        "Your doctor will want to know if you’re considering a clinical trial so they can stay up to date on how it may impact you. Your doctor can also look at potential clinical trials with you and help you figure out what might be a good fit. If you find one you’re interested in, you can ask: What is the purpose of this clinical trial and what phase is it in? Will the researchers work with my doctor? Who will oversee my care? Who will I get in touch with if I have problems, questions, or concerns? What were the results in past studies of this treatment? How likely are they to apply to me? Is there anything else I can read about this clinical trial? What kinds of treatments and tests would I need to have? How often are they done? Would I need to plan on extra time or travel? What side effects might I expect? Are there other risks? How do you know if the treatment is working? Will I have to be in the hospital for any part of the trial? Will I have to pay for anything? Will my insurance cover the treatment? If I am harmed because of the research, what treatment will I be entitled to? How long will I be in the clinical trial? How long will the clinical trial last? Will I still be able to work if I am in the clinical trial? Are there reasons I could be removed from the clinical trial? Are there reasons the clinical trial might be stopped early? Is long-term follow-up care part of the trial? What would it involve? If the treatment is working for me, can I keep getting it even after the clinical trial ends? Can I talk to other people taking part in the clinical trial? Will I be able to find out about the results of the clinical trial?"
