        "A panic attack is a sudden feeling of overwhelming fear or distress that includes physical symptoms. The sensations usually peak at around 10 minutes after onset and go away quickly. A diagnosis typically relies on the patient's description, since the symptoms usually disappear before a health professional can observe them.",
        "Sometimes, people use the terms \"anxiety attack\" and \"panic attack\" interchangeably, but they aren't really the same thing. Everyone experiences anxiety , sometimes at high levels. The sudden onset of intense feelings along with physical symptoms is a different thing and is properly labeled as a panic attack.",
        "Around 11% of adults have a panic attack each year. If you have repeated panic attacks, you may have panic disorder, especially if you have changed your behavior to avoid triggering an attack. Drugs and psychotherapy are the major paths of treatment. Left untreated, panic disorder can turn into agoraphobia , in which people are afraid of leaving their homes because they might face a stressful situation. Many of those with agoraphobia have difficulty riding in elevators, using public transportation, standing in line, and coping with other everyday situations."
