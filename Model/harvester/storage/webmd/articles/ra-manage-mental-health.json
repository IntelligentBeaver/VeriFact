If you have great mental health and you’re faced with a chronic illness , it could help protect you. If you're already struggling with something and you have a chronic illness, then it could make it worse. Depression and pain are strongly related."

Think of a toothache -- something a lot of people can relate to. You're really irritable or just don't want to be around anyone when you're in a lot of pain. Imagine these symptoms are prolonged and chronic. You think, “Will this ever stop? Will it ever get better?” Those kinds of thoughts are often associated with both depression and anxiety, two big things that we often see with any type of chronic illness, including arthritis."

        "There are different ways that you can address these issues. Of course, as a therapist, I would push that aspect, but I really think therapy has to be the right fit for you. Mindfulness is another thing that has a lot of scientific backing. You can find mindfulness meditation scripts for chronic pain -- either ones you can read and practice or recorded ones you can listen to. There are great mindfulness and meditation apps these days. The idea is that if you can be focused on the present moment, you'll realize that every sensation, feeling, and thought we have changes from moment to moment. So even if something feels like it's not tolerable, that's OK because it's going to change. We tend to want to avoid noticing these things when they're happening because they're uncomfortable, but [mindfulness] really pushes you to do the opposite of that. I know it's hard for people to buy into doing something different when you’re drained of energy from a chronic illness. And people often think of therapy as being this long, drawn-out process. Kind of like, “I'm already dealing with something that feels like it's never gonna end. I want a solution now.” But things like CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) or mindfulness for chronic pain are going to get you some relatively quick results. I would encourage people to see doctors they trust who line up with the things that are important to them because [managing mental health] is going to take a lot of effort. But there are ways to get things manageable so you can live a full and enjoyable life adapted to your new needs. It's just a matter of learning what those are and then getting the right resources."
