        "A tracheostomy is a hole in your trachea, or windpipe, that a doctor makes to help you breathe. The doctor usually puts a tracheostomy tube, sometimes called a trach (pronounced “trake”) tube, through the hole and into your windpipe.  While it's in place, you breathe through the tube, rather than your nose and mouth.",
        "Tracheotomy (without the “s”) refers to the cut the surgeon makes into your windpipe, and a tracheostomy is the opening itself. But some people use both terms to mean the same thing.",
        "Is a tracheostomy permanent?",
        "A tracheostomy can be temporary or permanent. Often, it's  a temporary solution that helps you breathe more easily while a medical issue -- such as swelling in your airway -- clears up. Sometimes, it's in place because a medical problem is making it hard for you to breathe on your own for an extended time. In that case, the tracheostomy tube is connected to a breathing machine, called a ventilator, and will be needed as long as you need the machine."

This might be done outside the hospital, such as at the scene of an accident. It's most often done when the airway is blocked and emergency medical workers can't place a breathing tube through the nose or mouth. These procedures can be lifesaving, but are difficult to do and have a higher risk of complications than planned tracheotomies.",

But there's a lot of variation, depending on why you needed help with breathing in the first place and your overall health, age, and other factors. One study, in children with tracheostomies for a variety of conditions, found that 85% were alive after one year and 68% were alive after five years. Most, but not all, the children needed to keep the tracheostomy tubes for the whole period. Another study of older adults who left a hospital with a tracheostomy found that about 70% were alive a year later, whether or not their trach tube was attached to a breathing machine when they left the hospital. Some also had their tubes removed during the study period."

One method is to simply cover your trach tube with a finger while you talk. Another method is to attach a speaking valve to the tube. Even people using ventilators can get special speaking valves. Your voice may be quieter and sound different from before. Therapists also can help you find different communication methods,  such as writing, texting, pointing to pictures, or using computers and other devices."
