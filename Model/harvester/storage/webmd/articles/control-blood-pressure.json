        "1. Hold the French fries and other salty foods. Choose low-sodium and no-salt-added foods. Limit the amount of salt that you cook with. You shouldn’t eat more than a teaspoon of salt (which has 2,300 milligrams of sodium) per day if you’re healthy. Some people have an even smaller limit. For instance, people with heart disease should not get more than 1,500 milligrams per day. Ask your doctor what’s OK for you. Read labels on foods or menu items to see how much you get in a serving.",
        "2. Limit alcohol . Drink too much, and your numbers go up. Men should limit themselves to two alcoholic drinks a day, while women should stick to just one a day. (One drink is a single serving of wine, beer, or a small amount of hard liquor.)"
