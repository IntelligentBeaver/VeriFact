If the tissue was diagnosed as HER2-positive, that means that your cancer produced too much of a growth-promoting protein. About 15% of the 268,000 women living in the U.S. diagnosed with breast cancer each year fall into this group."

Your tissue also is tested for hormone receptors , such as whether it carries above-normal levels of estrogen or progesterone . Hormone-driven breast cancers are the most common type, affecting nearly three-fourths of women diagnosed."
