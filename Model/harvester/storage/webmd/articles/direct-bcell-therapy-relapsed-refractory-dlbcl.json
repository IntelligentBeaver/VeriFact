Through these scientific studies, doctors test how well new medications work and learn the best ways to use existing treatments. In the area of direct B-cell cytolytics, researchers are looking for alternatives to the currently approved medications. Many of the immunomodulating drugs used to treat DLBCL rely on the same antigens to identify and target cancerous B cells. But when DLBCL comes back, the cancer cells often don’t have those antigens anymore. That means the most common treatments don’t work. To get past that, doctors are working on direct B-cell cytolytics that target different antigens."
