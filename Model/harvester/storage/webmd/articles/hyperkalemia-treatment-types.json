        "When you have too much potassium in your blood, it’s called hyperkalemia. There are two types of hyperkalemia: acute and chronic. Acute hyperkalemia is a sudden, severe rise in blood potassium levels. Chronic hyperkalemia tends to be milder but lasts for longer time. Even if you’re not having any symptoms, hyperkalemia can affect your heart and other parts of your body, so it’s important to treat it. The type of treatment you get depends on whether it’s acute or chronic and what’s causing it. Generally, acute hyperkalemia needs emergency treatment, whereas chronic hyperkalemia can be managed with medication and diet changes."

If you’re dehydrated, drinking water might help. But if you have an underlying condition, you might need medicine. What is the first-line treatment for high potassium levels? It depends on the cause and severity. For acute hyperkalemia, the first treatment is usually calcium. This helps prevent arrhythmias. How do you feel when your potassium is too high? If you have mild hyperkalemia, you might get nausea, diarrhea, and stomach pain, or no symptoms at all. If your potassium is dangerously high, you may have chest pain, heart palpitations, heart arrhythmia, and muscle weakness or numbness."

High potassium treatment depends on how severe it is, whether it came on suddenly, and what’s causing it. Mild, chronic hyperkalemia can usually be treated with medication and diet changes. If you have sudden hyperkalemia along with trouble breathing, extreme muscle weakness, abdominal pain, or symptoms of a heart attack, go to the emergency room.",

        "How long does hyperkalemia treatment take to work? Emergency hyperkalemia treatment starts to work within a few minutes. Medications for chronic hyperkalemia might need a few days to work. Will hyperkalemia go away on its own? If you’re healthy and have mild hyperkalemia, your kidneys might be able to take care of it on their own. But if you have complications or underlying conditions, you’ll probably need further treatment. Can hyperkalemia be cured? If you have chronic hyperkalemia from medications or an underlying condition, it’s likely to come back. Does drinking water reduce hyperkalemia? It depends on what’s causing it. If you’re dehydrated, drinking water might help. But if you have an underlying condition, you might need medicine. What is the first-line treatment for high potassium levels? It depends on the cause and severity. For acute hyperkalemia, the first treatment is usually calcium. This helps prevent arrhythmias. How do you feel when your potassium is too high? If you have mild hyperkalemia, you might get nausea, diarrhea, and stomach pain, or no symptoms at all. If your potassium is dangerously high, you may have chest pain, heart palpitations, heart arrhythmia, and muscle weakness or numbness."
