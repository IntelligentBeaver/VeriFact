        "If your doctor has recommended infusion therapy, this is probably because standard treatment hasn’t helped relieve symptoms caused by moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis . You most likely have been taking medications by mouth, orally. Infusions are medications delivered to your body by intravenous (IV), directly into your bloodstream, sometimes with an option to go to injectables over time. Sometimes, infusion therapy is used as a first-line therapy for moderate-to-severe cases.",
        "“I think a lot of patients have an idea that IV infusions are stronger or more powerful [than the other medications],” says Raymond Cross, MD, medical director at the Center for Inflammatory Bowel and Colorectal Diseases at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. “In fact, that’s not the case. It’s just the way the drug is delivered.”",
