This is based on data from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). It discussed vaccine safety, vaccine effectiveness, rare negative side effects, and the U.S. vaccine supply.",
        "The CDC recommends that if you are ages 5 years and up that you get one updated (bivalent) booster if it has been at least 2 months since your last COVID-19 vaccine dose. This last dose can be your final primary series dose or an original (monovalent) booster. If you have received more than one original (monovalent) booster, the CDC still recommends that you get an updated (bivalent) booster.",
        "The Pfizer vaccine received full FDA approval on Aug. 23, 2021, and was no longer under emergency use authorization (EUA). It is now marketed under the name Comirnaty."
