He knows many of his customers by name and by face, and today he fills prescriptions for children whose parents played Little League baseball on teams that he coached in the 1970s and '80s. For Joseph, a stroll through his hometown of Leesburg, Va., means greeting the customers who are also his friends and neighbors.",
        "\"They call me at home to ask questions. I don't mind,\" he says. \"I know a lot of my patients. I know their problems, if they've been in the hospital or not. You have to know your people and they have to know you care.\"",
        "But things have changed a lot since he started in the business in the 1960s. In those days, there were fewer prescription drugs on the market and few had health insurance that covered them. Prescription drugs weren't advertised on television and managed care didn't exist. Back then, pharmacists and doctors were highly trusted and customers didn't ask many questions. \"There was no insurance ; everything was cash,\" Joseph remembers. It was, to be sure, a simpler time."
