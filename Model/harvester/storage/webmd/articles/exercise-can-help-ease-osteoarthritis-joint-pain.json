She knew she had to “keep going and keep moving” to get better, including after a second hip replacement about 10 years ago. When the Duke Health & Fitness Center opened in nearby Durham, NC, the real estate agent, entrepreneur, and former teacher signed up.",

        "Exercise has helped ease her osteoarthritis pain and improve her mobility. “It’s about setting goals for myself.” To keep up her routine, Rosenbluth sets out exercise clothes the night before. “That way if I see the clothes and I don’t exercise, I feel guilty all day.”"
