        "Dry eye disease happens when your eyes don’t make enough tears or your tears don’t work properly. Tears are more than just water; they’re a mix of water, oils, and mucus. Here’s how they keep eyes moist and healthy: The water layer keeps the eye hydrated and flushes out debris. The oil layer prevents tears from evaporating too quickly. The mucus layer helps tears spread evenly across the eye. When your eyes are dry, it can cause discomfort and even damage the surface of your eye. It can also make daily activities like reading, using your phone, or working on a computer more difficult."

        "There are two main types of dry eye disease: aqueous-deficient dry eye and evaporative dry eye. Many people have a combination of both. Aqueous-deficient dry eye: This happens when your eyes don’t produce enough of the watery part of your tears. It’s often linked to certain medical conditions, such as autoimmune diseases like Sjögren’s syndrome. Evaporative dry eye: This occurs when your tears dry up too quickly. It’s often caused by problems with the oil-producing glands in your eyelids, called meibomian glands. Environmental factors like dry air or wind can also make it worse. Both types of dry eye can lead to similar symptoms, but the causes might be different. Dry eye doesn’t just make your eyes feel uncomfortable. It can affect your vision and overall quality of life. When your eyes are dry, you may struggle with: Keeping your eyes open for long periods Reading, using screens, or driving, especially at night Irritation that makes focusing difficult or painful If left untreated, severe dry eye can damage the surface of your eye, increasing your risk of infections or long-term issues."

        "Dry eye disease can cause a variety of symptoms that may seem mild at first but can become more noticeable over time. In young adults, these symptoms often show up during activities that require intense focus, like studying, gaming, or using digital devices. These common actions make you blink less, which makes it harder for tears to keep your eyes moist and comfortable. If you're dealing with dry eye, you may have symptoms that include: A stinging, burning, or itchy sensation Feeling something gritty in their eye Blurred vision, especially after using a screen for a long time Eyes that feel tired or heavy, even after a good night’s sleep Light sensitivity, where bright lights feel uncomfortable The symptoms might come and go, depending on what you’re doing or the environment you’re in. For example, you might feel fine outdoors but notice discomfort after hours spent in an air-conditioned room or after staring at a screen. It’s important to pay attention to these signs. Left untreated, dry eye symptoms can worsen and interfere with daily life."

      "content": [
        "The symptoms of dry eye in young and older people can be similar, but how they show up and how they’re triggered might differ. Young adults often have dry eye symptoms during specific activities, while older adults are more likely to feel discomfort throughout the day, even when their eyes are at rest. For young adults, symptoms are often linked to lifestyle. Long hours on digital devices are a common trigger. Staring at screens reduces blinking, which can make your eyes feel dry, irritated, or tired. Symptoms in young adults may also come and go, depending on the environment. For example: Using a phone or laptop for hours can cause dryness and blurry vision. Spending time in air-conditioned or heated spaces can make symptoms worse. Wearing contact lenses for extended periods can increase irritation. Because young adults often have busy, active lives, they might dismiss their symptoms as temporary or not severe. However, even mild symptoms can impact their focus, performance, and comfort. In older adults, dry eye is more likely caused by natural changes in the body. Tear production tends to decrease with age, and conditions like menopause or other health issues can make it worse. Unlike younger people, older adults may feel constant dryness or grittiness, even when they’re not focusing on screens or other tasks. Their symptoms are often more severe and persistent and may require ongoing treatment or medical interventions."

        "There haven’t been many studies on dry eye disease in people as young as teens. However, you might be surprised to hear that dry eye is becoming more common in younger people. A narrative review of 2,633 articles and 54 eligible studies on dry eye in children found that dry eye symptoms in teenage girls were similar in severity and occurrence to those seen in adults. This suggests that dry eye can be just as serious for teens as it is for older adults. The study also pointed out that dry eye in young people is often overlooked and not treated as often as it should be. So why is dry eye happening more in young people? There are several possible reasons. Screen time. Most of us spend hours every day on screens —  phones, tablets, computers, TVs, and more. But research shows younger people and adults are staring at digital devices as many as nine hours a day. When you stare at a screen, you blink less. Blinking is how your eyes refresh their tears, so less blinking leads to drier eyes."

        "Dry eye is treatable. Many options are available, depending on the severity of your symptoms. Talk to your doctor about the best way to manage them and what your objective for treatment is. You may be able to get relief with some over-the-counter eye drops or lifestyle changes if your symptoms aren’t too severe. At-home remedies Artificial tears: Over-the-counter eye drops, often called Artificial tears , can add moisture to your eyes and relieve dryness. They’re easy to find at most drugstores. If you need to use them several times a day, look for preservative-free options to avoid irritation. Warm compresses: A warm compress is a simple way to help your eyes feel better. Soak a clean cloth in warm water, then place it over your closed eyes for a few minutes. This can improve the quality of your tears and make your eyes feel more comfortable. Hydration and diet : Staying hydrated is important for your overall health — and your eyes. Make sure you're drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon , walnuts , and flaxseeds, can also support your healthy tear production and reduce eye irritation. Lifestyle adjustments: Simple changes to your daily habits can make a big difference. Be sure to take regular breaks from screens to rest your eyes. Follow the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This helps reduce eye strain and keeps your eyes from drying out."

        "If your symptoms don’t improve with at home changes, your doctor might recommend other options including: Prescription eye drops: If over-the-counter drops don’t work, your doctor may prescribe eye drops like cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoralor) or lifitegrast (Xiidra ). These medications help reduce swelling in the eyes, which can improve tear production. Over time, this can make your eyes feel more comfortable and less dry. Punctal plugs: Punctal plugs are tiny devices that a doctor places in your tear ducts, the small openings in the corners of your eyes that drain tears. By blocking these ducts, the plugs help keep tears on your eyes longer, which can prevent them from drying out. LipiFlow therapy: LipiFlow is a special treatment for people whose dry eye is caused by blocked oil glands in the eyelids. These glands produce the oily layer of your tears that keeps them from evaporating too quickly. LipiFlow uses gentle heat and pressure to clear the blockages and get the glands working again. This helps your tears stay on your eyes and reduces dryness."
