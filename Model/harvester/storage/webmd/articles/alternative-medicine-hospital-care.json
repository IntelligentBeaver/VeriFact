        "As alternative medicine becomes more and more mainstream, patients including Jan Alcott and Carroll Clark are now being offered massages, acupuncture , and other complementary therapy along with their standard medical treatment. And the results are excellent, according to preliminary studies now underway at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.",
        "Alcott and Clark recently participated in studies that allowed them to receive massage therapy , acupuncture , or guided imagery after undergoing open- heart surgery.",
        "\"Our patients have gone through a very dramatic event and they're often in a great deal of discomfort,\" states study leader Gregory P. Fontana, MD, a heart surgeon at Cedars-Sinai in a written press release. \"I've always believed that massage and other therapies can be very powerful in helping patients relax. If they can allow themselves to relax, accept what has happened, and realize a state of well-being, pain becomes a less important part of their consciousness.\"",
        "Fontana's studies on the benefits of massage and acupuncture (the insertion of tiny needles at specific points on the body) are now in their final stages, while the study using guided imagery is just beginning. Guided imagery aims to make beneficial physical changes in the body by repeatedly visualizing them. These experiments, Fontana says, will pave the way toward larger studies."
