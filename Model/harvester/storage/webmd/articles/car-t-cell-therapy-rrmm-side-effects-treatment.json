Researchers think inflammation from CAR T-cell therapy and high levels of cytokines activate the cells that line your brain’s blood vessels. When this happens, it impacts your brain function. Symptoms include: Severe confusion Behavior changes Hallucinations Seizures Impaired speech Headache Tremors Trouble writing Eventually, ICANS can lead to brain swelling, coma, and even death.

Your medical team may recommend that you: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating, after you go to the bathroom, and when you return from outdoors. Avoid large crowds. Stay away from people who are sick. Don’t swim in ponds or lakes. Disinfect your kitchen counters and bathrooms daily. Get your flu, shingles, and COVID vaccines. Talk with your doctor about the best time to get them. It’s also important to stay up to date on doctor visits. Your medical team may want you to visit the cancer center where you got your CAR T-cell therapy every 2 to 2 months for a year. Of course, you should call 911 or go the nearest emergency room in between appointments if have life-threatening symptoms.",
