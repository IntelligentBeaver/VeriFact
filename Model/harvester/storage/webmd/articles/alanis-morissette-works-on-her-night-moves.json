        "\"I've always been a night owl,\" confesses Alanis Morissette, the seven-time Grammy Award-winning singer-turned-TV-fixture, who first skyrocketed to international fame in 1995 with her smash debut album, Jagged Little Pill . \"I used to think creativity was tied to burning the candlelight until 4 a.m. In the past I've done much of my writing late at night. But I've had to learn that creativity can happen in the middle of the afternoon, too.\"",
        "This time-swap doesn't come from some newfound desire to become an early bird. Morissette, 36, is in her third trimester of pregnancy -- she's due to give birth to a son with new husband Mario \"MC Souleye\" Treadway any day now (as of press time), and she finds it physically impossible to keep such late hours anymore.",
        "\"My body just shut down,\" she says ruefully, recalling how, before she was pregnant, a single day might involve developing or working on multiple television acting projects ( Weeds , Nip/Tuck ); laying tracks for a new album; writing her first book (philosophical musings meet photo-essay travelogue); lending her famous face to any number of charities -- the environment, eating disorders , Haitian rescue); training to run another marathon (she's competed in two); touring the chat show circuit (she guested on Chelsea Lately on E! last August); and, to top it off, \"returning those 43 phone calls\" -- all the while playing devoted newlywed."
