        "When you have ankylosing spondylitis (AS), you’re focused on taking care of yourself and avoiding flare-ups. As you manage the condition, the last thing you need is for medical expenses to take you by surprise too.",
        "Ankylosing spondylitis, also called Bechterew’s disease, is a type of arthritis that affects around 300,000 Americans. Over time, it can make some of your vertebrae fuse, stealing your flexibility and making you hunch forward. It also can lead to pain or discomfort in your ribs or hip and shoulder joints, and trigger uncomfortable inflammation in your eyes.",
        "There is no cure for AS, but medication and physical therapy may lessen your symptoms and perhaps slow down the disease. Surgery isn’t often needed unless you have severe joint damage.",
        "When your AS flares up, your healthcare costs climb. A study published in 2018 tallied median AS-specific healthcare costs at $10,250 per year, driven largely by high outpatient visits and drug bills.",
        "While most health insurance plans cover doctor’s visits, prescription medications , and physical therapy for AS, your deductibles and copays , or co-insurance premiums can add up over time. Research and early action position you to manage those costs more effectively."

Most insurance plans do cover physical therapy (at 50% to 75%) by a licensed therapist if that appointment is expected to deliver an “essential benefit.” But you might need to meet the annual deductible first. Also, some plans cap total therapy costs or the total number of sessions, and some states require a primary care doctor’s referral.",
