        "Jan. 29, 2025 – Two counties in the Kansas City area continue to grapple with what is now a yearlong outbreak of tuberculosis. Caused by airborne bacteria, the disease is highly contagious and has now sickened dozens of people and drawn on-the-ground assistance in Kansas from the CDC.",
        "Kansas health officials say the risk to the general public is “very low.”",
        "TB cases are not entirely uncommon in the United States. In 2023, there were 9,633 TB cases reported, CDC data shows, and in 2022, there were 565 TB deaths.",
        "This latest outbreak has proven difficult to contain as it now stretches into its second year. The first cases were identified in January 2024. Since then, 67 people have had active infections, and another 79 people had latent infections, meaning the bacteria were detected but inactive and not causing symptoms. About 1 in 10 people with latent infections will get sick, the CDC says. People with latent infections do not spread the disease."
