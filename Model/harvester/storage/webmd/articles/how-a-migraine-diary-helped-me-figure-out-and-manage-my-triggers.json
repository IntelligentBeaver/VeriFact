        "Anyone who knows me will tell you I'm all about energy, signs, and pattern changes. I firmly use them as cues to help guide me through life. And the same strategy applies to figuring out and managing my migraine triggers. Sometimes a migraine attack will catch me off guard, but there are usually signs that an attack is on the way. Once you learn to identify your triggers, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.",
        "Migraine Diary",
        "I've said it before, and I'm going to keep saying it: A migraine diary is a great way to help you identify, track, and manage your triggers. What did you eat? How did you feel? Your doctor needs this information to develop your strategic, customized treatment plan. Here's some added motivation to keep a migraine diary: When you identify your triggers, you are one step closer to managing and, in some cases, avoiding future attacks.",
        "Stress",
        "I'm a high-stress individual who chose a high - stress profession (former journalist turned marketing director). Naturally, I wasn't surprised following my migraine diagnosis to find out that stress is a leading trigger. Have you ever experienced a migraine after a stressful event? Exactly. I'm not a doctor, and I'm not going to get all scientific, but it's popular enough that we've coined the term “stress migraine” even though it's not a medically recognized diagnosis. I encourage you to be aware of stressful triggers. Are you putting stress on yourself, or is the pressure from outside triggers? Eliminating stress from your life is easier said than done. Trust me -- I get it."

While there are many upsides, one of the biggest as a person with migraine is that I do not have to deal with migraine-inducing fluorescent or flickering bulbs often found in office buildings. Sensitivity to indoor or outdoor light is reportedly one of the most common migraine symptoms. When I used to go into the office, my “migraine hack” was to leave my overhead office lights off and bring in green light therapy lamps . It created less stress on my eyes and helped me manage my symptoms. Another hack: sunglasses. I've been known to wear them indoors, on days when I'm having head tension and eye strain. I live in the Sunshine State, so I literally never leave home without a backup pair."
