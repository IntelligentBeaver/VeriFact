        "Ever wondered why someone describes themselves as an INTP or as an ENFJ? Chances are they’ve just taken a Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test. This test, also called the MBTI, was developed during World War II to categorize a person’s personality type. You take a formal questionnaire, which then lumps you into one of 16 personality groups.",
        "While it can be fun and may reveal some things about yourself that you didn’t realize, experts warn that you should take your result with a grain of salt. \"It’s a lot of fun, and it can help you figure out some of your personality traits,\" explained Rehan Aziz, MD, a psychiatrist at Hackensack Meridian Health in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. \"But most of us don’t fall neatly into bucket categories. There are so many different factors that come into play to shape how someone is.\"",

        "The MBTI was developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers during World War II. It’s based on the research of psychiatrist Carl Jung. He had a theory of \"individual preference.\" He believed that people feel emotions differently from one another because of basic differences in how they function mentally and emotionally. Briggs and Myers thought that people could use his ideas to help them recognize their own personalities. They spent two decades researching it, and the first MBTI instrument was published in 1962."
