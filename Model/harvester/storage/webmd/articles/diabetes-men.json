And over time, people who don’t have eye problems related to diabetes may get some form of eye problem. It’s important to control not only sugars, but also blood pressure and cholesterol to stop eye diseases from getting worse. Fortunately, the vision loss isn't significant in most.",
            "Kidney damage. The risk of kidney disease rises over time, meaning the longer you have diabetes, the greater your risk. This complication carries a significant risk of serious illness -- such as kidney failure and heart disease.",
            "Poor blood circulation and nerve damage. Damage to nerves and hardening of the arteries lead to less sensation and poor blood circulation in the feet. This can bring on more infections and a higher risk of ulcers that heal poorly. In turn, this can significantly raise the risk of amputation. Damage to nerves may also lead to digestive problems, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea ."
