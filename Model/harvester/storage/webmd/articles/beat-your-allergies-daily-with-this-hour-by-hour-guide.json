        "May 16, 2025 – Ah, spring – baseball is starting, school is ending, and for many, the pollen is really punching. Which means the sneezing and itching and dripping and eye-rubbing make the whole season miserable.",
        "This year, it could be different. If you've had allergies for a while, you have your arsenal of meds, but make sure you have the latest versions. And consider a battle plan that uses the clock wisely.",
        "You probably know how your allergic attacks happen: An allergen binds to certain cells, which release a molecule called histamine. That then binds to receptors that trigger all the symptoms you know about allergic rhinitis – sneezing, a runny nose, red eyes, itching, stuffiness, and more.",
        "Over-the-counter antihistamines block that binding; some are combined with decongestants for those with stuffy noses.",
        "\"The idea is they're going to war against the histamines,\" said David B. Corry, MD, a professor of pathology and immunology and medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine.",
        "First-generation medications like Benadryl can cause drowsiness. But second-gen antihistamines won't – like cetirizine (Zyrtec), fexofenadine (Allegra), and levocetirizine (Xyzal). These newer meds don't cross the blood-brain barrier, which is what causes the sleepiness, Corry said. (Note: Generic versions work just as well as name-brand meds.)"
