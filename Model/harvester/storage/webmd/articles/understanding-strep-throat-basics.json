Symptoms include pain when swallowing, swollen and red tonsils, and fever. Treatment with antibiotics can clear up strep throat within days, easing symptoms, and reducing the risk of strep throat's spread and complications. Left untreated, strep bacteria can travel and cause infection in other areas of your body including your sinuses, tonsils, skin, middle ear, and blood."
