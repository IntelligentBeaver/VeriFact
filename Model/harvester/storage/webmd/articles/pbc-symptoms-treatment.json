Researchers found that people with PBC often have joint pain, which causes them to struggle with chores and other daily tasks and need help more often. People in the study also faced challenges at work and with hobbies and exercise. The study shows that while your quality of life is generally good with PBC, the illness can still have a big impact on your daily life, relationships, and work."

        "Medication can help stop PBC from getting worse and help you avoid further health problems. The first drugs you'll take are: Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (Actigall, Urso). UDCA is the go-to medication for treating PBC. It works by improving the flow of bile through your liver. UDCA is not a cure, but it can help slow liver scarring (fibrosis) and improve liver function. Most people respond well to UDCA, and regular blood tests often show improved liver enzyme levels. However, some people – about 40% – don’t fully respond. And UDCA may not help with symptoms like fatigue or itching, which means some people may need more treatment or second-line therapies to address these gaps. Second-line treatments If UDCA doesn’t bring your liver enzyme levels to normal or causes side effects, your doctor may suggest other medications. These can include: PPAR agonists. These lessen the amount of bile your liver makes. They may improve how well your liver works and can reduce liver injury. You can use them with UDCA, or alone if UDCA doesn't work for you well enough or you can't tolerate it. Some PPAR agonists you may take include: Elafibranor (Iqirvo): Elafibranor targets the PPAR-alpha and PPAR-delta pathways. It’s designed to reduce bile buildup, improve inflammation, and lower liver enzymes such as ALP. It’s usually used with UDCA, especially if you had a poor response to other first-line medications. It also has other benefits, like lowering cholesterol and triglycerides. Seladelpar (Livdelzi): This newer FDA-approved treatment targets the PPAR-delta pathway, which helps reduce liver inflammation and scarring. It can be used if UDCA doesn’t work well or if you can’t take UDCA. Seladelpar is especially helpful if you have intense itching and fatigue, as it supports better sleep and energy levels. It also helps to bring down levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in your blood. This is an enzyme that has a link to the progression of liver disease."
