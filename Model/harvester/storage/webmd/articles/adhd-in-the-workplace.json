        "Excellent focus, attention to detail, speed, and organization are all qualities that employers look for in employees. But when you have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , these skills (and others) can be a real challenge, making it tough to excel at work and sometimes even keep a job. ADHD in adults doesn’t look the same for everyone. You may struggle to stay on task and meet deadlines, or you could find yourself in arguments with a boss or coworker at times.",

        "The symptoms of ADHD fit into two categories: problems with attention, or hyperactive behavior such as restlessness and impulsiveness. Researchers know less about these symptoms in adults because they can be less obvious than those in children, but they might include forgetfulness, having a hard time prioritizing, or not being able to deal with stress.",
        "ADHD can also look different in men and women. Symptoms in men are often more external, such as aggressive behavior, interrupting others, or angry outbursts. However, women’s symptoms tend to be internal. They may feel unmotivated or easily overwhelmed, have a hard time sleeping, or have low self-esteem."
