Rotstein’s group is doing further studies of both the MS prodrome and the prodrome of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the central nervous system. “We're looking at large population-level data from Ontario to see if we can find cases of people who developed MS while they were still negative for EBV. If there are no such cases, then it would increase confidence that EBV is a critical event,” says Rotstein. EBV vaccine trials are underway, but she says the endpoint for those trials will be prevention of  infectious mononucleosis. “We're going to have to find ways to monitor people in the early years after the trial to see if their risk of multiple sclerosis, and possibly other autoimmune diseases, decreases,” says Rotstein. “But that certainly would be very powerful if we could find evidence that this could be a way to prevent multiple sclerosis.”"
