        "By deciding to donate a kidney, you could literally save someone's life. But is it the right choice for you?",
        "While some people may ponder this question after reading about kidney disease or just thinking about ways to make the world a better place, it's most likely to be top of mind when someone you know is in (or headed for) kidney failure. Maybe they have asked if you'd consider donating a kidney, or maybe that person has just started hinting about the need for a donor. Either way, you need to figure out how to respond.",
        "How should you handle such an intense request? And should you actually give up an organ?",
        "These are hard questions, and no one expects you to answer on the spot. In fact, the National Kidney Foundation discourages people in need of a transplant from flat-out asking, \"Will you give me a kidney?\" \"We encourage people to tell their story and talk about what getting a kidney would mean rather than just asking outright,\" says Joseph Vassalotti, MD, the foundation's chief medical officer."
