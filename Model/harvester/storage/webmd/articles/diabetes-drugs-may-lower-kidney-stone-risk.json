        "\"Our results suggest that for patients with type 2 diabetes, the individual risk profile for developing (kidney stones) nephrolithiasis could be a consideration when deciding which glucose-lowering agent patients should initiate,\" wrote authors of a new study, published this month in JAMA Internal Medicine .",

        "The study found the SGLT2 inhibitors showed a 26% lower risk of kidney stones compared to patients taking another class of drugs known as didpeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors. Overall patients on the SGLT2 drugs had a 31% lower risk.",
        "There were no differences in the results based on sex, race, ethnicity, a history of chronic kidney disease, or obesity.",
        "Of note, adults under the age 70 saw a greater risk reduction compared to those over 70, although researchers are not sure why."
