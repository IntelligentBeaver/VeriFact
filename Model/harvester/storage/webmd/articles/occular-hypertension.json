As of 2022, an estimated 3 million people in the United States had glaucoma and more than 120,000 are legally blind because of this disease. These statistics emphasize the need to identify and closely monitor people who are at risk of developing glaucoma, particularly those with ocular hypertension.",

This risk may be decreased to 5% (a 50% decrease in risk) if eye pressure is lowered by medications or laser surgery. However, the risk may become even less than 1% per year because of significantly improved techniques for detecting glaucomatous damage. This could allow treatment to start much earlier, before vision loss occurs.",
        "Patients with thin corneas may be at a higher risk for glaucoma development. Therefore, your eye doctor might measure your corneal thickness.",
        "Over a 5-year period, the incidence of glaucomatous damage in people with ocular hypertension is about 2.6-3% for intraocular pressures of 21-25 mmHg, 12-26% for intraocular pressures of 26-30 mmHg, and approximately 42% for those higher than 30 mmHg.",
        "In approximately 3% of people with ocular hypertension, the veins in the retina can become blocked (called a retinal vein occlusion), which could lead to vision loss. Because of this, keeping pressures below 25 mmHg in people with ocular hypertension and who are older than age 65 is often suggested."
