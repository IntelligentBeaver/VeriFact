Depending on how close and responsive these caregivers were, your attachment style could be secure, anxious, avoidant, disorganized, or another type.",

If you have this attachment style, you may deny the importance of certain feelings or deal with them alone.

        "Also sometimes referred to as a dismissive attachment style, avoidant attachment is an attachment style a child may develop due to either an emotionally absent or overly critical parent. While the parent may provide essentials such as food and shelter, they aren’t able to meet a child’s day-to-day emotional needs.",

People with this attachment style are often described as very independent and self-reliant, to the point where they avoid deep emotional connections with others. One survey of more than 5,000 American adults found that about 20% say they have an avoidant attachment style. Men are more likely to have this style than women."

One study found that a gene mutation in a specific gene called the catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) gene raised the risk of developing avoidant attachment disorder.
