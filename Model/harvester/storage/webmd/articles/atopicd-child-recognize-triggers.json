To avoid this, shop for fragrance-free and dye-free products. Remember that fragrance-free means that no fragrances are added. This is different from unscented, which means that additional chemicals are used to mask odors. Look for products marked with the Seal of Acceptance from the National Eczema Association.

Cleaning chemicals, especially chlorine, can dry out or irritate sensitive skin. To help prevent this, your child can put on moisturizing cream or ointment before they swim or play in the pool, and take a warm shower afterward. Environmental conditions.

After spending time in hot weather or playing sports, your child should rinse off the sweat by taking a warm (not hot) shower.

Pollution in the air, including secondhand tobacco smoke, also can make atopic dermatitis worse. To limit your child’s exposure to airborne outdoor pollutants, check the Air Quality Index, which measures how much pollution is in the air. When it’s over 100, keep windows shut and limit outdoor play. Air pollution inside the home can be as bad as what you’ll find outside. We spend more than 90% of our time indoors, so it’s important to keep the air in our homes as clean as possible. To do this: Don’t smoke indoors. Use a high-efficiency air filter with your HVAC system. Make sure appliances like washers, dryers, and stoves are vented to the outside. Cut down on your use of cleaning products, pesticides, and personal products with dyes and scents, such as soaps and perfume."

If you notice your baby or toddler drooling, gently dab their wet skin with a clean cotton cloth. Avoid rubbing the area, because friction can make AD worse. Ask your child’s doctor about using a thin layer of petroleum jelly to help protect the lips and other affected areas. Some materials, especially wool and synthetic (human-made) fabrics like polyester, can trigger AD. These rashes usually happen in areas where the skin touches tags or seams. Stick with 100% cotton, loose-fitting clothes, and cut off tags to cut down on irritation. Stress. Stress can cause inflammation throughout the body and show up on your skin as rashes or hives. Teach your child how to cope with their emotions. You also can model healthy behaviors and look for support groups for kids with AD.",

This could be a pediatrician, dermatologist (skin doctor), or allergist (allergy doctor). They can help you pinpoint your child’s triggers. Their insight makes a big difference: Kids who get care from an experienced doctor often have fewer symptoms. Keep a diary about your child’s AD. Whenever it flares up, write down what potential triggers your child might have encountered in the past few hours or days. Consider testing your child for allergies. Ask your doctor to check for lesser-known triggers like dyes and preservatives."
