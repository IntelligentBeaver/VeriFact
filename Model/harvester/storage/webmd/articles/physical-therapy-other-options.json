        "Sometimes, simple home interventions are enough to treat cervical disc disease, in which an abnormality in one or more discs that lie between the vertebrae causes neck pain . Often, though, it helps to see a physical therapist who can treat abnormalities, show you how to stretch and strengthen your neck and vertebrae, improve your posture, and prevent neck pain from recurring. You may also consider going to see a chiropractor . In the majority of people, certain exercises and manipulations used by these health care providers can help relieve discomfort and restore movement.",
        "When you visit a physical therapist or chiropractor, you’ll first have a complete evaluation. They will assess how well you can move your neck. You may be asked about symptoms such as pain in the neck or between the shoulder blades, pain that radiates down the arm to the hand or fingers, or numbness or tingling in the shoulder or arm. Your strength, reflexes, and other potential sources of pain will be checked. The therapist or chiropractor will also assess joint function in your neck and back to identify limitations or dysfunctions that may contribute to your pain."
