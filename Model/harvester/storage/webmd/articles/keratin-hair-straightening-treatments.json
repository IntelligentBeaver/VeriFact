The process takes about 90 minutes or longer, depending on your hair's length. Salon keratin products include Keratin Complex Smoothing Therapy by Coppola, Global Keratin Complex, the La-Brasiliana treatment, Brazilian Keratin Treatment, the Brazilian Blowout, and Brazilian Hair Straightening .",
        "Time-Saving Tresses: If you usually style your hair straight, a keratin hair-straightening treatment could shorten your blow-dry time by 40% to 60%, says hair stylist Henri Borday of New York's Mizu salon and corporate educator for Global Keratin.",
        "Farewell, Frizz: You can forget about frizzy hair after treatment. \"You could walk out in moist or light rain and your hair won’t change,\" Borday says.",
        "Wait Before You Wash: You shouldn't wash your hair for three or four days after getting the treatment. That's because the solution takes time to work, he says.",
        "Upkeep: After you get a keratin hair treatment, and after the don't-wash waiting period, you should use sodium - sulfate -free shampoo to help maintain the treatment.",
        "How Long It Lasts: Expect the results to last two to 2 1/2 months."
