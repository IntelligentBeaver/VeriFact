        "The market for products containing cannabidiol, or CBD, has exploded in recent years. Surveys show 14%-33% of U.S. adults have used CBD at some point. People take it for all kinds of health issues, including pain and insomnia , without much hard science to show whether it works. Scientists are studying it as a potential treatment for diseases including Parkinson’s and multiple sclerosis, and mental health conditions including schizophrenia , posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD ), anxiety, and depression. There’s evidence that CBD can offer some help to people who have anxiety or depression. But very little research has been done, and there’s plenty of reason to proceed with caution."

        "Cannabidiol is a chemical compound found in the Cannabis sativa plant, a species that includes both hemp and marijuana . It’s different from the other main compound in cannabis , THC, in the way that it binds to certain receptors in your brain. It doesn’t make you feel “high.” In the U.S., it can be legally manufactured from the hemp plant, and it is sold in many different forms. You can take it by mouth as an oil, a capsule, or a spray, or spread it on your skin as a lotion or oil. It’s added to food, drinks, pet products, and personal items like cosmetics, and it’s even infused into fabric. Depending on your state laws, you can buy it online, in specialty stores, or in your neighborhood grocery or drugstore."

More than a dozen studies have been done on lab animals over the past 3 decades that showed that depending on the dose, CBD could reduce behavior similar to anxiety in people. A handful of studies have been done with people that had similar results. A study published in 2019 showed CBD worked better than a placebo for teenagers with social anxiety. Young people whose regular anxiety medicine wasn’t working well showed improvement after adding CBD in a study published in 2022. Results from the first phase of an ongoing trial using CBD and other cannabis compounds published in 2022 found the medication could ease symptoms over 4 weeks."

          "text": "That’s very much a question to discuss with your doctor. You shouldn’t stop taking any medication you’ve been prescribed without talking with them first. You may need to slowly reduce your dose of certain anxiety and depression medications to avoid side effects. If you do use CBD, or marijuana, to manage depression or anxiety, it’s important to be honest with your doctor about it. A recent survey found that many people take CBD but don’t tell their doctors. That makes it hard to know whether your medical treatment or therapy is helping. And taking CBD with other prescription medicines can change the way they work.",
