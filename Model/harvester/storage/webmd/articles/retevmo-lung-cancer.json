        "Retevmo was studied in 247 people who had RET-positive lung cancer and had previously received platinum-based chemotherapy in a clinical trial called LIBRETTO-001. There were no other medicines used in this group of people. People enrolled in the trial were evaluated to determine the response they had to Retevmo, which was measured by how much their tumor shrank while receiving the medicine. This was called the overall response rate (ORR). The ORR was 64%, meaning that 64% of the patients had a partial or complete response to the medicine. The clinical trial also looked at progression-free survival (PFS), which measured how long it took for the cancer to progress (grow or spread). The median PFS was 16.5 months, which means at least 50% of the people who had a response to Retevmo were still responding at 16.5 months. These numbers can vary, depending on how the clinical trial information is read, and these show how an external health care provider interpreted the results of people who were in the clinical trial. Talk with your health care provider if you have questions about how well Retevmo might work for you.",

People were enrolled in the trial to either receive treatment with Retevmo or with platinum-based chemotherapy with or without a medicine called pembrolizumab. The group of people who did not receive Retevmo were called the control group. This trial also looked at the ORR and PFS. The ORR in the people who received Retevmo was 84%, compared to 65% for the control group. This means that more people who received Retevmo had a complete or partial response, compared to the control group. The median PFS was 24.8 months in the people who received Retevmo, compared to 11.2 months for the control group.
