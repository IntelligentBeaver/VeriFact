        "Upset stomach got you down? Gas, bloating , and bathroom problems are a constant battle for many people -- often the symptoms are related to diet, but there are some more serious medical conditions that may be the culprit.",
        "Most people know that beans, broccoli, and onions can cause gas, but what most people don't suspect are fruits, sodas, and milk. Fructose (a sugar found in fruits and sodas) and lactose (a sugar found in dairy products) are common causes of gas, bloating, abdominal cramps , and diarrhea .",
        "Lactose intolerance is extremely common. It is estimated that 30 to 50 million Americans have some degree of lactose intolerance. Certain racial and ethnic populations are more affected than others, including 75% of African Americans, Jews, Hispanics, and Native Americans, and 90% of Asians.",
        "Fructose intolerance is also common, but less recognized. A study presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology in Seattle by University of Kansas researcher Peter Beyer, RD, finds that nearly half of normal people get gas from fructose. This common fruit sugar is found in fruit juice and is used as a sweetener in some soft drinks."
