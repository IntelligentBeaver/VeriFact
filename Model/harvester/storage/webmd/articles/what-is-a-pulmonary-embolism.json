        "This blockage can cause serious problems such as damage to your lungs and low oxygen levels in your blood. The lack of oxygen can harm other organs in your body, too. If the artery is clogged by a big clot or many smaller clots, it can cause a deadly pulmonary embolism.",

These clots form when the blood can’t flow freely through the legs because your body is still for a long time, such as during a long flight or drive. It might also happen if you’re on bed rest after surgery or illness."
