        "Systemic mastocytosis is a rare blood condition that affects roughly 13 in every 100,000 people. It happens when your body makes too many mast cells — a type of white blood cell that keeps your immune system working properly.",
        "When mast cells detect something harmful, like a virus, they release  a chemical called histamine. Histamine helps your immune system send messages between different cells, but most of us know it as the culprit behind an allergic reaction. In systemic mastocytosis, mast cells release more histamine than they should. Over time, these extra cells can build up in your skin, digestive system or other organs, causing symptoms that often look like an allergic reaction. Depending on where the cells gather, you may also have other symptoms, like stomach ulcers or bone pain.",
        "There are six types of systemic mastocytosis, but the most common form — accounting for about 90% of adult cases — is indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM), which typically causes milder symptoms."

There have also been reports of cognitive changes because the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier.

With these drugs, the mast cell burden goes down, the mast cells change back to a normal shape, and their phenotype — the proteins they express in the surface — normalize. Patients objectively have fewer symptoms and feel better: Their spots go away, their bone pain reduces, they’re able to think clearly, and they have fewer anaphylactic episodes.",
