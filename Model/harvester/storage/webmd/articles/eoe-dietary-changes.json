        "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a lifelong disease that comes back after periods of improvement. To keep symptoms at bay, you’ll need ongoing treatment. One way to help is by making changes to your diet. When you have EoE, white blood cells called eosinophils build up in your esophagus and cause inflammation . Studies show a strong link between food allergies and these surges in white blood cells. If you avoid the foods you’re allergic to, you can reduce your EoE symptoms. In order to know all the foods that may be causing an allergic reaction , you’ll need to take some -- or all -- possible culprits out of your diet and add them back in one at a time to see how your body reacts. Your doctor will call this an elimination diet. Some people only need to remove the most obvious suspects; others require a broader approach. Any kind of dietary approach to EoE should happen under the guidance of health care professionals. Along with your GI doctor, your care team may include a: Registered dietitian Psychologist Feeding and swallowing specialist It may take a long time to figure out which foods are causing your flare-ups, and the process can feel extremely limiting. But, for many people, dietary changes provide real, long-lasting relief from EoE symptoms because they prevent the inflammation from happening in the first place."

After this period, your doctor will do a procedure called an upper endoscopy. They’ll look at your esophagus using a small flexible tube with a camera on the end. And they’ll take a sample (or biopsy ) of cells from the area to get a baseline reading on your inflammation. Then you’ll reintroduce one of the eliminated food groups every 2 to 4 weeks. You’ll have a biopsy with each new food group to see if it increases inflammation."
