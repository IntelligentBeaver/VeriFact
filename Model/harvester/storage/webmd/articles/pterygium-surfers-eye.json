        "Though it's named for a certain type of athlete, this common eye growth can affect anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors.",
        "The main symptom of surfer's eye, or pterygium (pronounced tur-IJ-ee-um), is a triangular growth of pink, fleshy tissue on your conjunctiva. Your conjunctiva is the clear tissue that lines your eyelids and covers the white of your eye. Surfer's eye usually forms on the side closest to your nose (at the 9 o'clock position) and grows across your eye toward your pupil area. It can sometimes grow at the 3 o'clock position, on the outside of your eye, as well.",

        "It can look scary, but it isn't dangerous. The growth might spread slowly during your life or stop after a certain point. In extreme cases, it can cover your pupil and may cause vision problems.",
        "The growth could show up in one eye or both. When it affects both, it's known as a bilateral pterygium.",
        "Though it isn't usually a serious condition, it can cause annoying symptoms. You might feel like you have something in your eye. Or it may get red and irritated and require medical or surgical treatment. You might also feel self-conscious because people may ask you about your eye being red all the time."

You get a pinguecula the same way as a pterygium—lots of time outside in the sun and wind without eye protection. But pingueculae don't usually cause symptoms, and they don't need to be removed."
