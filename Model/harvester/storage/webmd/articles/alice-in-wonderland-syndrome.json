It can impact the way you see your own body, the world around you, or both. For example, objects, people, or your own body parts may look larger or smaller than they really are. AIWS can warp your sense of time and reality, too. It’s a brain (neurological) condition, not a mental health condition.",

        "Migraine. One of the most common causes of AIWS is migraine. You can get AIWS with a migraine aura — the phase before or during a migraine when your brain takes in sights, sounds, or sensations differently.",
        "“We now understand that migraines are more than just headaches,” says Hamid Djalilian, MD, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. Migraines are closely tied to brain inflammation and affect how your brain interprets information from your senses. When your brain is inflamed, it can misread signals from your eyes or body. That can cause the size and shape distortions typical of AIWS. If your child child has Alice in Wonderland syndrome, it may sometimes (but not always) be an early sign they’ll have migraines later in life, Djalilian says.",
        "You can also get AIWS with other types of headaches, such as abdominal migraines (sudden, serious episodes of belly pain) and cluster headaches."
