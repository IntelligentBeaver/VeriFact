        "The first person to describe trench foot was a surgeon in Napoleon’s army. It became common in World War I, when soldiers would stand for hours in muddy trenches. Later, during World War II, shipwrecked sailors would get it after spending time in lifeboats that were full of water. Trench foot made a comeback among troops during the Falkland Islands conflict of 1982.",
