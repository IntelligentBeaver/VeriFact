        "Nov. 13, 2023 – People with heart disease who took the weight loss medicine Wegovy were significantly less likely to have a heart attack or stroke, results of a much anticipated study show.",
        "People in the study took the medicine – which has the same active ingredient as the diabetes drug Ozempic – for nearly 3 years on average and were followed for a total of 5 years. During that time, 6.5% of people who took Wegovy had a major heart event or died of heart disease, compared to 8% of people in the study who took a placebo treatment. The difference is the equivalent of a 20% reduced risk of heart attack, stroke, or death due to heart disease.",
        "The results were published Saturday in The New England Journal of Medicine , and presented at the same time to a standing-room-only audience at a medical conference in Philadelphia, The New York Times reported . The study included 17,604 people age 45 or older who had heart disease and were overweight or obese, but did not have diabetes. The average starting weight of people in the study was around 212 pounds."
