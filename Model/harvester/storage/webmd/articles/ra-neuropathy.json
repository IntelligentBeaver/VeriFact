        "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease where your immune system attacks the joints, places where two bones meet, across your body. This causes damage and inflammation in your joints that can be painful and affect your daily life. Sometimes symptoms will pop up elsewhere and change. One common complication of RA is peripheral neuropathy. That’s when the swelling and irritation that come with RA can lead to nerve damage. But how do you know if you have it? And does it matter if your RA is mild, moderate, or severe?"

        "RA can hurt your peripheral nerves, which are part of the peripheral nervous system. That’s the communication system that helps your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) send and receive information throughout your body. Most often this damage happens in your hands and feet. Usually this condition, called peripheral neuropathy, results from your nerves being compressed in RA. This can happen because of an inflamed joint (synovitis), an inflamed tendon ( tenosynovitis ), or partial dislocation of a joint. Very rarely it’s caused by rheumatoid nodules, which are lumps or masses under the skin.",

The earlier you know your diagnosis, the earlier you can get treatment that may slow down or repair your nerve damage. It can take months or even years to heal. Whether or not you’ll fully recover depends on the type of neuropathy you have and what’s causing it. If your RA is more serious, it’s possible that your nerves may have some sort of permanent damage. If that’s the case, your best options are to find ways to control your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Yet there is some hope even in these cases: studies are exploring treatments that might one day be able to restore your nerves to health."

If your symptoms are mild to moderate and have lasted less than 10 months, wrist splinting and self-care may be enough to make them go away. You can use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce your pain, but there’s no evidence they actually treat your carpal tunnel syndrome. For very bad symptoms, your doctor can inject your nerve with a corticosteroid. That will lessen both inflammation and swelling. Similarly, treating the RA itself could potentially offer relief. And finally, if symptoms are especially bad, surgery can be done to release your pinched nerve."
