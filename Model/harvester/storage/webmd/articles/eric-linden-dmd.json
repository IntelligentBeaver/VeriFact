        "Eric Linden, DMD, is a periodontist (gum disease specialist) in the field of laser periodontal surgery, which includes LANAP, periodontics, regeneration, and dental implants. He has been practicing his specialty since 1985.",
        "Linden was one of the first practitioners to perform the FDA-cleared LANAP protocol on the East Coast. With 26 years’ experience in periodontal specialty practice, he now performs LANAP and other laser procedures every day. He has treated thousands of patients with the laser and in many cases includes traditional techniques when necessary. Since 1988, Linden has also been placing dental implants and using an innovative conservative sinus augmentation technique that he perfected.",
        "Linden's patients are referrals from other dentists, periodontists, medical professionals, and educated patients seeking the most advanced and least invasive techniques available to treat gum disease. When he’s not treating patients, Linden travels around the country lecturing on the topic of laser periodontal surgery.",
