        "Uplizna (inebilizumab-cdon) is a prescription medicine recently approved by the FDA to treat adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who test positive for certain antibodies — either anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or anti-muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies. The approval provides a new treatment that may help control the disease long term with just two doses per year through an intravenous (IV) infusion after two initial loading doses.",
        "gMG is a long-term autoimmune condition that disrupts how nerves and muscles communicate, leading to muscle weakness that comes and goes and can make walking, talking, swallowing, or breathing harder. The disease is caused by the immune system producing specific antibodies (anti-AChR and anti-MuSK autoantibodies) that attack the connections between nerves and muscles. About 80,000 to 100,000 people in the U.S. live with MG, and most of them (about 85%) have the generalized form.",
        "Uplizna is a monoclonal antibody that works by targeting and removing certain immune cells known as CD19-positive B cells that produce the harmful antibodies responsible for the condition. By removing these cells, this medicine may help reduce symptoms and prevent flare-ups. First approved in 2020, Uplizna is also used to treat other rare autoimmune diseases in adults, including neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and immunoglobulin G4-related disease.",
        "What makes Uplizna different is that it’s the first FDA-approved treatment for gMG that specifically targets CD19-positive B cells. It requires less frequent dosing, which may be more convenient than other therapies that require regular administration."
