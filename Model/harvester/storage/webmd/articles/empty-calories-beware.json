Yet some foods are full of calories and fat but lacking in any nutrition. These are called \"empty calories.\" Empty as well as excess calories make you gain weight. But empty calories don't offer any of the vitamins, minerals, protein, and fiber your body needs to run at its best. Soda, potato chips, and cookies are examples of foods with empty calories. Their calories mainly come from added sugar and solid fats like butter and shortening. They may taste good, but they're not good for you."

Empty calories are foods and drinks that basically are just fat and sugar. They don't contain much, if any, of the nutrients your body needs to work properly. You don't gain any health benefits from eating them, and they can increase your weight. In contrast, foods that are nutrient-dense for their calorie count help you stay at a healthy weight."

Foods that contain empty calories, like cookies and snack chips, are also highly addictive. Their sweetness, saltiness, and satisfying crunch activate the reward centers in your brain.
