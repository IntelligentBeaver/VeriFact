        "Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES), also called Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), is a rare autoimmune disease that disrupts the nerve signals that tell your muscles to move. This causes your legs, arms, and sometimes face to become weak. Most doctors and researchers call it Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome rather than Lambert-Eaton syndrome. Myasthenia means muscle weakness, so they believe that including the word makes the name more accurate.",
        "Fewer than 3 million people around the world have LES, including only 400 people in the U.S. About 50% to 60% of people with LES also have small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), although they might not have been diagnosed yet. It's possible to have symptoms of Lambert-Eaton syndrome up to six years before SCLC is discovered. Muscle weakness could be the clue that leads your doctor to a lung cancer diagnosis. Some experts say that LES might be underdiagnosed in this group. This means more people may have it and not know it."
