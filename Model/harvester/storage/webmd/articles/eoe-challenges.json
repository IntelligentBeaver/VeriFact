        "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a condition that causes an allergic reaction in your esophagus -- the tube that carries food from your throat to your stomach. When you're exposed to a trigger like food or pollen, your esophagus produces white blood cells called eosinophils as if it were reacting to an infection. These cells release chemicals that make your esophagus become inflamed and swell up. Swelling and narrowing of the esophagus can slow or even block the movement of food and liquids through it. This causes symptoms like trouble swallowing, vomiting, and belly pain. Having EoE adds a few challenges to your life, but you can manage them with some help from your medical team."

GERD happens when the muscle at the bottom of your esophagus doesn't close all the way. That open valve allows acid from your stomach to back up and irritate the lining of your esophagus."
