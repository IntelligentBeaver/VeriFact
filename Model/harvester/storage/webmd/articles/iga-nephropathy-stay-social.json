        "IgA nephropathy is hard to predict. But there’s one thing experts know. People with strong emotional and social support systems tend do better in the long run. And it’s best to live your life to the fullest no matter how kidney disease affects you. “Whether it’s skiing or knitting or going to football games as a group, it’s important to maintain as much of your regular life as you can,” says Susan Rubman, PhD, a medical psychologist with Yale Medicine. “That’s what allows us to feel like we’re whole people rather than a person with an illness.” Keep your doctor in the loop about daily challenges. Let them know if you feel like depression or anxiety are closing you off from the outside world. Along with your help from your medical team, you can take steps to stay connected."

        "“It can be isolating if you’re experiencing symptoms or limitations that folks just don’t understand,” Rubman says. For example, you might be on a low-sodium diet , have to limit your fluid intake, or need long-term dialysis . You may worry about needing a kidney transplant one day, or maybe you’ve already had one. You may feel more at ease when you talk to folks faced with similar health issues. That’s called peer support, and studies show it can benefit people with all kinds of health conditions. There’s more than one way to find people who share your condition or a similar one. One place to start is your doctor’s office. Ask if you can talk to a patient educator or patient advocate. Rubman’s clinic offers meetings with “ambassadors.” Those are other folks with firsthand knowledge of life with chronic kidney disease, including those on dialysis or who’ve had a transplant."

And it’s important that you’re willing to ask for help along the way. Chances are your friends and family are ready and willing to pitch in. “When people really love one another, one of the biggest things they get happiness from is being able to support someone they care about in their time of need,” Duggan says. “You don’t need to take that responsibility away from someone.” Your emotional health goes up and your odds of depression and anxiety go down when you have caring people in your life. But social support is good in practical ways. For instance, you may need help with your meds, getting a ride to dialysis, or remembering all the complex info your doctor tells you. Later on, caregivers and social supports can be even more critical. “Because that’s a vital piece of the transplant process,” Rubman says."
