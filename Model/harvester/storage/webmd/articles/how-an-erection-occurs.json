A man or person assigned male at birth (AMAB) must ejaculate in order to transfer sperm to a female partner for the purpose of reproduction; that is, having a baby. When you ejaculate, you have an orgasm, which causes your brain to release several different chemicals that leave you feeling great -- relaxed and at peace. Orgasms act like a reward for ejaculating, which makes you want to do it again. Since humans need to keep having sex for the species to survive, evolution ensured that ejaculation feels good."
