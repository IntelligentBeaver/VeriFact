After a strong audition, a teacher told her to lose weight. The message that body size mattered more than skill pushed her out of the dance studio for years.",
        "In college, Diaz-Herrera rediscovered dance. She joined and led a hip-hop crew, built an inclusive dance community, and in 2016, launched the Body Positive Dance Class.  She’s now CEO and co-founder of Power Plus Wellness, a wellness company that creates private movement classes and other experiences for people with larger bodies.",

Multiple scientific studies show other physical and mental health benefits of moving your body through dance."
