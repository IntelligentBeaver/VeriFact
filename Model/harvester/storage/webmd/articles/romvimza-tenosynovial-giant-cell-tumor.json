By blocking CSF1R, Romvimza stops the signal to recruit these inflammatory cells and helps decrease symptoms of TGCT."

        "Romvimza was studied in people who had TGCT that would be made worse by surgery. People in this trial got either Romvimza or a placebo twice a week. The study looked at objective response rate (ORR) at week 25, which measured how effective Romvimza was by looking at the percentage of people who had either a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) to Romvimza. A CR is when all of the tumor has disappeared and a PR is when the tumor has decreased in size by at least 30%. The study also looked at the range of motion (ROM) response rate, which measured how much the ROM was improved after treatment, and change from baseline in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-Physical Function (PROMIS-PF) scores and response of at least a 30% improvement in the mean Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Worst Pain numeric rating scale (NRS). The PROMIS-PF and BPI are both patient reported measures that help to assess how well people can perform their daily living activities and how bad their pain is. There were 123 people in this study and there were twice as many people in the Romvimza group. The median age was 44 (range 20 to 78). Fifty-nine percent of people were female and 41% were male. Sixty-five percent of people were White, 4% were Asian, 3% were Black or African American, and 28% were not reported or unknown. The majority of people (74%) had prior surgery, and most of the people in this trial had TGCT that was located in their knee (67%), ankle (12%), or hip (10%).",
        "People who got Romvimza had a significantly better response rate compared to placebo. Forty percent of people in the Romvimza group had a response, and of those people, 35% had a PR and 5% had a CR. This means that 40% of people had their tumor shrink by at least 30%. More people in the Romvimza group also saw improvements in their ROM than in the placebo group (18.4% vs. 3.8%). In addition, people taking Romvimvza had a significant improvement in PROMIS-PF (43% vs. 25%) and BPI-30 worst pain (48% vs. 23%) scores, which means they saw improvement in both their physical functioning and pain."

Edema happens when the fluid from your blood vessels leak into a tissue and cause swelling. There are some things you can do to decrease your swelling and help with your symptoms. You can avoid eating foods that are high in salt, since salt can increase your swelling. You can wear compression stockings to help with swelling in your legs and feet. You can try raising the part of your body that is swollen above your heart several times a day. Ask your health care provider about exercises that may help decrease your swelling.
