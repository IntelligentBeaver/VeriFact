        "For new parents, bath time can be daunting, with all that water and a slippery, wiggly baby. Eileen Costello, MD, a pediatrician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, helps new moms and dads understand how to keep their baby well-washed and safe.",
        "\"For newborns, until the umbilical cord comes off, which can take up to 3 weeks, a warm sponge bath on a clean towel on the floor is the best way to start,\" Costello says.",
        "Once the cord comes off, the baby can graduate to a tub that fits in the sink. But for both situations, safety comes first. \"Never take your hand off her, and never walk away for even a second,\" Costello says. \"That’s all it takes for a baby to slip or slide, or worse, fall.\"",
        "Bath time shouldn’t come every day. \"Babies don’t sweat, and they really don’t get dirty,\" Costello says. \"So you only need to give your baby a bath two to three times a week.\" Nor does it have to last very long. While giving her extra time in the tub may seem as though you’re adding moisture, it can irritate and dry out your baby’s skin . So can some lotions, so you can skip those, too."
