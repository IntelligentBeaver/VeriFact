        "To prevent falls associated with osteoporosis, it is essential to build strength, improve balance, and make minor adjustments at home. Regular exercise, wearing proper shoes, regular eye checks, and maintaining clutter-free spaces can all help reduce the risk of falls and fractures In the United States, 1.5 million fractures due to falls are reported in people with osteoporosis each year. Many of these fractures can be avoided if you adopt habits that strengthen your bones and improve your quality of life. These seven simple actions can help you reduce your risk of falls."

If you have osteoporosis, choose footwear with: A wide base, firm soles, and low heels to keep your foot stable. Good arch support and cushioning to absorb impact while walking. “Avoid wearing footwear such as flip-flops, slippers, or worn-out or slippery shoes; they are not recommended if you have osteoporosis,” Bonilla says."
