        "Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare blood disorder. Your immune system mistakenly destroys platelets, cell fragments that help your blood clot after an injury. The lack of platelets can make you bruise or bleed more easily. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is an older name for this condition.",

        "The blood clots can also block the flow of blood to your organs like the brain, heart, or kidneys. Too much clotting can also use up the platelets you need to stop the bleeding when you're hurt.",
