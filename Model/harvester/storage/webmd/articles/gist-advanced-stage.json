        "Advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a rare disease of the digestive tract. Also known as GISTs for short, many of these tumors grow slowly and don’t cause problems. But if you have advanced GISTs, tumors may spread fast and can be life-threatening. Around 10% to 20% of people with GISTs are diagnosed when they already have metastatic disease. That’s when the original cancer cells spread to other parts of the body.But some people with advanced GISTs have multiple primary tumors in different places. There’s no cure for advanced GISTs, but your doctor can help you find treatment to feel better and live as long as possible."

Advanced GIST is considered a chronic (long-term) cancer. That usually means you’ll need medical care for the rest of your life. You might get targeted drugs or other therapies to slow your cancer or ease symptoms caused by the tumors. You may need to check in with your doctor every 3 to 6 months. During these visits, they may go over how you’re feeling or run tests to look at your cancer. They may also go over a long-term strategy for how to handle life with cancer. You may hear this called a survivorship care plan. Here are some questions to get you started: Can I get a schedule for when I’ll need follow-up exams or other tests? Which tests will I need to check for long-term health problems from cancer or treatment? Will I need tests for other kinds of cancer? What late or lasting side effects may come from my treatment? Who can I talk to for diet and exercise tips?"
