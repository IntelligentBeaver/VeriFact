        "However, asbestos fibers can cause serious lung problems if you breathe them in. That's led to bans on the use of the mineral in more than 60 countries, including, recently, the U.S.",
        "Asbestos history",
        "Modern commercial production in North America began in the late 1800s and had its heyday during and after World War II. It was commonly used in building materials for homes, schools, and businesses, as well as in shipbuilding, automotive parts, and even textiles.",
        "After the health risks became widely understood in the 1970s, worker safety rules were put in place and the use of asbestos started dropping. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), only one part of the chemical industry still uses it as a raw material. It's also in newly imported brake parts and a handful of other industrial products."
