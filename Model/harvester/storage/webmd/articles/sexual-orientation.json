        "Sexual orientation vs. sex",
        "Sex refers to the physical traits a person is born with, like their chromosomes, hormones, and body parts, which normally categorize people as male, female or intersex (a mix of male and female traits). By comparison, sexual orientation is about who someone feels romantically or sexually attracted to, and how they see themselves based on those feelings.",

        "Sexual orientation and gender are two different parts of a person’s identity. While sexual orientation describes who a person is attracted to, gender refers to a person’s sense of who they are internally. Gender is a spectrum: Some people feel like a woman, some feel like a man, and others may feel like both, neither, or somewhere in between. A person’s gender might not match their sex."
