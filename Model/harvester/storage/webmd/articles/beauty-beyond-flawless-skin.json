        "In a world often dictated by beauty standards, being a Black woman living with eczema has left me on a transformative journey of self-discovery and redefining what beauty means beyond conventional norms. My skin, with all its beauty marks, tells a story that transcends the constraints of societal norms.",
        "Eczema, rather than a flaw, became a testament to the strength and beauty inherent in my skin. From magazines to social media, the portrayal of flawless, airbrushed skin has long been the standard. I’ve learned to challenge and redefine these ideals. Imperfections do not diminish my beauty; instead, they contribute to my story of resilience and authenticity.",
        "The beauty industry has historically lacked representation, often failing to acknowledge the diverse needs of Black women. Living with eczema has made me a fierce advocate for inclusivity. I know there are millions of other people who, just like me, haven’t been the most confident in their skin. One way to challenge the norm is by speaking up and living in your truth, hoping that your story touches someone who resonates with you. This keeps the conversation going, thus, opening doors for us. There is power in embracing all of you, even the parts you don’t love yet."

        "Eczema, although unpredictable, often disrupts the conventional skin care routines that dominate beauty culture. Rather than viewing this as a setback, I’ve learned to redefine my relationship with skin care. It’s not just about achieving a flawless complexion; it’s about nurturing and caring for my skin’s unique needs. Each flare-up is an opportunity for self-care, an acknowledgment of my need to slow down and listen to my body.",

Redefining beauty standards involves advocating for inclusive formulations that cater to the specific needs of black eczema-prone skin. I’m hopeful that as more people open up on their respective platforms, beauty companies will take note and explore the idea of expanding their products.",
        "True beauty extends far beyond the surface. Eczema has taught me that confidence is not contingent on having flawless skin. It’s about embracing my authentic self, scars, and all. By redefining my beauty standards, I’ve found a profound sense of self-worth."
