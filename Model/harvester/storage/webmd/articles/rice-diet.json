        "The Rice Diet is a low-fat, low-salt diet. Because sodium is an appetite stimulant, cutting back curbs your hunger. You’ll also fill up on high-fiber foods, so you’ll feel satisfied with fewer calories, say the authors.",
        "The diet has three phases:",
        "Phase 1 (detox mode). You’ll eat 800 calories a day. On the first day, you’ll stick with starches, such as rice, bread, pasta, or potatoes, and fruit. Over the next six days, you can add beans, vegetables, and non-fat milk. You’ll get 300-500 milligrams of sodium per day.",
        "Phase 2 (weight loss mode). You’ll average about 1,000 calories and 300-500 milligrams of sodium each day. You’ll eat fruit and starches for one day, followed by five days of fruit, starches, beans, vegetables, and non-fat milk. On the seventh day, you’ll add fish, dairy, eggs, or lean meat.",
        "Phase 3 (maintenance mode). This phase is the same as phase 1, but you’ll add 200 more calories per week until you reach your goal weight. You can also add tofu, cheese, nuts, seeds, olives, and olive oil. Sodium is increased to 500-1,000 milligrams per day.",
        "Instead of counting calories, the Rice Diet breaks down its meals into portions. For example, one starch is 1/2 cup cooked grains, pasta, or starchy vegetables, and one fruit is 1 medium-sized whole fruit or 1 cup of fruit."

The food on the plan doesn’t give you enough calcium and vitamin D, so you will need supplements. Also, the plan offers much less protein than what’s recommended for healthy people. If you have a medical condition, check with your doctor before starting this diet.",
        "All the food groups are fair game, but portion sizes count. One day a week on the plan, you’ll eat only starches and fruit. The rest of the time, you can eat a variety of whole foods. The plan also recommends you skip alcohol, coffee, and caffeinated sodas.",
        "You’ll shop and cook for most of your meals. “It’s difficult to follow the plan in restaurants,” Woods says. The recommended foods are available at any grocery store. The book contains a healthy grocery list to help you stock up on the right foods, drinks, and seasonings. The Rice Diet Solution features weekly meal plans, plus suggested recipes that take time to prep and cook. Because the plan limits fat and sodium, you’ll cook with no or very little salt. They’re usually cooked with a small amount of extra-virgin olive oil.",
        "Because processed and packaged foods are often high in sodium and fat, they typically don’t fit into the Rice Diet. But the book recommends some items, such as certain cereals, crackers, and no-salt-added canned soups.",
        "You follow the Rice Diet on your own, so there are no in-person meetings.",
        "The plan recommends regular exercise, such as walking and yoga. Because the diet is low in calories and electrolytes , use caution if you work out a lot or for long periods, says Woods. Talk to your doctor before you try the Rice Diet."
