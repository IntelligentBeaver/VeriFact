        "One way to help make eating out with EPI a successful experience is proper at-home preparation. Eat first . Eat a snack or light meal before you go, so you aren’t so hungry that you let your guard down. Otherwise, you could wind up devouring deep-fried mozzarella sticks (or other foods that aren’t likely to sit well). Choose a high-protein snack that will help keep you satisfied longer, so that you don’t arrive famished. Keep pills cool . Pack your enzyme replacement pills in a bag or secure container. If it’s a hot day, be sure you don’t store them in a stuffy glove compartment or in the sun. Heat is kryptonite for PERT (Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy) and can make your valuable and vital medication ineffective. (Temps 77 F and warmer are bad news; room temperature is best.) Pack supplies. If you have a hard time swallowing pills and take them by mixing what’s inside the capsule in a spoonful of applesauce, gelatin , or yogurt , bring these items with you. Also consider packing extra beverages, such as a bottle of water to swallow pills with, in case your server doesn’t refill your glass in time."
