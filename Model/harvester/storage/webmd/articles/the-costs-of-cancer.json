        "Cancer can also be financially expensive. When one has to go to doctors’ appointments or have surgeries or procedures, they will likely have to use sick or personal time from work. If they exhaust  leave time, their paycheck may be reduced or they may not get paid at all. If they’re an entrepreneur, they may not be able to meet the demands of their clients. This will impact their stream of income.",

Maybe they’ll have to tap into their retirement plan, savings account, or the equity in their home.  Some may have to take out personal loans. Even if they have health insurance, they may still have to cover various copays for visits or medicine. With mounting medical bills and other living expenses, some survivors may be forced to file for bankruptcy or max out their credit cards."
