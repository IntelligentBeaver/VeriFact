        "Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) inflames and damages the tiny bile ducts in your liver. This causes your digestive fluids (bile) to build up and damage your liver. Without treatment, PBC can lead to liver scarring called cirrhosis. Fortunately, there are medicines to treat the disease. With your doctor's help, you can create a treatment plan that will slow PBC and control your symptoms. But treating primary biliary cholangitis often takes some trial and error. The first medicine you take might not work for you. Knowing what to expect from your treatment will help you be a more involved member of your care team. And if the first medicine you try doesn't work, it's time to have a conversation with your doctor about making changes to your treatment plan."

When your doctor prescribes a new medicine or makes any changes to your plan, find out as much as you can about it. Here are a few questions you might ask: What tests will you use to monitor my disease progression and liver health? What treatments do you recommend? How will they help? What side effects could I have with the medicine, and how can I relieve them? What are my other treatment options? What can I take to manage PBC symptoms? What dietary changes do you recommend? Should I take supplements? Which ones? How will they help me? What complications might I develop? How will I know if I have them? How severe is my liver damage? Will I need a liver transplant? Where can I find support?",

Medicines work well at slowing primary biliary cholangitis, but you may need to be patient. It can take a few months to see improvements, and it could require some trial and error. Not everyone will get better with the first drug they try. UDCA helps more than half of the people who take it. The rest either won't improve or they'll stop taking the drug because of side effects. Many people live full, normal lives with PBC. But the course of this disease can be unpredictable. It's hard to know whether your disease will progress slowly, or if you'll develop cirrhosis quickly. Your doctor might not know all the answers. It's OK to ask for a second opinion if you're not getting answers or the results you expected."
