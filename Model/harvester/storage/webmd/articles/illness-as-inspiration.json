        "Many of the world's great creative geniuses and political leaders are remembered to this day by the works and legacies they achieved during times of personal illness, notes Paul Wolf, MD, a researcher at the University of California and VA Medical Centers in San Diego. \"Illness can profoundly affect the productivity and creativity of those who are ill,\" he tells WebMD.",

A lot of people who have had tragedy in their personal lives undergo a very creative period when they come out of tragedy. Creation replaces the loss.\""

Also, it's likely that Ludwig von Beethoven began to lose his hearing at the age of 28, due to a condition called Paget's disease of the bone. By age 44, he was completely deaf -- yet went on to compose some of his most memorable symphonies.",
