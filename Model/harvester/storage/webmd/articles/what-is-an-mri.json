        "Both tests let a doctor see inside your body to diagnose a condition or how you're responding to a treatment. Both procedures require you to lie on a table and go inside a circular scanner while a technician goes into another room to take the images. But the tests have different purposes.",
        "CT ( computed tomography ) scans combine X-rays with computer technology. They're used mainly to look at structures deep inside your body like tumors or bone fractures, or for when doctors need to make an emergency diagnosis, as results can be had in as little as 10 minutes. CT scans are cheaper than MRIs, too.",
        "MRIs provide more details than a CT scan but results take longer -- maybe 1 hour. MRIs are used to diagnose problems like torn ligaments, inflammation, or spinal issues. It's especially useful for looking at soft tissues (like organs and muscles) and the nervous system. Unlike X-rays and CT scans, MRIs don’t use damaging radiation."

        "The MRI is basically a tube-shaped magnet. While you're inside the machine, protons from water in your body get pulled into the magnetic field around you and start to line up. The machine also sends out radio waves that cause these protons to spin. When the waves are turned off, the atoms lineup again. As they line up, they send out radio signals. A computer receives these and converts them into an image of the body part being looked at. This image shows up on a screen.",

It can leave a metallic taste in your mouth.",
        "Most MRIs are performed without a contrast dye because it isn't needed to get accurate results for the suspected problem. Also, certain patients (those who are pregnant as well as those with kidney disease ) shouldn't get the contrast dye because of possible complications."
