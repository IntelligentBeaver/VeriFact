        "By Sharon Solomon, MD, as told to Keri Wiginton Geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced dry form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Up to 20% of folks with AMD may get it. While we see GA across all populations and races, it’s more common in older folks who have a family history of AMD and those of European descent. GA tends to progress incredibly slowly, but it can be devastating for the subset of people who get it. However, the FDA recently approved the first drug for GA. And I expect we’ll see more options down the line. I want people to know that it’s rare to go completely blind from this condition. GA doesn’t affect your side vision, and you’ll be able to look around in the morning, get dressed, and take care of yourself. Again, I want to reassure folks, even those with late-stage disease, that it’s possible to maintain your independence with GA. Other eye diseases may make it hard to tell the difference between night and day. This isn’t that."

        "People who have GA lose light-sensitive cells and tissue in the retina. This thinning, or atrophy, tends to occur very close to the center of the back part of your eye or macula. You use this area to read, drive, and focus directly on any fine detail. For example, when you look at the word “the,” you use the central part of your macula called the fovea to focus on the “h” in the center. Often, geography atrophy occurs in this area. People often tell me they can’t see letters when they try to read. As the atrophy grows, whole words may disappear. And in severe cases, they can’t read anything on the page because everything they focus on is in this blank area. We call that missing part of the visual field a scotoma. If you have a loved one with GA, it can be hard to grasp what they’re going through. Relatives often tell me they don’t understand why their loved one says they have vision trouble. They know their mom can see because they’ve watched her pick up a pen, get dressed, or put on makeup."
