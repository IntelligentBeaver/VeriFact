        "March 20, 2000 (San Francisco) -- Six years ago, Vietnam veteran John Mulligan was a homeless \"shopping cart soldier\" in San Francisco's North Beach, a man wracked with flashbacks and numbed by post-traumatic stress disorder. But his life took a turn during a veteran's writing workshop conducted by noted author Maxine Hong Kingston.",
        "At the first workshop, Mulligan wrote about a horrific scene from the war: his buddies turning their weapons on a water buffalo for fun, sport, and misplaced revenge. The blood , the noise, the sense of loss and waste were all there.",
        "Mulligan, now a 49-year-old novelist, left the workshop so elated he was \"whistling and skipping.\" In the following years, he repeatedly discovered that putting past horrors into words helped clear his mind and lift his spirits. \"I had to face my demons,\" he says. \"I was an empty shell walking around the street, and writing made me feel like I had a soul.\"",
        "Souls may be beyond the reach of science, but many researchers echo Mulligan's conclusion: Writing about stressful events can be powerfully therapeutic for body and mind."

He would sit at cafeteria tables and park benches filling his notebook with horrific images, often pausing to take a break when the memories grew too upsetting. For Mulligan, writing was always a struggle, but it was also a matter of survival. \"Writing gives me a reprieve from the darkness of life,\" says the author, whose first novel, Shopping Cart Soldiers, was published in 1997.",

Without regard to sentence structure or grammar, people should try to describe their traumas and explain their feelings, he says."
