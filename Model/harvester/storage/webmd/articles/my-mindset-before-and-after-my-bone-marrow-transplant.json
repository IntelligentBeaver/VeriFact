        "When I had my bone marrow transplant, I was the very first person to receive a transplant under that particular study (the Stride-HCT bone marrow transplant study). The Stride-HCT transplant stands for sickle cell transplantation to prevent disease exacerbation in young adults. At that time in 2012, I didn’t know and hadn’t been introduced to anyone who had ever been cured of sickle cell disease.",
        "Although your doctors may try to connect you with other patients who have gone through a bone marrow transplant, probably no one in the group will have had your disease or have gone through your same struggles. When I was going through my transplant, my doctors wanted to connect me with other patients who had battled various types of cancer.",
        "They also wanted to connect my parents to caregivers of transplant patients. I declined their offer because, in my head, they didn’t understand what I had gone through to get to this point in my life where I needed a transplant. They would not understand my exact fears of dealing with sickle cell disease and the fear of my body rejecting my transplant."

I believe I would not be alive today had I not had a bone marrow transplant. It was my family who helped me decide to receive transplantation. The way that I was able to get through the transplant was to go into it mentally telling myself and believing that it would work."
