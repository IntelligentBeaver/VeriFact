        "Cradle cap is a common skin condition in newborns and babies that causes rough patches on their scalp. It's also known as infantile seborrheic dermatitis, crusta lacteal, honeycomb disease, milk crust, pityriasis capitis, and crib cap.",
        "It usually develops when a baby is 1 to 3 months old. About 70% of 3-month-old babies have cradle cap. Most of the time, it goes away within 1 year. But some babies develop it around 1 or 2 years old",

        "When you see these rough patches on your baby’s head, you might worry that it’s something serious. Cradle cap is common and harmless. It’s the baby form of dandruff.",
        "This skin condition got its name because the most common place for the scaly patches to show up is on the head, where a baby would wear a cap.",
        "You can usually get rid of it in a few simple steps. Even if you don’t do anything, it should go away on its own with time."
