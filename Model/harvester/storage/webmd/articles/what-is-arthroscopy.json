        "Arthroscopic surgery is a type of minor surgery that doctors use to look inside a joint and often fix any problems they see at the same time. It’s done on an outpatient basis, which means you can go home the same day. Your doctor may recommend it if you have joint pain, inflammation , an injury, or damage that has built up over time.",
        "You can have arthroscopic surgery on any joint, but it’s most often done on the knee , shoulder , elbow , ankle , hip, or wrist.",
        "During the procedure, your doctor will make a few small cuts near the joint, then insert a tool called an arthroscope — a long, thin tube equipped with a video camera and a light. The arthroscope is connected to a monitor, which displays images of the joint so your doctor can get a better look. If they see something that needs to be fixed, they can usually repair it during the same surgery by passing thin surgical tools through the same cuts."
