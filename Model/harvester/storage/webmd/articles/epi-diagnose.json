        "When you have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), you probably know your body doesn’t feel right. Still, it’s not always easy for doctors to diagnose your condition. The classic symptoms of EPI -- weight loss, greasy and foul-smelling stools that float or are tough to flush, stomach cramps, and diarrhea -- mimic the telltale signs of many other digestive diseases. You might even have one of those diseases along with EPI, like Crohn’s or celiac disease . That makes it hard for doctors to know exactly which condition is causing you trouble. To add to the confusion , not everyone with EPI has the same classic symptoms. Other warning signs can be too subtle for you to notice. To figure out what’s going on, your doctor will use tests to see how many nutrients your body is absorbing from food. Here’s a rundown of the tests they might use. Your doctor will take a sample of your blood and send it to a lab to check it for anemia , a condition in which your body doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells. The lab will also test your blood for vitamin B12, iron, and folate . If the levels are too low, that can mean EPI is keeping your body from absorbing these nutrients."
