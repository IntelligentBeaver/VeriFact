I do have a physical disability: a hypermobility spectrum disorder. It means some of my joints bend way past a normal range of motion , and I live with chronic pain . But I also consider my mental illness -- major depressive disorder (MDD) ­-- a disability, and I talk about it as a disability. I think solidarity with this community is important. We support each other and advocate better for disability rights when we stand together."

        "I had a job that was really exhausting, and some tense work relationships started giving me panic attacks . When I asked to work from home 2 days a week, just to give myself space to get things done away from those stressors, I found there was a high bar to prove my need. My therapist wrote a letter, but that wasn’t enough. I had to provide proof from a medical doctor, and I had nowhere to turn; at the time, I wasn’t on medication for my depression. My request was denied and a few weeks later, I was let go for different reasons. Having a job that’s a good fit with a supportive team makes all the difference. I recently became a forensic nurse, and the other day my boss asked me about taking some night shifts. Sleep is a big need for me to function well. I can’t work overnight shifts. I also struggle with waking up early. These are physical issues, not lifestyle preferences. Fatigue and difficulty with early wake-up times are typical symptoms of major depressive disorder. I said, “I'm happy to do that, but then I can’t work the very next day because of my depression and chronic fatigue .” That was just fine by my boss."

        "Talking about depression socially has never felt much like a disclosure. It's always just been part of the conversation. My friends and I talk about how we feel, about our good days and bad days, and my depression informs all of that. I think it helps that many of my friends also have mental illness or are disabled in some way. There's already an understanding in place. But I also talk about my depression a lot on social media. One of the main reasons is to help normalize it, especially for people whose lives otherwise fit into a straightforward, standard-issue mold. Mine doesn’t. I identify as nonbinary and queer, so I’m not expected to fit into that specific mold. For those who are, I want them to know that if they're struggling with feelings of depression, I'm a safe person to talk to. I want them to know depression is not a bad thing. It’s also my job to talk about a lot of “taboo” topics -- and to help other people talk about them comfortably. [In addition to being a registered nurse ,] I’m a health educator and owner of Intimate Health Consulting. We train health care professionals and organizations to understand and navigate issues around sexual health that require special care, like LGBT issues, sexual function problems, and sexual assault survivorship. A lot of times I’m talking about things that are uncomfortable for some people, but we need to talk about them."
