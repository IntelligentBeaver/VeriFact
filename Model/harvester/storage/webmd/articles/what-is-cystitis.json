The reason is the loss of of the female hormone estrogen when you stop having your period. Estrogen helps your urethra muscles stay strong and raises the level of healthy bacteria in your vagina and urethra. Low estrogen after menopause means that there's less healthy bacteria in your urethra and vagina to fight off the unhealthy bacteria like E. coli . Low estrogen also thins out the walls of your vagina and urethra and makes them drier, which increases the risk of unhealthy bacteria getting in.",
