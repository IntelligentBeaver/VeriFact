        "Atrial fibrillation, also called AF or AFib, is a quivery, fluttery heartbeat. You might also hear the doctor call it arrhythmia. It means your heart’s normal rhythm is out of whack. Because your blood isn't moving well, you're more likely to have heart failure. That's when your heart can't keep up with your body’s needs. Blood can also pool inside your heart and form clots. If a clot gets stuck in your brain, you can have a stroke.",
        "What happens in AFib? Normally, the top part of your heart (the atria) squeezes first, then the bottom part (the ventricles). The problem starts in the upper part of your heart. The timing of these contractions is what moves the blood. When you have AFib, the electrical signals that control this process go haywire. This causes the atria to act independently, instead of working together.",
        "AFib vs. atrial flutter",
        "Both are problems with your heart's beating. When you have atrial flutter , your heart beats too fast but still mostly in a regular rhythm. When you have AFib, your heart's rhythm is irregular."
