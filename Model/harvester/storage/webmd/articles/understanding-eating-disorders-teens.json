Upset with a sudden weight gain , the 15-year-old forced herself to throw up after eating her school lunch. It seemed harmless. After all, most of the kids at her lunch table had done it before, and they seemed OK.",
        "Then, after doing it five times, Kerri had a new ritual of vomiting right after eating. She did it at school and then again at home. No one knew -- until Thanksgiving. She had eaten more than usual and told her parents she felt sick. Suddenly, there was a tap on the bathroom door. Kerri's parents were standing outside the door, asking how long she'd been throwing up her food.",
        "\"Mason,\" 14, was also obsessed about his weight . Short and chunky most of his life, Mason had a growth spurt. Now tall and thin, he was determined to never to be \"the fat kid\" again. Mason hated throwing up. So, he started eating salads with no dressing, running miles each day, and taking laxatives to keep his weight down."
