        "In 2006, the FDA approved the first treatment for Pompe disease. It consists of regular IV infusions of a man-made enzyme called alglucosidase alfa. The drug does the job of an enzyme in your body that doesn't work correctly when you have Pompe disease. This process, known as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), is still the only treatment approved for the condition.",

        "The disease also damages skeletal muscles and the muscles you need to breathe."
