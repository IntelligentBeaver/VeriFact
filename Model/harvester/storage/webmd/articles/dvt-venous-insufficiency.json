        "The veins in your legs carry blood back up to your heart. They have one-way valves that keep blood from flowing back downward. When you have chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), these valves can't close completely. As a result, some of the blood goes back down into your legs and pools in the veins there. CVI can also keep your leg muscles from pumping enough blood back toward your heart. It sometimes results in vein blockages, too.",
        "CVI can affect all the types of veins in your legs. This includes:",
        "Over time, CVI can cause pain, swelling, varicose veins, and skin changes in your legs. It may also lead to open sores called ulcers on your legs.",
        "It's a fairly common condition in older people. In the U.S., more than 11 million men and 22 million women ages 40- 80 have varicose veins, while over 2 million people have advanced CVI. More than 20,000 people are diagnosed with ulcers due to CVI each year.",
