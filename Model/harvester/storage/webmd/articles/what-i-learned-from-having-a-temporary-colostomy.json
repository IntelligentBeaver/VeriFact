        "In January of 2024, I experienced a medical emergency that many people with Crohn’s disease dread thinking about.",
        "After being taken to the hospital by ambulance and extensive diagnostic testing, it was confirmed that I had had a bowel perforation , otherwise known as a hole, in my large intestine.",
        "Since Crohn’s is an autoimmune disease that can weaken areas of the intestine, and this kind of thing is always a possibility when dealing with the disease, many tend to worry about this happening. However, at only 38 years old, I always thought I was still too young for something like this to happen. Obviously, I was very wrong.",
        "Within 30 minutes of my diagnosis, I was prepped and ready for surgery. Since this was an emergency and not a planned treatment, my experience resulted in an open abdominal surgery that removed at least 5 inches of my large intestine. After cleaning up waste to reduce toxicity and infection, my surgeon then awarded me a temporary colostomy . This was a way to connect my colon to the surface of my belly to provide an alternate route for waste to leave the body while my large intestine healed."

I developed mood swings over my situation because it was hard to process and accept my medical situation as it was.
