        "Coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke are two of the deadliest health problems in the United States. CAD takes a toll on the heart, while stroke damages the brain. When you have either one of these conditions, you are more likely to get the other.",
        "CAD is the most common type of heart disease . It can happen when a waxy substance called plaque builds up in the coronary arteries. These are the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to your heart. The buildup can narrow these arteries over time and limit or cut off blood flow. That can lead to a heart attack , heart failure , or other serious problems.",
        "A stroke can happen when a blood clot , a buildup of plaque, or other particles block arteries leading to your brain . It can also happen if a blood vessel in your brain bursts. Either way, brain cells get damaged, and the symptoms show up in the parts of your body that those brain cells control. For example, after a stroke, you might have weakness or paralysis in one part of your face. A stroke can lead to long-term brain damage , disability, or death.",
        "CAD and stroke have different symptoms, so it’s a good idea to be aware of the warning signs for both. That way you can get potentially lifesaving medical care as soon as possible and lower your chances of severe or long-lasting health problems."
