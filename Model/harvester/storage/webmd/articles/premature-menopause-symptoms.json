They may also order a test to measure your estradiol levels. Low levels of estradiol, a form of estrogen , can indicate that your ovaries are starting to fail. When estradiol levels are below 30, it may signal that you are in menopause.",

When your ovaries slow down their production of estrogen, your levels of FSH increase. When your FSH levels rise above 40 mIU/mL, it usually indicates that you are in menopause."
