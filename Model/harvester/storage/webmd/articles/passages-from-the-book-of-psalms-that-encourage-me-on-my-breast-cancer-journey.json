        "Reading different parts of the Bible is an important part of my spiritual walk. Throughout my breast cancer journey, I have had to rely heavily on it to bring me peace and hope. One of my favorite books is Psalms, which is found in the Old Testament and is composed of songs or poems that are sometimes sung or used for prayer.",
        "During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, I was also dealing with the possibility that the cancer had spread to my bones . Some of my friends and I decided to have weekly prayer calls to specifically target my health and to support each other during such a difficult time in society. We have met every Wednesday since then, and I have experienced some major breakthroughs as a result (6 months after we started praying together, my scans no longer showed any signs of cancer in my bones).",
        "Earlier this year, we decided to read the entire 150 chapters of Psalms. It was truly a blessing. This is when I realized that some of my favorite songs that I have sung during praise and worship in church were pulled directly from Psalms.",
        "Below are five of my favorite verses that resonate with me as I face different challenges that I need encouragement for."

        "When it is time for me to have scans to check how effective the treatment that I am on is or to ensure that nothing has spread to another part of my body: Psalm 23:4 - “Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me.”",
        "When things get a little scary if my health starts to fail or I become weary during my breast cancer journey: Psalm 27:13-14 - “I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord.”",
        "Even when I have had a tough day for any reason. I don’t have to remain downtrodden because sunshine follows the rain: Psalm 30:5 - “Weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.”",
        "God has been with me through so many trials and tribulations that I have endured since I was a child. I keep the faith that he will never leave my side: Psalm 71:5-6, 14 - “For you have been my hope, Sovereign Lord, my confidence since my youth. From birth I have relied on you; you brought me forth from my mother's womb. I will ever praise you. … As for me, I will always have hope; I will praise you more and more.”",
        "When I am concerned about the uncertainty of my future: Psalm 94:19 - “Father, In the midst of my anxiety, I find solace in your loving consolation, and Your joy becomes my strength. I release my worries and burdens to you, trusting in Your faithful presence to bring me serenity and peace.”"
