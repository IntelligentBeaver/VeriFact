I’ll go first. “Do you know you can get dandruff on your face?” This is my response when patients come to my office with complaints of redness, flaking, and itching on their faces. Dandruff, medically referred to as seborrheic dermatitis, is a very common skin condition. The main culprit is malassezia, a family of fungi that exclusively affects the skin and is implicated in several common skin conditions.",
        "Studies have identified the presence of malassezia yeast on infant skin, suggesting the yeast can live in harmony with the various skin flora that naturally occur on human skin. For reasons not yet known, it is unclear when the yeast takes a turn from a harmless skin resident to a pathogen.",
        "In infants, malassezia causes “cradle cap,” which looks like white, thick, greasy scales on the scalp. When seborrheic dermatitis is flaring, it presents as flaking, redness, and sometimes itching on the T-zone of your face."
