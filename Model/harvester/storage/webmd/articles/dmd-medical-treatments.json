        "People with DMD will likely take steroids starting at a young age. Steroids help make it so the condition worsens more slowly. It's usually best to start them before the physical symptoms of DMD get serious. Some steroids are specially approved to treat DMD. Studies have shown that steroids can improve strength. They also may help muscles work better. As a result, you can do things like climb stairs faster. Lung function may improve, too. Steroids such as prednisone make it less likely that your child's spine will curve (scoliosis ). They may make you more able to walk for longer. Some studies suggest people with DMD also live longer when they take steroids. But not all studies back this up. The oral corticosteroid deflazacort (Emflaza) is specifically approved to treat DMD. A unique new type of steroid, vamorolone (Agamree), is also available for kids and teens with DMD. It helps reduce inflammation without many of the side effects of other steroids such as weight gain, bone loss, and lack of growth. You take it as a daily pill. Ask your child's doctor which steroid they recommend and why."

        "People with DMD have a change (a mutation) in the gene for a protein called dystrophin, which helps protect muscles as you move. The mutations stop your body from making the protein, which leads to muscle damage. This is where exon-skipping drugs come in. Exons are sections of a gene, and some on your dystrophin gene are missing when you have DMD. Exon-skipping drugs are made of tiny snippets of genetic material that help your body \"skip\" over missing exons when it makes dystrophin. This allows your cells to make a protein that's shorter than it should be, but that still works at least somewhat. Exon-skipping drugs could potentially help lots of people with DMD. But people with DMD need drugs that skip different parts of the gene, depending on where their mutation is. The FDA has approved drugs that skip exons 45, 51, and 53: Casimersen (Amondys 45) Eteplirsen (Exondys 51) Golodirsen (Vyondys 53) Viltolarsen (Viltepso)"
