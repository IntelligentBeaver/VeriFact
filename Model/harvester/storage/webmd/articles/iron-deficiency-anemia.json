        "What are the 4 main causes of iron deficiency anemia? The main causes of iron deficiency anemia are losing blood, having a diet low in iron, being pregnant, and being unable to absorb iron.",
        "What are the stages of iron deficiency anemia? There are 3 stages of iron deficiency anemia. In the first stage, the iron that your body is taking in is less than what your body needs, but your red blood cells are not yet affected. In the second stage, you develop iron-deficient erythropoiesis during which your bone marrow makes red blood cells, but without enough hemoglobin. In the third stage, your hemoglobin levels will be below the normal range because you don't have enough iron to make hemoglobin. Your symptoms would begin at this stage.",
        "Can you fix iron deficiency anemia? You can increase your iron levels by eating iron-rich foods or taking an iron supplement or getting an iron infusion. Talk to your doctor about the best option for you.",
        "What is the difference between iron deficiency and anemia? Iron deficiency is having low iron storage in your body that don't meet the level that your body needs. Iron-deficiency can cause anemia, which occurs when your body doesn't have enough iron to make healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. You can have iron deficiency without being anemic, where your hemoglobin level is normal but your iron is low."
