        "Separation anxiety disorder (SAD) is a condition in which a child becomes fearful and nervous when away from home or separated from a loved one -- usually a parent or other caregiver -- to whom the child is attached. Some children also develop physical symptoms, such as headaches or stomachaches, at the thought of being separated. The fear of separation causes great distress to the child and may interfere with their normal activities, like going to school, playing with other children, eating, or sleeping.",
        "Separation anxiety is normal in very young children (those between 8 and 14 months old). Kids often go through a phase when they’re \"clingy\" and afraid of unfamiliar people and places. When this fear affects a child over age 6 years, is heavy, or lasts longer than 4 weeks, the child may have separation anxiety disorder.",
        "Separation anxiety affects approximately 4%-5% of children in the U.S. ages 7 to 11 years. It is less common in teenagers, affecting about 1.3% of American teens . It affects boys and girls equally."
