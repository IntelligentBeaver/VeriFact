It’s calculated by a radiologist (a doctor who is an expert in medical imaging) specializing in cancer. The ratio is based on the risk of your cancer spreading (alpha) or returning (beta). A specialist may recommend fewer but higher doses of radiation or more frequent but smaller doses, depending on what type of endometrial cancer you have.",
