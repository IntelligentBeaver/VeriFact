Forty percent of teachers use computers for instruction, and at least one computer is in 97% of all American classrooms. That adds up to a lot of screen time for kids who also watch TV or play on the computer at home. But is it harmful to a child’s vision ?",

        "What does science say? So far, no evidence-based study has found that new technology itself causes vision problems, other than eye fatigue . Yet a 2009 study showed that the number of people with nearsightedness ( myopia ) has increased from 25% to nearly 42% in the last 30 years.",

        "3D is an exciting and fun new technology being used in many classrooms all across the country. Sheedy, along with other vision health experts, was involved in the recent AOA report, \"3D in the Classroom: See Well, Learn Well.\" It conclusively states that watching 3D images does not harm children's eyesight. In fact, says Sheedy, \"viewing 3D is actually a pretty good screening mechanism for people who've got vision problems.\"",
        "In order to see something in 3D, each eye needs to process a separate image, Sheedy explains. The 3D glasses help us do that. Your eyes need to converge, or come together, to see the 3D objects that appear closer to you, yet your focus remains on the main display screen. This challenges our eye coordination and eye focusing skills. Thus, it can reveal weaknesses in our vision that aren't detected in simple vision tests ."

This may be a sign of eye health problems such as lazy eye , poor focusing and coordination skills, or vision misalignment. Hoenig and Sheedy both recommend that parents ask children how they feel after viewing 3D. If the child complains of any of these symptoms, schedule an appointment for a full eye exam that includes testing eye coordination and focusing skills. The good news is that most of these children's vision problems can be treated with glasses or contact lenses .",
