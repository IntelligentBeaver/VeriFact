        "ERCP, which is short for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, is a procedure used to diagnose and treat problems related to pancreatic ducts and bile ducts.",
        "The word “endoscopic” means it’s done with an endoscope -- a long, thin tube with a light and camera that allows doctors to see inside your body. The endoscope is inserted through your mouth and slowly lowered through your stomach to the duodenum. This is the part of your small intestine just after your stomach.",
        "Once the tip of the endoscope is in place, the doctor injects dye through the tube and takes X-rays to see where the dye travels. The goal is to see how the dye flows through the pancreatic and bile ducts. This will show if there are any blockages and where they are. Your doctor may also be able to do some procedures, such as removing gallstones from the bile duct, while doing the ERCP.",
        "What are bile and pancreatic ducts?",
        "Your bile and pancreatic ducts are what help the fluids in your digestive system go where they should. Your liver makes bile, a fluid that breaks down fats. Your bile ducts carry the bile to your gallbladder and your duodenum. Your pancreas makes pancreatic juice, which contains enzymes your body needs to break down the food you eat. The pancreatic ducts allow the pancreatic juice to flow into the duodenum."
