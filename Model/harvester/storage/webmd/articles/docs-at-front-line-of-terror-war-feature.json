        "Like a special forces team without a target, the biggest problem for doctors on the front lines of healthcare today is not knowing where the enemy lurks or how it may strike. For a healthcare system responsible for handling the aftermath of terrorism in its many forms, preparing for the unexpected in the post-9/11 world is an unprecedented challenge.",
        "After the attack on 9/11, emergency room personnel in New York City anxiously awaited injured survivors from the World Trade Center. Weeks later, physicians and healthcare providers across the country faced a deluge of worried patients who feared they might have been exposed to anthrax spores. And earlier this year, a thwarted \"dirty bomb\" plot had doctors rushing for a refresher course in treating radiation exposure.",
        "As these events have shown, unmasking a terrorist attack can be as simple as reporting a suspicious rash to the local health department. But at the same time, hospitals have to be prepared for something as complex as mass hysteria and a rapid influx of casualties.",
        "That means doctors and healthcare providers have now joined the ranks and are an integral part of the country's defense in the war against terrorism. And they're finding that the learning curve is both steep and broad."
