        "Feb. 24, 2023 – In a clinical trial, a procedure using ultrasound and requiring no incisions successfully reduced a side effect of Parkinson’s treatments known as dyskinesia, which is an involuntary movement of the body. The ultrasound also improved motor impairment in people with Parkinson’s disease.",
        "The procedure used in the trial is called focused ultrasound ablation, which is different than using ultrasound for imaging purposes. Instead, focused ultrasound ablation is like using a magnifying glass to focus sunlight on a target. The ultrasound wavelengths can target body tissue, heat it, and destroy it. For the Parkinson’s procedure, the target was in the brain.",
        "“Focused ultrasound is an exciting new treatment for patients with certain neurological disorders,” said researcher Vibhor Krishna, MD, associate professor of neurosurgery at UNC School of Medicine, in a statement . “The procedure is incisionless, eliminating the risks associated with surgery. Using focused ultrasound, we can target a specific area of the brain and safely ablate the diseased tissue.”"
