        "It's best to see an eye doctor (an ophthalmologist or an optometrist ) who's trained to diagnose and treat people with diabetes. First, you'll probably have visual acuity testing to check for vision loss. The doctor uses a series of eye charts to find out how well you see at different distances. Before a dilated (slit-lamp) eye exam , your doctor will use eyedrops to make your pupils bigger (dilated). This lets in more light so it's easier for them to see inside your eye. Then your doctor looks at the retina – the place at the back of your eye where light hits – for problems like leaking blood vessels and swelling. They can also spot bleeding in your macula. That's the part of your retina that gets damaged by DME. Retinal imaging takes pictures of the back of your eye and sends them to a computer, where an eye doctor checks them for signs of disease. This doesn't take the place of a full eye exam. But it can be a good way to start if you don't live near a doctor trained to diagnose DME."

It's like an ultrasound , but it uses light waves instead to create very fine, detailed images of tissues inside your eye.
