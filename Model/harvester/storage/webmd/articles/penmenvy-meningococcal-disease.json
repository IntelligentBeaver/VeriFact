        "Any infection caused by the Neisseria meningitidis ( N. meningitidis ) bacteria is called meningococcal disease. Meningococcal disease is very serious. It can lead to limb amputations, hearing loss, nervous system problems, brain damage, seizures, strokes, or even death. The two most common types of meningococcal diseases are meningococcal meningitis and meningococcal septicemia (a blood infection).",
        "Meningococcal disease is spread by contact with infected respiratory and throat secretions through things like coughing; kissing; sneezing; or shared drinks, eating utensils, smoking devices, or lip makeup. The risk of infection increases with close or prolonged contact with someone who is infected. Family members in the same house, caregivers, or sharing a crowded living situation, such as living in a college dorm, may also increase risk.",

For a long time, there were two types of meningococcal vaccines available to protect against meningococcal disease. Meningococcal ACWY vaccines act against certain groups of N. meningitidis bacteria known as A, C, W, and Y. Meningococcal B vaccines act against the B group of N. meningitidis . The newest meningococcal vaccine , Penmenvy , and one other vaccine, Penbraya , basically combine these two types into one vaccine, covering five groups of N. meningitidis ."

So if you got Penmenvy, and you need a meningococcal B booster, Bexsero is what is recommended for your booster. If you need a meningococcal A, C, W, Y booster, any available vaccine can be used as they are interchangeable.",
