        "Psoriasis is a chronic disease where your immune system becomes overactive and makes skin cells too quickly. As these cells build up, they form psoriasis plaques, thick raised patches of skin with silvery scales. There’s no cure for psoriasis. But you can remove these psoriasis plaques. When you remove dead skin, it helps medications and ointments work better. It can also help you feel better about how you look. But you need to do it safely to avoid pain, infection, and bleeding."

        "You can treat psoriasis patches with chemical exfoliants. Unlike physical exfoliants, where you use a tool like a brush, sponge, or scrub to remove psoriasis plaques, chemical exfoliation uses chemicals to dissolve them. People with psoriasis plaques often have sensitive skin, so mechanical exfoliation may be too irritating for them. Instead, they may be better off with a chemical exfoliant. Applied to the skin, products with these acids work by weakening the bonds between skin cells. This causes the outer layer to shed, which softens and removes scales. You can buy creams, lotions, gels, ointments, foams, and shampoos with these acids. They’re available over the counter (OTC) or in stronger doses by prescription. Side effects include irritation, stinging, and burning."
