Officially known as gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, acid reflux occurs when food and stomach acids escape up into the esophagus through the valve at the top of the stomach. That causes the burning sensation that can sometimes rise up into the throat, known as heartburn.",

A few practical tips can help you put out the fire of heartburn before it starts."

For some people, drinking carbonated beverages along with a meal can exacerbate the problem.",

Elevating the head of your bed a few inches enlists gravity to help keep stomach contents from rising, Sheth says. You can also use a wedge-shaped pillow to elevate your upper body at night.

Some research links vigorous exercise to an increase in reflux risk."
