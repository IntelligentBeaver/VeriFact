        "Mar. 7, 2024 -- Weight management is something that many people struggle with. And sometimes, it can feel impossible. But what happens when we shift our focus beyond the scale? How would incorporating sleep management tools, social support and connection, and other pillars of lifestyle medicine positively impact our experience with weight management? To guide us through this topic, we spoke to Mahima Gulati, MD , a triple board-certified physician specializing in endocrinology, diabetes, metabolism, and lifestyle medicine, and associate professor of Medical Sciences at the Frank H. Netter School of Medicine, Quinnipiac University, about how GLP-1 agonists work for obesity management and how the six key pillars of lifestyle medicine can assist with weight loss and weight management from incorporating a plant-based diet to sustainable physical activity and more."
