        "A common symptom of AS is chest pain or stiffness that gets worse when you take a deep breath, sneeze, cough, exercise, or put your chest in certain positions. These are signs of chest inflammation, a condition called costochondritis . This inflammation can limit how far your chest expands and cause pain when you try to breathe deeply. Chest inflammation from AS is common: It happens in 70% of cases."
