        "Repatha (evolocumab) is an injectable medicine that helps lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), often called “bad” cholesterol. Approved in 2015, Repatha can now be used in adults with poorly controlled LDL who haven’t been diagnosed with heart disease but are at high risk for serious heart problems such as stroke, heart attack, and death. Until now, Repatha was approved for lowering LDL in adults with diagnosed heart disease.",
        "The recent approval also allows Repatha to be used as a standalone treatment in adults and children ages 10 and older with a rare genetic form of high cholesterol known as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). It is also approved for use in adults and children ages 10 and older for another genetic cholesterol disorder, called heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH).",
        "Repatha belongs to a group of medicines known as PCSK9 inhibitors. It helps your liver remove more LDL cholesterol from your blood and lower your overall cholesterol levels. Repatha should be used along with diet and exercise.",
        "High LDL levels are one of the main risk factors for heart disease, which is the leading cause of death in the U.S. This expanded approval allows Repatha to be used earlier to help prevent these events in people who are at risk and whose cholesterol levels haven’t responded well to diet, exercise, or statins alone."
