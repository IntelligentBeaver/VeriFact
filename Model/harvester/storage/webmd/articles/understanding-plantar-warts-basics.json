        "Plantar warts are warts that develop on plantar surfaces -- that is, the soles (or bottom) of the feet. Normal standing and walking tends to force them into the skin, and the pressure causes pain to the affected area. Calluses formed by the body’s attempt to prevent spread of warts can also cause pain when walking. Plantar warts are harmless and may go away even without treatment, but in many cases they are too painful to ignore. Plantar warts that grow together in a cluster are known as mosaic warts."
