        "Ryan Piansky, a PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, has had eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) since he was 2 years old. The condition causes swelling in your esophagus from too many white blood cells. Certain food allergies – meat, nuts, apples , rice, and sweet potatoes, in Piansky’s case – trigger EoE. While it’s possible to lead a normal life with EoE, you have to take some extra steps to plan ahead."

        "Many people with EoE are diagnosed at a young age. “From the day I was born, I was really, really sick,” Piansky says. “Throughout my entire infancy I had failure to thrive, I would throw up, I would refuse to eat, I wasn't gaining weight or growing.” As Piansky got older, his food allergies impacted his life in different ways. But the good news is that EoE is a treatable disorder. “People can live a really happy and healthy life,” he says. “I think it's super important to understand that this is not the end of the world. This shouldn’t derail your life. You can live the exact life that you want to lead. EoE just makes you think a little more about things.”"

Because of these symptoms, Piansky has had to make certain adjustments throughout his life: After his diagnosis, Piansky’s mother began to work with him to find meals that he could safely eat. This later helped develop Piansky’s love for baking and cooking. “That hobby started when I was young. As I've gotten older, and tried more foods and worked with my doctors to get on the right mix of medicines. I'm able to eat more,” he says. At first, experimenting with ingredients was a way for Piansky and his mother to learn how to make nice-tasting recipes that worked with his allergies. “Living on my own, I still really enjoy baking and cooking. Now that I have more foods available to me, I've really gotten to enjoy trying a bunch of new things.”"

Or they’d ask if they should pick up anything to have in their house so I can snack on,” he says. “Communication with your friends is really, really important. That way, we can make sure we’re all on the same page. You’ll have the information you need to make sure that you can have a successful time out.”",
