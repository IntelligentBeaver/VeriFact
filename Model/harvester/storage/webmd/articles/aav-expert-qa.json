You give patients a lot of medication up front in order to calm down the immune system and induce remission, in which the disease becomes inactive and doesn’t cause symptoms. Induction typically involves high doses of glucocorticoids, which are steroids like prednisone, as well as rituximab (Riabni, Rituxan, Ruxience, Truxima), a biologic drug that suppresses the immune system. Once in remission, we move to the maintenance stage, in which we use lower doses of rituximab or other drugs to keep patients in remission.",

A new drug, avacopan (Tavneos), approved in 2021, has really been a breakthrough, as it helps us reduce the amount of steroids we use. A side effect of drugs like rituximab is an increased risk of infection, so we often use medications like antibiotics to prevent specific infections such as a lung infection called pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP)."

In addition to taking medications, you can help protect your heart health if you reduce stress, quit smoking, and make sure you sleep well and exercise regularly. Also, follow a healthy eating plan, such as the Mediterranean diet, that excludes processed foods and limits animal products in favor of plant-based protein."

        "There are two goals. The first is to control the disease. We do this in two stages. First is what we call induction therapy. You give patients a lot of medication up front in order to calm down the immune system and induce remission, in which the disease becomes inactive and doesn’t cause symptoms. Induction typically involves high doses of glucocorticoids, which are steroids like prednisone, as well as rituximab (Riabni, Rituxan, Ruxience, Truxima), a biologic drug that suppresses the immune system. Once in remission, we move to the maintenance stage, in which we use lower doses of rituximab or other drugs to keep patients in remission.",
        "The second goal of treatment is to mitigate — as much as possible — the side effects of these medications. Prednisone is a very good medication for suppressing inflammation, but it’s very toxic if you keep taking it. For example, it affects bone health and can lead to fractures. A new drug, avacopan (Tavneos), approved in 2021, has really been a breakthrough, as it helps us reduce the amount of steroids we use. A side effect of drugs like rituximab is an increased risk of infection, so we often use medications like antibiotics to prevent specific infections such as a lung infection called pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP)."
