I was fortunate enough to participate in a special migraine video series and I finally gave my mom her flowers as someone who helped me in my early migraine days.

Mindfulness takes many forms. I started not only paying attention to my own health and self-care, but I tuned my ears to others when they mentioned they had a migraine. If I wasn’t having one myself, I tried to extend compassion and grace. It takes a village to raise a child. It takes an army to fight a migraine.",

A few years ago, I started sending up what some might call small prayers. Although migraine has been a big part of my life, I haven’t always seen it as worthy of prayer. I was resolved to just live with the episodes, and that’s it. I’ve noticed as I’ve started praying about pain relief, connection to resources, or awareness about how to improve my overall health that God has listened.  I guess that’s how prayer works."
