        "Cordyceps is a fungus that has a long history in traditional Chinese medicine and other Eastern medical practices. There are several species of cordyceps (more than 750), and they’re found around the world.",
        "Cordyceps infects different types of insects, depending on the species of fungus. Some target a certain type of carpenter ant, but not other types of ants, for example. Others target spiders, moths, and dragonflies.",
        "A type of cordyceps known as Ophiocordyceps unilateralis (also called zombie-ant fungus) spreads when a spore latches onto an ant. This spore then gets inside the ant’s body and spreads throughout. This is where the “zombie” comes in. Once the fungus has taken over the ant’s body, the ant starts acting oddly. Instead of normally following the paths it usually follows, it starts to walk aimlessly. After a few days, the ant dies and a stalk grows out of its head. This stalk releases more fungus spores, and they spread to other ants.",
        "Cordyceps doesn’t infect humans. If you are exposed to it, the fungus can’t stay alive in your body.",
        "Cordyceps is a fungus that infects different types of insects. In traditional Chinese and Eastern medicine, cordyceps can be a daily treatment for good health. The fungus has been studied for its effects on many conditions, but there isn’t much conclusive research about whether cordyceps has real health benefits such as delaying aging and reducing inflammation.
