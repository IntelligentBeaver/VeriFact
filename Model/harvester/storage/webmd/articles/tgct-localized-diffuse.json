        "Tenosynovial giant cell tumors (TGCTs) are growths in the soft tissue in and around your joints. While they are tumors, they are benign. That means that they rarely  spread to other parts of your body and they aren’t life-threatening. It depends on where you have a TGCT, but they can make it hard for you to move your joint or the part of the body where it’s growing. They can damage your joint and the tissue around them. They also can be painful and affect your quality of life. TGCTs also can grow fast. If you have surgery to remove a TGCT, it may still come back, or recur. The reason they’re called tenosynovial giant cell tumors is partly because of the way they look under a microscope. If you could zoom in and see it, they look like clusters of unusually giant cells. The word “tenosynovial” comes from the places where these happen. TGCTs affect the synovium, the thin layer of tissue covering the surfaces of your joint spaces. They also can affect tendon sheaths, or the layer of membrane covering your tendons, which is the fibrous tissue connecting your muscles to your bones. You also can get TGCTs in your bursa, which are protective, fluid-filled sacs where your muscles, tendons, and bones meet."

        "If your TGCT is localized, then it’s limited to a particular place. You can have a localized TGCT anywhere in your body where you have joints. They usually start as a small growth or nodule that’s connected to the affected part of your joint with a stalk. They also will look well-defined or encapsulated. Most localized TGCTs will be in or around  the joints of your fingers, hands, and wrists. It’s less common to get them in joints of your foot, ankle, knee, hip, or other joints. Doctors used to call a localized TGCT a giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath (GCTTS), tenosynovitis, or nodular synovitis. Diffuse TGCTs tend to grow more aggressively and cause more problems. They’re called diffuse because they are spread out over a bigger area of your joint instead of being concentrated in a smaller, well-defined spot."

        "It’s not clear what causes TGCTs. But up to 16% of the cells in the tumor will have a specific chromosomal abnormality. Your cells normally have 46 chromosomes, which contain your DNA. The type of abnormality in TGCT is a chromosomal translocation. That means that a piece of one of your chromosomes has broken off and gotten attached to another chromosome. The specific translocation in TGCT involves parts of chromosomes 1 and 2. The cells with this chromosomal abnormality make too much of a protein called colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). Because of that, they attract certain other cells including white blood cells called macrophages. Most of the cells in your TGCT will be these macrophages and other cells that are attracted to the CSF-1 made by those abnormal cells. The macrophages and other cells in your TGCT likely cause the inflammation and other symptoms of TGCT. While doctors now know the underlying causes for TGCTs, it isn’t clear why this happens. The chromosomal abnormality that leads to increases in CSF-1 might just happen randomly and for no reason."
