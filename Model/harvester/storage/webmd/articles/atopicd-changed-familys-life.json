        "By Christina Martin, as told to Batya Swift Yasgur, MA, LSW Christina Martin lives in Southern California. She is the mother of three children, ages 3, 5, and 7, and works in student services. Her 5-year-old son has atopic dermatitis . Our journey started minutes after our little boy was born. I was happily holding our new baby when the pediatrician pointed out that he had some type of rash on his cheeks. My husband and I weren’t worried at first. We were second-time parents and remembered our first baby having cradle cap and baby acne. “No problem,” we thought. “This will pass.” But we were wrong. It got much worse. When our son was 6 weeks old – literally overnight –the “cradle cap” spread all the way down from his face to his chest and he was covered with an intense, oozing, scaly rash. It was scary to see. It looked like the cradle cap had crawled down his body. We took him to an urgent care center right away, but the doctor didn’t offer any diagnosis. He prescribed a topical steroid cream and encouraged me to follow up with the primary care doctor. The cream helped to reduce the rash, although it didn’t clear it up completely. The pediatrician said, “It might be atopic dermatitis, also called eczema , but I’m not sure. You need to see a dermatologist .” We got a referral and made an appointment for a few weeks down the road."

Now, he was covered from head to toe with deep, oozing, yellow scales, and he was in terrible discomfort. Of course, he couldn’t sleep, which also meant that we couldn’t get any sleep. We got a same-day appointment with the pediatrician, who prescribed stronger topical steroids as well as an antibiotic and an antihistamine to help with the itching. Since there were so many open sores, we were all worried about possible infection, so the pediatrician expedited the dermatology referral and referred us to an allergist."

        "The dermatologist said to us, “I don’t want your son to miss out on normal childhood experiences because of atopic dermatitis. We’ll keep trying until we find what works for him.” He was great at prescribing different classes of steroids and other types of medications, and at sitting us down and laying out a plan after explaining all the possible protocols. We finally felt we were included, like we were all part of the same team to help our son. We finally felt that our son’s needs – as well as our needs as parents – were being recognized. We’ve been using the same dermatologist since then. My son was switched from topical steroids back to oral steroids, and he also received other stronger topical medications as well as antihistamines. Eventually, during the first 6 months of working with the new treatment plan, our little boy slept through the night for the very first time in his life! It felt miraculous to see the changes. We saw a reduction in itching. We watched his hands soften over the next 6 months, which was amazing. It was amazing to watch him sleep without waking up to scratch. And the healing his body was doing as he began to get enough sleep was wonderful."

Also, recognize that your child’s illness can put a huge strain on your marriage and relationships, so see if it’s possible for you to get help, both individually and as a couple. And try, if possible, to give space and focus to your other child or children, if you have any. I know how challenging that can be, so don’t beat yourself up if it’s not possible. This brings me to another point. It’s natural for parents to feel guilty and helpless when they see their beloved child suffering. But as much as you can, try not to blame yourself. It’s not your fault that your child has this illness. Your guilt will be destructive to your own mental health and well-being, and it certainly won’t help your child. Lastly, advocate for your child. Don’t take “no” for an answer. If you’re not satisfied with your doctor’s approach, don’t be shy about finding another doctor. You should feel like a valued team member in your child’s care, and you should feel that your concerns are heard and being addressed."
