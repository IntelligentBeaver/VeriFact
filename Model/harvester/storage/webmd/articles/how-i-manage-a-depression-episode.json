        "Even though I have lived with depression for nearly 10 years, the long depressive episodes (or depression days if they are short-lasting) are something I don’t think I will ever get used to. On days when the joy and light in my life are completely obscured by depression, I feel like the world is caving in and I have been left trapped alone in my head.",
        "I can feel when the depression begins to sneak in. If it traps me in the morning, I wake up exhausted even after 9 hours of sleep. I feel heavy and empty at the exact same time. I pull myself out of bed with all the strength that I have and instantly feel gloom overcome my judgment, purpose, and outlook on the world. I cry as I get ready, wishing I could stay in bed all day, in my safe cocoon of sadness.",
        "If depression traps me in the afternoon, it is usually sparked by an event -- maybe making a mistake at work, thinking about my dead dog, or feeling alone for a second that soon turns into a storm of loneliness in my head. I hide in the bathroom at work. When I get home, I lay on the couch and stare at the ceiling. I stare and stare."
