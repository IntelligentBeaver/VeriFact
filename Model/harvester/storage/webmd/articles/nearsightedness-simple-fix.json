        "Have you been told that your child needs glasses or contacts? Health experts estimate that almost half the U.S. population -- 42% -- has myopia ( nearsighted ness ), a figure that has almost doubled over the past 3 decades and continues to grow. But being nearsighted is more than just an inconvenience: It can pose long-term hazards.",
        "While glasses, contact lenses , eyedrops, and surgery can help kids see clearly , they don't slow myopia from getting worse. Myopia occurs due to a slightly elongated eyeball or a steep curve in the cornea (the clear part in front of the eye). As a result, the light coming into the eye focuses in front of the retina instead of on it. This causes blurred vision.",
        "\"When the eye becomes longer, the tissue of the retina and the structures supporting the optic nerve stretch and become thinner,\" says Andrei Tkatchenko, MD, PhD, associate professor of ophthalmic sciences at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York. \"This thinning increases the risk of retinal detachment , cataracts , glaucoma , and even blindness. The faster myopia progresses and the more the prescription increases, the greater the risk of these diseases.\""
