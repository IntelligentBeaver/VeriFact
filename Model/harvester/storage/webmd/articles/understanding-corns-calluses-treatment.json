Properly positioned moleskin pads can help relieve pressure on a corn. Most foot doctors discourage the use of over-the-counter salicylic-acid corn remedies. When applied improperly, these corn \"plasters\" can create a chemical skin burn in healthy tissue around the corn and cause infections and ulcers (which is a hole through the skin) in patients with diabetes, poor circulation, or numbness in their feet."

Keep the feet dry and friction-free. Wear properly fitting shoes and cotton socks, not wool or synthetic fibers that might irritate the skin.",
