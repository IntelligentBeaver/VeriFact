        "Auto-brewery syndrome is a rare condition that occurs when food ferments in your stomach and produces ethanol, the same alcohol found in alcoholic drinks. The condition can cause you to act like you’re drunk though you haven’t had any alcohol to drink.",
        "If you have auto-brewery syndrome, also known as gut fermentation syndrome, your body has an unbalanced gut microbiome – the bacteria, fungi, and viruses in your intestines. When you eat too many carbohydrates, your gut makes too much alcohol and your liver can’t digest or metabolize it all and change it to useful energy for your body. As a result, alcohol builds up in your blood. This can produce the same effects as drinking too much alcohol.",
        "Auto-brewery syndrome isn’t a very common condition. Less than 100 cases were reported worldwide in a 2021 report.",
        "The syndrome has been described in medical research for more than 50 years, but researchers are still learning more about it. Many say the condition is widely underdiagnosed, meaning that more people have it, yet do not know. It can be very serious, especially if you have symptoms and get behind the wheel of a vehicle. If you are intoxicated and drive, it could hurt others, or you may be falsely accused of drunk driving. Additionally, you may start to crave alcohol more.",

        "If you have an underlying health condition such as diabetes, you may be more likely to experience auto-brewery syndrome. Ultimately, the syndrome occurs because the food you eat ferments in your stomach, combining with certain gut microbes to make too much alcohol for your liver to handle (even when you haven’t had any alcohol to drink). When your body makes too much alcohol, your blood alcohol levels rise, which can lead to symptoms of traditional intoxication.",
        "How do you fix auto-brewery syndrome?",
        "There are ways to treat the condition, but there’s no standardized treatment. Your doctor may treat you for alcohol poisoning or give you an antifungal medication or an antibiotic depending on which microbe they think is causing the symptoms.",
