        "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disease that causes progressive muscle weakness. DMD commonly affects boys, where symptoms are seen in early childhood. There is no cure for DMD. Health care providers manage symptoms with steroids, physical therapy, and assistive devices (like braces, wheelchairs). New medicines are being studied to help slow the progression of DMD by targeting the abnormal gene. Elevidys is a new gene therapy medicine for DMD that helps keep muscles strong."

        "Muscles in the body need a protein called dystrophin to work correctly and stay strong. DMD is caused by a genetic mutation that causes the body to make this protein wrong. A mutation is a mistake in the instructions the body uses to make things. Without enough dystrophin, muscles weaken over time. The weakness starts in the legs and pelvis. This makes it hard to run, climb stairs, or get up off the floor. As time goes on, DMD can affect your arms, heart, and lungs."
