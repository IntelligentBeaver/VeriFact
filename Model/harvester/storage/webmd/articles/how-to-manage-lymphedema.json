        "Lymphedema is a medical condition where large amounts of lymphatic fluid get collected in the body’s soft tissues, usually in the arms and legs. Sometimes it can affect the head and neck. Lymphatic fluid is the extra fluid that drains out from cells and tissues once the body has taken in what it needs. It's a long-term condition most commonly seen in people who get cancer treatments in the form of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy .",
        "There is no cure for lymphedema at this time, but the condition can be managed in different ways to reduce swelling and prevent other complications.",
        "Your doctor may recommend surgery if the nonsurgical treatments aren’t working. Lymphedema is a condition that can last a lifetime, but with the right treatment, you can manage your symptoms for better health."

        "Protecting your skin . Lymphedema can sometimes cause skin infections. Hydrate and protect your skin by using moisturizers and sunscreens . Use plastic gloves with a cotton lining to prevent scratches, cuts, and burns. Trim your nails regularly.",
        "Manual lymph drainage (MLD) . This is a form of gentle massage performed by trained professionals. They work to move the excess fluid to areas in the body where the lymph vessels are working correctly. You can learn how to do MLD by yourself too.",

        "Compression garments. These are items like sleeves, stockings , bras, bandages, and face or neckwear that are used to apply compression, which is a type of pressure on the swollen area. The treatment helps drain lymphatic fluid. These are mostly available only with a prescription, and your treating doctor will check the fit to see if it has the right amount of compression for you.",
        "Sequential pneumatic compression. This treatment uses a pump connected to a sleeve that you wear during the treatment. Air gets pumped into the sleeve, which applies pressure to the limb to get the fluid moving.",
