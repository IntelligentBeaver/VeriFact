        "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment for people with conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease, and essential tremor. It’s a way to “turn off” parts of your brain without destroying them.",
        "During the procedure, a doctor places the tip of an electrode in the thalamus (for tremor and multiple sclerosis) or in the globus pallidus or subthalamic nucleus (for Parkinson's disease). The electrode stays in your brain. A wire connects it to a pacemaker-like device put under the skin of your chest. The device generates electrical shocks.",
        "DBS replaces older surgeries that destroy parts of your brain, either the thalamus (thalamotomy) or the globus pallidus (pallidotomy). You can still get these surgeries, but the risks are high. If the surgeon is off by even a fraction of an inch, the procedure may not work and you could have severe complications like paralysis or vision and speech loss."
