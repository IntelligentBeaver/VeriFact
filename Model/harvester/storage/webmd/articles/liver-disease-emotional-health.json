        "When you found out that you had metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, you might have gotten a lot of information about its physical effects on your liver and on the rest of your body. But liver disease can take a toll on your mental and emotional health, too. If you’ve been feeling down since your diagnosis, know that about 1 in 5 people with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), the most serious form of MAFLD, have depression. But that doesn’t mean you should just live with it. There are effective treatments for stress, anxiety, and depression related to chronic illness. If you don’t do anything to help your emotional health, your liver disease could become harder to get under control. Here’s a look at how liver disease affects mental health and how you can get relief."

In a study of nearly 250,000 adults from 60 countries, researchers found that those who were living with depression and a chronic disease had worse health than those living with two chronic diseases but no depression or those living with depression only. There’s evidence that depression and your immune system function have an effect on each other.
