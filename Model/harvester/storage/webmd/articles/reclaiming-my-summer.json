        "Growing up, Michigan winters were brutal, but summers meant one thing: visiting my Palestinian grandmother in Jordan. I’d spend entire days at the pool or on the beach, soaking in as much sun as possible. Being Palestinian, it was in my DNA to love the desert heat! So, when my neurologist linked heat to MS flare-ups, I clung to the delusion I'd be the exception. Denial quickly turned into a harsh reality – time spent in the heat caused weakness, dizziness, and fatigue. For my first summer after my diagnosis, I avoided the beach altogether, accepting this as another loss in my life.",
        "Fast forward: My treatment kicked in, and I had a flare-free year. Spending time in the sun slowly became more bearable, and I realized I had catastrophized. Maybe the desert wasn't entirely out of reach. Reconnecting with my roots was possible, just different. Now I prepare for summer days in advance. My survival kit includes sunscreen, electrolytes, hydration packs, sun hats, sunglasses, and frequent breaks under shade. A beach trip to Cartagena, Colombia, even involved pre-emptive hydration IV infusions. And most importantly, I listen to my body. If I need a break or to retreat from the heat, I do not hesitate to. Developing this relationship with my body has ensured my new normal still contains parts of who I am."

        "So, if you’ve been recently diagnosed with MS and worried that the heat might be an unavoidable risk, take my testament that enjoying your summers is still possible! Like everything else, MS reshaped my normal. Instead of allowing it to take away what makes me who I am, I created a give-and-take relationship. I respect the limits MS asks of me, but I fight for the experiences I deserve. With a little extra preparation, that tropical vacation is still within reach. Embrace the shade, listen to your body, and reclaim your summer!",
