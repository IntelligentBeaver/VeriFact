        "Priapism is a long-lasting erection of the penis that is usually painful. It becomes a medical emergency if it goes on for several hours. It can happen either after or without any sexual arousal or stimulation. While shorter attacks are possible, any erection that lasts more than four hours should be considered priapism. It's caused by problems with blood flow.",
        "All erections depend on blood flowing into and out of the penis through arteries and veins. When you're aroused, the arteries in your pelvis and penis relax and expand, bringing more blood to spongy tissues in the penis. At the same time, the valves in veins close, trapping blood in the area and causing an erection. After the excitement ends, the vein valves open, the blood flows out, and the penis returns to its usual state.",
        "Priapism happens when the blood doesn't drain for some reason or, more rarely, when excess blood keeps flowing into the penis, keeping it erect. While it can happen to anyone with a penis, it's most common in those with certain medical conditions. It can affect children as well as adults."
