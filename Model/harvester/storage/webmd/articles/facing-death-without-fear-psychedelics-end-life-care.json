        "For Christine “Cat” Parlee, who has stage IV metastatic melanoma, the Roots to Thrive program was a godsend. Not that she expects it to save her life: The probability of surviving advanced melanoma for 5 years is about 15%-20%, according to the American Cancer Society, and Parlee was diagnosed in 2017. But an innovative approach to group therapy at Roots to Thrive, based in Nanaimo, British Columbia, has helped her deal with this life-threatening disease.",
        "Parlee’s health issues are complex. As if malignant skin cancer wasn’t enough, the 50-something resident of Vancouver Island also has a condition called trigeminal neuralgia with anesthesia dolorosa. With that rare disorder, she says, “emotional outbursts can literally cause me severe pain. So I got very good at suppressing my emotions.”",
        "“But you don’t grow, or grieve, or eventually accept the end if you don’t process your fears,” she continues. Roots to Life has “allowed me to experience my own anger, fear – the feeling that this is SO unfair – without pain or panic attacks. … It’s one of the hardest yet most beautiful experiences I have ever had to put in words.”"
