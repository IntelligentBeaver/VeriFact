Drinking alcohol isn’t always problem, for instance, but the extreme end is substance abuse. Feeling sad isn’t a problem, but the extreme end is clinical depression. Being annoyed at a neighbor mowing their lawn at 6:30 a.m. isn’t a problem, but confronting them with your own weed whacker? That’s an example of how irritation morphs into behaviors and thoughts that have an effect on your life (or others).
