        "Mental health is an important topic. With more and more individuals being diagnosed with mental health disorders each year, it’s essential to address underlying conditions and support those who are affected. Untreated, mental health conditions can impact our emotional, psychological, and social well-being and affect how we think, act, and feel.",
        "Mental health doesn’t discriminate, and disorders can affect anyone at any age. Some conditions, though, are known primarily to affect toddlers and children. One such condition is called disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD).",
        "DMDD causes children to experience unstable emotions they cannot regulate, including extreme outbursts of anger, leading to temper tantrums. These outbursts often occur in response to something a child doesn’t like, including baths, hair brushing, doctor visits, bus rides, and more. Additionally, children with DMDD are more susceptible to developing other mood disorders.",
        "DMDD is sometimes confused with simply being in a bad mood, but the two have stark differences. Children can overcome bad attitudes fairly quickly and easily, whereas children with DMDD often cannot do so.",
        "Due to their emotionally intense nature, children with DMDD often have issues at home, school, and other social settings. They may have difficulty making friends. They may also experience more frequent trips to health care providers or faced suspension from school."
