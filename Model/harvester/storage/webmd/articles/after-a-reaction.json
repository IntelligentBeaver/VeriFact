        "After you have an allergic reaction, it can sometimes feel like you no longer have the confidence to eat out and that the anxiety is getting the better of you. Honestly, this happens to the best of us. An allergic reaction can so quickly and easily shatter the confidence you have built up, and it’s not so easy to start putting the pieces back together.",
        "Reactions can be so traumatizing that they have a devastating effect on your mental health. The FARE Patient Registry included 1,680 patients and caregivers in a study that showed about two-thirds of patients reported mental health concerns related to food allergies (62%). These included anxiety after a reaction, anxiety about living with food allergies, and concerns about food avoidance. I have experienced these feelings first-hand, so hopefully I can give some insight to help you get back on your feet and gain your confidence again.",
        "What Happened to Me",
        "One of the worst reactions I had was when I was 15 years old. The reaction occurred shortly after I ate chips from a takeaway restaurant, not knowing that they were cooked in peanut oil."

        "The immediate step after a severe allergic reaction would be to take your antihistamine to see if the hives calm down. In my case, the hives actually didn’t appear right away – which was surprising, as they are usually my body’s first red flag that I’m reacting to something. This is something I’ve learned as I’ve gotten older and gained understanding about how I react when I have a reaction. If hives do occur, I will look out for tingling on my lips. And from there, well, it’s kind of a beeline to throat swelling and anaphylaxis.",
        "Looking back at this allergic reaction, I think my mum could have administered the epinephrine pen earlier. However, at the time, in the ’90s, there was a lack of understanding about allergies in comparison to now. In my case, by the time I got to the hospital, they put me straight on an IV so the medication could enter my bloodstream faster."

        "My advice would be don’t hesitate to use epinephrine if a reaction gets worse. It's always best to use it earlier than late. There is no harm to using it, so don’t ever feel scared to use it – especially in a potentially life-and-death situation.",
        "Reach Out to Others",
        "After an allergic reaction, your feelings of stress and anxiety can be heightened and it can feel downright scary. You may feel like no one understands exactly what you are feeling, which only makes it seem more isolating. But trust me, someone will always be willing to listen and might understand more than you think. It’s important to speak to a friend or family member about how you’re feeling so you can get the support you need and feel less alone.",
        "Personally, I would reach out to people in the food allergies community on Instagram and get their support. I’m sure you will come across someone like yourself who has experienced the same feelings and anxieties after a reaction. Speaking with someone who understands and knows how you feel can help massively. Getting this kind of community support is so helpful, and it’s free, so make sure you make use of social media."

It helped me get a better understanding of my allergy anxiety and how I could manage it effectively on the trip. I knew I would have fewer resources there, and be spending time in rural environments.",

This wasn’t something I was aware about until our sessions, and I had actually struggled to find a therapist with expertise in allergies. Frustratingly, there aren’t many who specialize in this area. But don’t let this get you down, as many others can still give you tools to cope after a reaction."
