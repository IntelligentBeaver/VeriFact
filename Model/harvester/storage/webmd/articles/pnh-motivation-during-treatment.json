        "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) can cause headaches, a racing heart, chest pain , and fatigue. In more severe cases, it can cause trouble swallowing, stomach contractions , and spasms in your throat. Treatments for PNH are aimed at reducing your symptoms. You might need to take multiple medications and have ongoing doctor’s appointments as part of your treatment. Managing your symptoms and treatments could leave you feeling overwhelmed. Try these tips to stay motivated when PNH treatment becomes difficult. Learning that you have PNH can be scary. It’s important to learn about the disease and understand the causes, symptoms, and treatment options — but don’t put too much pressure on yourself to learn everything right away. As you find out new information, including details about other available PNH treatments or clinical trials , make notes and write down questions to ask your doctor at your next appointment. Take charge. PNH medications can cause side effects ranging from stomach pain, diarrhea , and nausea to headaches and skin reactions where the needle went in. Having a plan to manage side effects can help make treatment easier. Your plan might include: Eating several smaller meals to prevent an upset stomach Preparing meals that are high in protein and calories Applying ice to your injection site to ease pain Taking over-the-counter pain relievers for injection site pain Staying hydrated to ease headaches Using over-the-counter pain meds for injection site reactions Drinking lots of water or beverages with electrolytes for diarrhea Avoiding spicy and fatty foods, dairy products, and caffeinated drinks that could make your upset stomach worse"

Rest gives your body a chance to recharge and can improve your energy levels and your mood so that you can continue managing your disease. Aim to get 7-8 hours of sleep per night. You can increase the odds of getting a restful night of sleep by going to bed and waking up around the same time each day. It can also help to avoid alcohol, caffeine , and screen time before bed."
