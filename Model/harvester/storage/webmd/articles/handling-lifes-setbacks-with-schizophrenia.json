        "But with schizophrenia, setbacks can also cause your symptoms to spiral out of control.",
        "I’ve had a number of setbacks in life. I had financial struggles and was on the verge of bankruptcy. I experienced the loss of multiple romantic relationships. I had my share of rejection letters for scholarships and jobs that I applied for, and I was fired from a job.",
        "None of these were wanted and they were difficult to navigate. There were times a setback completely knocked the wind out of me.",
        "Even though I was medication-compliant, my symptoms were heightened. I’m fortunate to have protective factors and coping skills that help me manage stress, so my symptoms don’t resurface.",
        "Protective factors include my support network. I tap into family, friends, and a team of psychiatric professionals to wrap me with support. They help me process what I’m going through so I don’t isolate myself and get lost in negative thoughts."

I use journaling to transfer my thoughts and feelings to the page, reduce stress, and better understand the situation I’m in.",

Loki keeps me on my toes and makes me more responsible. I have a living being counting on me to survive and stay well."
