        "Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) inflames and damages the small tubes (ducts) in your liver that carry the digestive fluid bile. At first, you might not have any symptoms or problems from the disease. But as bile builds up, it can scar and damage your liver. Getting on an effective treatment can slow the disease’s progression to severe liver scarring, or cirrhosis. It may help delay liver failure and the need for a liver transplant. Ursodeoxycholic acid (also called ursodiol and UDCA) is often the first medicine doctors prescribe for PBC. UDCA helps clear bile from your liver. This medicine doesn't cure PBC, but it can slow the disease and reduce liver damage. If UDCA doesn't help, you do have other options to manage your condition. It's important to tell your doctor if your symptoms don't get better so they can adjust your treatment."

        "UDCA may not work as well if you: Have cirrhosis Have high levels of the liver enzymes gamma-glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase Were assigned male at birth Were assigned female at birth and were younger than 45 when you were diagnosed with PBC You may notice symptoms like these if your condition isn't under good control: Tiredness Itchy skin Yellow skin and eyes Dry eyes and mouth Pain in the upper right part of your belly Bone, muscle, or joint pain Swelling in your feet, ankles, and belly Your doctor will do blood tests once every 3 to 6 months, although it takes about a year on treatment to know whether the medicine is working for you. The tests check levels of liver enzymes like alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin in your blood. Higher-than-normal amounts of these substances are a sign that your disease has gotten worse and your liver is damaged. If your liver enzyme levels are high, your doctor might add another medicine to lower them. Researchers are studying new markers in the genes or blood that might help them predict which people won't respond to treatment or will progress to liver failure more quickly. Anyone who is at risk of progressing could then get more frequent follow-ups and other treatments to prevent their disease from getting worse."
