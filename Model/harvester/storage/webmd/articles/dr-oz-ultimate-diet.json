        "Like any good physician, Oz has obviously read through the nutritional guidelines of the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association. The main concepts of his diet plan are spot-on with many of their recommendations. You will likely lose weight and be on the road to better health if you follow his plan.",
        "Oz includes the fundamental elements of a sound diet: enjoyable eating and healthy food choices. His \"Rule of 5s\" is sure to knock most processed foods out of your cabinets, and with it much of the added salt, fat, and empty calories.",
        "Is It Good for Certain Conditions?",
        "Diets that are low in salt and fat are good for your heart health and blood pressure , and so is any needed weight loss. Your cholesterol levels will likely fall with this type of mindful eating, as well.",
        "Weight loss and exercise are also proven to help prevent and treat diabetes . If you have diabetes, any drastic change in your diet or in your activity level means that you may need to adjust your diabetes treatment plan to avoid hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar ). Talk with your doctor or dietitian for guidance.",
        "The diet allows for low-fat dairy, low-fat animal protein, and fish. It also packs in plenty of fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Fiber will help keep your cholesterol level down, and it's good for your digestive system .",
        "Dr. Oz’s Ultimate Diet includes about 30 minutes of aerobic activity on most days. This is also what the American Heart Association recommends. But the plan does fall a little short with strength training . Both the American Heart Association and the CDC say you should fit this in at least twice a week.",
        "Oz recommends that everyone see their doctor before starting his diet- exercise plan .",
        "The Final Word",
        "The most painful part of Dr. Oz’s Ultimate Diet may well be the purging of your cabinets.",
        "Stocking your kitchen with the diet’s shopping list is sure to be pricey at first, but after that, it shouldn’t be more than you would normally spend on your groceries. Any expensive items may be balanced out by your savings from having cut out fatty cuts of meats and prepared foods.",
        "Be prepared to do your own cooking, as it will be much easier to follow the diet if you do. Eating out may present a challenge, since you have little control over the ingredients.",
