        "The history of HIV in the U.S. spans more than four decades. In 1981, reports of strange illnesses began emerging in New York and California. Previously healthy young gay men were suddenly affected by Kaposi’s sarcoma , a rare, fast-growing cancer typically seen in older males or those with weakened immune systems.",
        "By the end of 1981, 337 cases of severe immune deficiency were reported, affecting adults, teens, and children under 13 (including babies).",
        "A year later, the CDC named the mysterious disease acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS . Once the virus took hold in your body, it attacked your immune system. If you developed AIDS (the last stage of HIV), you could no longer fight any infections. Before effective HIV treatments were available, people often faced the risk of death within a year of diagnosis.",
        "Since mostly gay men were getting sick, health officials and the public often referred to HIV as “gay cancer.” The stigma linking HIV to the LGBTQ+ community led to poor funding for treatment and unfair treatment for those diagnosed with the virus in areas such as housing, work, and other parts of society."
