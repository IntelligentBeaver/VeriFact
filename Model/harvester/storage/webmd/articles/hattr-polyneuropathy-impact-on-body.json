        "Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) can cause serious, even debilitating symptoms in a number of your body’s organs and systems. It’s caused by a gene mutation, or change, that’s passed down through families. The mutation affects the way your body makes the protein transthyretin (TTR). The TTR protein molecules form into the wrong shape. That causes them to clump together into a substance called amyloid. Deposits of amyloid build up in your organs and other tissues, causing problems over time. The parts of your body most often affected are your nerves, heart, digestive system, kidneys, and eyes."

Your peripheral nervous system has two main parts: Somatic nervous system. These nerves send sense signals like touch, heat, and pain to your brain. They also help you move your muscles. Autonomic nervous system . These nerves control basic body functions you do without thinking, like breathing and digestion."

        "Amyloid deposits cause your nerve fibers to break down. It usually starts with the smallest nerve fibers, which have the least protection. In your somatic nervous system, they’re responsible for pain and how your body feels temperature. Symptoms usually begin in your feet and hands and travel up your limbs. They can include: Pain Tingling Burning Being more sensitive to pain and touch Being less sensitive to heat As it progresses, hATTR damage moves to larger nerve fibers that sense vibration and the position of your joints, and control your muscle movements. That can cause: Numbness Muscle weakness Restless legs syndrome Loss of coordination Loss of balance Trouble walking When nerves in your autonomic nervous system get damaged, you can have symptoms such as: Dizziness when you stand Irregular heartbeats Sexual problems A lot of sweating Diarrhea, constipation, or both Trouble peeing Dry mouth hATTR can also cause nerve problems by making tissues swell that then press on nerves. One of the first symptoms many people with hATTR have is carpal tunnel syndrome. It comes from compression of the nerves that run through your wrists to your hands. You may feel pain, tingling, and numbness in your fingers, hands, and wrists. You may have a weak grip and drop things. At first, it may come and go, but you’ll eventually feel it all the time."
