        "Eczema is a condition that causes patches of dry, itchy skin and other uncomfortable symptoms. It can occur anywhere on your body, including your hands. You also may hear hand eczema referred to as hand dermatitis. Dermatitis is a broad category of conditions that trigger inflammation on your skin. Hand eczema is not just uncomfortable. It can make some everyday tasks difficult, such as buttoning a shirt, typing, writing, and much more. It also can have a serious emotional impact. People with hand eczema may withdraw from their social lives because they feel embarrassed and stigmatized. This boosts their risk of both depression and anxiety. There are several different types of hand eczema. Some types are acute, meaning they last for only a short period before clearing up, but in up to 2 out of 3 people who develop it, hand eczema becomes chronic, which experts define as lasting for three months or longer or recurring at least twice within 12 months. An estimated 5% to 15% of people have hand eczema at some point in their lives. It’s among the most common types of eczema."

Irritant contact dermatitis. This is the most common type of hand eczema. It’s often triggered by contact with harsh chemicals, which can damage the protective outer layer of skin on your hands.

Atopic hand eczema also can be caused by allergens in your environment. If you have atopic hand eczema, you have a higher risk of both irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. Dyshidrotic eczema. This type of eczema, which can develop on your fingers and hands as well as your feet, causes some different symptoms than the other common types of hand eczema. Its standout feature is small, painful blisters. Itchy, scaly skin can form on or around the blisters, and your skin can become dry and cracked as those blisters go away. Experts don’t know what causes it, but it’s likely a combination of genetics and allergies as well as having frequently sweaty or wet hands. Other names for it include: Dyshydrosis Acute palmoplantar eczema Vesiculobullous dermatitis Pompholyx Acute recurrent vesicular hand dermatitis Hyperkeratotic hand eczema. Not as common as the other types of hand eczema, this one usually causes patches of thick, cracked skin to form on the palms of your hands. It also can affect the soles of your feet. Unlike other types of hand eczema, it causes little or no redness of the skin. Experts don’t know what causes it."

        "Moisturizers and creams help maintain the protective barrier formed by your skin’s top layers. By keeping your skin hydrated, you help to prevent allergens and irritants from getting into your skin and causing symptoms. Your doctor can recommend or prescribe an effective moisturizer or cream. Make sure to moisturize every time you wash your hands or bathe. Vigorous hand washing can irritate your skin and worsen your symptoms. Follow these steps to keep your hands clean without agitating your eczema: Use lukewarm water, not hot water. Use a gentle soap, lathering your hands all over, including between your fingers and around your nails, for 20 seconds. Rinse thoroughly, making sure you don’t leave any soap on your hands. To dry your hands, pat with a clean, soft towel or use paper towels. Moisturize right away. Apply a generous amount of your moisturizer to your hands before they’re completely dry. Do this every time you wash your hands."
