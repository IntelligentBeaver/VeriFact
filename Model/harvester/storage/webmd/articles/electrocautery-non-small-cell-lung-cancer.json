Other endobronchial therapies include photodynamic (light) therapy, cryotherapy (cold therapy), and laser therapy.

Brachytherapy is a type of radiation treatment that places radioactive material into the body. Endobronchial therapies can sometimes cure very early-stage lung cancers.

Segmentectomy is a treatment for early-stage cancers (stage 0 or I) that are only in a small area of the lung. It's also an option for people who aren't healthy enough to have more extensive lobectomy surgery, which removes a whole lobe of the lung."
