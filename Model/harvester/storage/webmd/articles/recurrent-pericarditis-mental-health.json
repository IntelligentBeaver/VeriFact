        "Living with recurrent pericarditis can be stressful. You may often find that you worry that you’ll have another episode or avoid activities like exercise because you fear that they’ll trigger symptoms. In addition, recurrent pericarditis may last for years. These recurrences can have significant effects on your everyday life. One small study of 83 adults with recurrent pericarditis found that living with the condition affects not just physical and mental health , but also sleep quality and work productivity. People with recurrent pericarditis often focus on their physical health, especially their heart health, but it’s important to manage mental health, too. Here’s a closer look at why it’s so key to manage emotions like fear, uncertainty, and anxiety when you have recurrent pericarditis."

In short-term stressful situations, this is a good thing. It’s known as the “fight or flight response.” But when it goes on for days or weeks, it can be harmful. It raises your blood pressure, which in turn increases your chances of a heart attack or stroke ."
