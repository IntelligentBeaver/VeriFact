        "Day care centers are offering more than just babysitting services. Just ask Laarni Camerino, mother of three young boys. When she drops off her kids at Palcare in Burlingame, Calif., she knows they get a good education, take part in fun activities such as painting, and eat a nutritious hot lunch.",
        "All the perks equally excite the 36-year-old mom. Shortly after she brags about her 6-year-old son's ability to read at a second grade level, the civil engineer gushes about the time she saves every night, not having to prepare lunch and snacks, and to clean Tupperware from the day's meals.",
        "Palcare's flexible and extended hours also give Camerino the option to take a night off with her husband, to adjust work hours according to her family's needs, and to have extra assurance that her kids are safe. \"Because parents are always in and out of there, I think it keeps the place on their toes ,\" she tells WebMD.",
        "Camerino is one of a growing number of moms discovering the benefits of today's child care . When parents bring their kids to The Little Leprechaun Academy in Mason, Ohio, they can also drop off their dry cleaning, get free Starbucks coffee, and, when they get to the office, check the center's live classroom camera via the Internet."
