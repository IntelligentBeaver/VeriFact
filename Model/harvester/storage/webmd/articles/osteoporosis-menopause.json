        "Exercise . Establish a regular exercise program . Exercise makes bones and muscles stronger and helps prevent bone loss. It also helps you stay active and mobile. Weight-bearing exercises, done at least three to four times a week, are best for preventing osteoporosis. Walking, jogging , playing tennis, and dancing are all good weight-bearing exercises. In addition, strength and balance exercises may help you avoid falls, decreasing your chance of breaking a bone.",
        "Eat foods high in calcium . Getting enough calcium throughout your life helps to build and keep strong bones. The U.S. recommended daily allowance (RDA) of calcium for adults with a low-to-average risk of developing osteoporosis is 1,000 mg (milligrams) each day. For those at high risk of developing osteoporosis, such as postmenopausal women and men, the RDA increases up to 1,200 mg each day. Excellent sources of calcium are milk and dairy products (low-fat versions are recommended), canned fish with bones like salmon and sardines, dark green leafy vegetables, such as kale, collards and broccoli, calcium-fortified orange juice, and breads made with calcium-fortified flour.",
        "Supplements . If you think you need to take a supplement to get enough calcium, check with your doctor first. Calcium carbonate and calcium citrate are good forms of calcium supplements. Be careful not to get more than 2,000 mg of calcium a day if you are 51 or older. Younger adults may be able to tolerate up to 2500 mg a day but check with your doctor. Too much can increase the chance of developing kidney stones .",
        "Vitamin D . Your body uses vitamin D to absorb calcium. Being out in the sun for a total of 20 minutes every day helps most people's bodies make enough vitamin D. You can also get vitamin D from eggs, fatty fish like salmon, cereal and milk fortified with vitamin D, as well as from supplements. People aged 51 to 70 should have 600 IU daily. More than 4,000 IU of vitamin D each day is not recommended. Talk to your doctor to see how much is right for you because it may harm your kidneys and even lower bone mass.",

Replacing est rogen lost after menopause (when the ovaries stop most of their production of estrogen) slows bone loss and improves the body's absorption and retention of calcium. But, because estrogen therapy carries risks, it is only recommended for women at high risk for osteoporosis and/or severe menopausal symptoms. To learn more, talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of estrogen therapy.",
        "Know the high risk medications. Steroids, some breast cancer treatments (such as aromatase inhibitors), drugs used to treat seizures (anticonvulsants), blood thinners (anticoagulants), and thyroid medications can increase the rate of bone loss. If you are taking any of these drugs, speak with your doctor about how to reduce your risk of bone loss through diet, lifestyle changes and, possibly, additional medication.",
