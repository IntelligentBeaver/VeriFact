        "Each season, female brown widow spiders lay several egg sacs, each with 120 to 150 eggs. The egg sacs are distinctive, with silky spikes projecting from the surface, much like a thistle.",
        "Young spiders called spiderlings hatch from the eggs in 14 to 21 days but stay hidden in the egg sac for a few days to a month. Once they emerge, some stay in the area and may eat a few of their siblings. Many of the remaining spiderlings will spread to nearby areas by ballooning, or using their webs to sail through the air.",
        "After reaching adulthood, the brown widow spiders mate. The female will often kill the male — a common practice among widow spiders, and how they got their name. Male brown widow spiders live for six months to a year. Female brown widow spiders live for up to three years and produce about 5,000 young each season."
