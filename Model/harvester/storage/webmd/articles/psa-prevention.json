        "Are you cautious about exercise? Get out there. Just make sure you stick with what your doctor says is OK for you -- probably low-impact activities like walking, swimming, or biking. Make sure you pace yourself, too. When you make exercise a habit, you can: Ease arthritis symptoms. Improve how you move. Get stronger and more flexible. Keep your weight healthy, which takes pressure off your joints. Help your heart. Boost your mood. Give yourself more energy. You can work out on your own or with the help of a physical therapist . Warm up first, so your muscles can ease into it. One of your best options is water therapy, also called hydrotherapy or aqua therapy. It’s an exercise program held in a pool. The water takes some of the weight off your joints, so it may be easier for you to do well. Whatever exercise you choose, make sure it’s one you'll like enough to do it regularly. Also, try to be active throughout your day. You can garden, give the dog an extra walk, and fit in some stretches while you’re at your kid’s sports practice."

Pace yourself. Switch between heavy, hard, or repetitive tasks and light or easy tasks. Make sure you take breaks. 2. Be kind to your joints. Put as little stress on them as possible. Use larger, stronger joints when you can, instead of smaller ones. For example, wear a shoulder bag rather than a handheld purse."
