        "The migraine I'd been suffering for two weeks was nothing compared to the searing pain that suddenly shot through the left side of my head as I lay sleeping in bed one night. It was a pain as intense as any I've ever felt. It woke me from a deep sleep and left me sitting bolt upright, trembling, and holding the side of my head.",
        "Frightened and unsure what to do, I got out of bed at 3 a.m. and drove myself to the emergency room of my HMO. I'd been at the hospital two days earlier to get some help for my migraines. The doctor at the walk-in clinic had given me a thorough exam and asked me if I was taking any medications . I'd told him about my new estrogen drug, Prempro , which I'd started taking the day before the headaches began. He'd given me a prescription for Midrin , a vasoconstrictor commonly used for migraines , and another for my blood pressure , which, he'd noted, was elevated. \"The estrogen you're taking is fine,\" he'd told me. \"You just have a migraine.\"",
        "Now, just two days later, I was back at the hospital, and I was feeling scared. The ER doctor gave me a cursory exam and expressed concern about my blood pressure, which was now up to 220/100. He said he was glad I was taking blood pressure medication, assured me that all my medications were correct, and sent me on my way."
