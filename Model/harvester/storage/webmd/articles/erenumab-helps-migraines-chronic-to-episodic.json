        "New research shows that erenumab , sold under the brand name Aimovig, helps people with chronic migraines convert to an episodic pattern shortly after starting the medicine. In this trial, 71% of people with chronic migraines who were treated for one year converted to episodic migraines. Erenumab was also associated with improvement in the headaches that did occur. The improvement was noticed after the first treatment and continued over the course of the trial.",
        "Erenumab is an anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibody. This is the first preventative treatment developed specifically for the treatment of migraines. During a migraine , your nerves and blood vessels release CGRP, a protein in the brain that has a role in the transmission of pain. Erenumab works by blocking the action of CGRP, which prevents migraine from forming.",
        "Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that are all grown from the same genetic material. They can precisely target specific processes in your body. They are most well-known for their use in vaccines to help prevent or fight infections. These antibodies remain active and work in your body for weeks or months. In the case of erenumab, it's usually given as a monthly dose."
