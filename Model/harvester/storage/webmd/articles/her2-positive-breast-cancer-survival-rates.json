        "If you or someone you love has HER2+ breast cancer, you’ll have a lot of questions. What will treatment look like? Will doctors be able to cure the cancer? How will it affect your quality of life?",
        "One thing to keep in mind is that the numbers you find online can’t tell you about you or a loved one specifically. These numbers are averages based on many women who’ve found out they had breast cancer in the past. Because each woman is different, they can’t tell you exactly what will happen to you or any particular woman.",
        "The chance of a cure or putting the disease into remission depends a lot on how advanced the cancer is when treatment starts. If it’s only in the breast, that’s much better than if it has already spread to other parts of the body. A cure or remission will depend on treatment and how well the cancer responds to treatment. The chances of survival also depend on your age and general health.",
        "The fact that the cancer is positive for HER2 will affect your treatment and survival. Experts consider the HER2+ breast cancer to be more aggressive than some other breast cancers. That means it may grow faster without treatment. The good news is that treatment for the HER2+ type has improved, so the outlook for you or a loved one is likely better than what some of the numbers show."
