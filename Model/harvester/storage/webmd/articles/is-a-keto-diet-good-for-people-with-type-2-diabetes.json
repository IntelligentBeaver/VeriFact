        "What Is a Keto Diet?",
        "A ketogenic diet, commonly referred to as a “keto diet,” is a low-carb, moderate protein, high-fat eating pattern designed to induce ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that occurs when the body burns fat instead of glucose for energy. Initially, the diet was prescribed for people with seizures and consisted of a 4:1 ratio of fat-to-carbohydrates plus protein. Nowadays, there are a few variations to eating keto, but all restrict the overall intake of carbohydrates.",

        "What Are Keto Diet Advantages?",
        "A keto diet can result in rapid weight loss by reducing carbohydrate intake. Foods such as bread, rice, pasta, beans, starchy produce, desserts, and sweetened beverages are all off-limits. Naysayers may say a caloric restriction in any food group can lead to weight loss. Still, some researchers say the metabolic effects of food, rather than the calories of specific foods, are the key to determining body weight over the long term, and carbohydrate restriction is more effective than fat restriction for weight loss treatment.",
        "What Are Keto Diet Disadvantages?",
        "While a keto diet may have its advantages for weight loss, it also has disadvantages -- especially for people with type 2 diabetes. A 2022 journal article suggests that a keto diet may cause low blood sugars. This is especially true for people who have diabetes and are on insulin or oral medications that may result in hypoglycemia."
