        "Feb. 27, 2025 - Migraine isn't just a bad headache – it’s a complex neurological condition that can leave you sidelined for days. What are certain triggers for migraine? What are the treatment options? We spoke with Cynthia E. Armand, MD , associate professor of neurology at Montefiore Medical Center, who helps us break down what makes migraine different from headaches, the certain triggers that can set off an attack, and how tracking symptoms can be the key to managing them. Plus, we dive into treatment options, from over-the-counter meds to cutting-edge neuromodulation devices. Tune in for expert insights on taking control of migraine and finding relief."

        "You already know that a migraine is not just a passing discomfort. Maybe you've only thought of migraine as really bad headaches, but if you've had to barricade yourself in a dark room while your head pounds and your stomach churns, you know firsthand That there's so much more going on what distinguishes a garden variety headache from the world of migraine And why do some people endure bouts of vision changes, nausea, or even days of lingering pain? In today's episode, we're tackling these questions head-on. We'll explore how migraine develops, why your brain may be more revved up than usual, and why triggers like certain foods, stress, or even weather can set off a domino effect of debilitating symptoms.",
        "We'll also dig into the many tools and treatments that can bring real relief from lifestyle tweaks like better sleep routines to targeted medications and emerging approaches like neuromodulation devices. We'll talk about what's safe to try on your own when you should consider a specialist. And how to create a personalized migraine toolkit that puts you rather than your pain in control."

I think where this started with my fascination with the brain and the nerves the entire nervous system when I was in medical school, and when I went to residency training, I began to understand the sense of scared neurologic patients are, especially when you're trying to explain to them something that doesn't quite necessarily make sense to them because you can't really see it, but they know they're not functioning well and what that means for the rest of their lives, their prognosis and how they can live well. And I began to fall in love with headache medicine because there were two worlds I was seeing. I was seeing the world of devastation for someone living with an invisible disability that can't necessarily be seen as a problem. You don't have a broken arm or a leg. You don't have a cast. You don't have a wheelchair, and in cases and really, they live to prove to the world that something is wrong.",

What are the treatment options? We spoke with Cynthia E. Armand, MD, associate professor of neurology at Montefiore Medical Center, who helps us break down what makes migraine different from headaches, the certain triggers that can set off an attack, and how tracking symptoms can be the key to managing them. Plus, we dive into treatment options, from over-the-counter meds to cutting-edge neuromodulation devices. Tune in for expert insights on taking control of migraine and finding relief.",
