        "Medication may be an important part of your treatment plan for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Doctors can choose from many types of drugs to control your symptoms. Whichever ADHD medication you and your doctor choose, they mostly work the same – to increase levels of certain chemicals in your brain (called neurotransmitters). These chemicals help reduce symptoms (such as hyperactivity and impulsivity), increase attention span, and help you manage your emotions.",

The American Heart Association recommends that all people, including children, have their heart evaluated before starting stimulants. They recommend doctors ask about the patient's medical and family history, specifically about symptoms that could suggest a heart condition.",

An EKG is a quick, painless test that measures your heart’s electrical activity. It’s used to test for potentially dangerous abnormal heart rhythms, or arrhythmias, and other heart problems.
