        "Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an autoimmune disease that can cause persistent joint pain, which can be chronic. The pain can be mild to severe and can affect any part of the body, including the spine and fingertips. Also present are stiffness, swelling, tenderness, and fatigue. With PsA, the immune system attacks healthy tissue, causing chronic inflammation and tissue damage. The damage can lead to irreversible joint damage and disability if it isn’t treated correctly or quickly. The damage causes pain, and some people with PsA also have other types of arthritis like osteoarthritis, which can complicate PsA. All of this leads to chronic pain. PsA can cause pain at the points where tendons and ligaments attach to the bones. It is especially true at the back of the heel (Achilles tendinitis) or at the sole of the foot (plantar fasciitis). Some people have chronic low back pain, spondylitis, because of PsA.",
        "Medications can ease pain, reduce inflammation, as well as slow down the progression of the disease. Physical and occupational therapies can help with everyday tasks and mobility. Surgery can replace damaged joints and tissue. Lifestyle changes can help reduce pressure on joints, ease pain, and improve mood. Such changes can include losing weight, gentle exercising, and healthy eating."

        "For me, PsA pain feels like tenderness in my joints. It hurts to touch them. It is accompanied by painful, red, swollen joints. My joints are stiff, especially when I wake up in the morning. And I have pain from psoriasis on my skin as well. It is a burning itch. I also have nail changes and extreme fatigue. My pain and fatigue worsen with a flare, and my flares may last a few weeks to a few months long.",
        "Currently, with the change of the season, my pain has increased with a flare. My joints are swollen, stiff, tender, and very painful. I have a few fingers and toes that are painful with the entire digits swollen. I have severe lower back pain with limited range of motion. The pain in my Achilles heels and the soles of my feet have also increased. My psoriasis has spread and is itchy and painful as well. I have pain in my eyes due to uveitis and pain in my abdomen due to inflammatory bowel disease caused by my PsA. My pain levels have increased throughout my entire body. I am in severe discomfort."

        "I experience chronic severe pain in the small joints of my hands and my feet. I also have pain in my wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, hips, and lower back. Because it is chronic inflammatory pain, I find that when I move around, the pain lessens. Sitting for prolonged periods or standing still for an extended period causes increased pain and stiffness. Anti-inflammatory medications like NSAIDs as well as DMARDs and biologics help to decrease pain and inflammation. I have noticed that my fatigue goes up when my pain goes up. So, if I have a higher degree of pain, I also have an increase in fatigue. I have had to change my medications a few times for them to remain effective at treating my pain and fatigue.",
        "PsA chronic pain comes to me like the waves of the ocean. The waves are always present. Sometimes the waves are smaller and less destructive to the shoreline. Other times the waves come in hard and fierce and tear down the shoreline with such anger and force. Even if you can’t see the waves, you can always hear them in the background. They are always present. They never stop beating down on the shoreline. I have days when the pain is small, and I can almost ignore it. I have other days when the pain is so powerful, I feel like there is nothing else I can do after medications, PT, OT, massage, TENS, ice, heat, etc. Sometimes, prayers are all I have left. I can always feel the pain. It is always there. I know that if I push myself too hard, the pain will come out with the same hard and fierce force of the angry waves. The pain is all over my body, just as the waves are all up and down the shoreline, hitting the land at different points with different forces.",
        "Because chronic pain is especially subjective, it is impossible to explain to another person what it feels like to experience specific pain. We can use metaphors, words, expressions, pictures, etc., but no one can know exactly how another person’s chronic pain feels. I don’t want anyone to experience what I feel, so I am OK with it being subjective. I do wish that our health care system would be less objective when it comes to taking care of people with chronic pain. Many times in my past, I was treated like I didn’t appear to be in pain, or I looked well. I was told that a 10 is emergency room pain, and I was in an emergency room with pain. Hmmm. ... I know we still have so far to go when it comes to treating chronic pain, and I hope and pray that we get to that point in my lifetime so I can experience a few days pain-free."
