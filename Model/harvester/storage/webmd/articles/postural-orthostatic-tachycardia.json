        "Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder in which most of your blood stays in your lower body when you stand up, and in response, your heart rate jumps.",
        "Your blood usually flows at a steady rate whether you're sitting, standing, lying down, or hanging upside-down from a tree branch in the backyard. But if that rate changes when you change positions, that's a condition called orthostatic intolerance. It's the most common symptom of POTS. It can make you feel dizzy, lightheaded, or faint.",
        "POTS makes your heart beat faster to try to get blood to your brain. Your heart rate can go up by 30 beats or more a minute after you stand. As that happens, your blood pressure is likely to drop.",
        "It affects about 1-3 million people in the U.S. Most people get better, but some people have symptoms that come and go over a number of years. About 25% of people with POTS have symptoms that make it difficult to work."

        "Is POTS a serious condition?",
        "POTS can have a major impact on your life, but it's not life-threatening. The biggest risk is that you'll injure yourself in a fall. Most people with POTS improve, though you may still have symptoms on and off.",
        "What does POTS do to you?",
        "The symptoms of POTS vary from person to person. Because most of your blood stays in your lower body when you stand up, your heart beats faster trying to send blood to your brain. You might feel dizzy, nauseated, or too hot or cold . Some people with POTS are very tired and have cognitive problems, called \"brain fog.\" Because the symptoms are so varied and overlap with a lot of other conditions, POTS can be hard to diagnose."
