Fleas can cause skin infections and tapeworm infections, while ticks can lead to illnesses like Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Many of these diseases can also spread to people. “Fleas and ticks can transmit infectious diseases to pets or people when they take a blood meal,” says Kathleen Claussen, DVM, a small animal veterinary practitioner."
