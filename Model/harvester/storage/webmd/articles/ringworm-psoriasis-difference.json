        "The similarities. Psoriasis and ringworm can show up almost anywhere on your body. Psoriasis most often develops on the lower back, legs, elbows and knees, palms and soles, and the face and scalp. But you may also have patches on your eyelids, ears, lips, skinfolds, the tops of hands and feet, and even your nails.",
        "You can get ringworm almost anywhere, too. It’s often on the torso, buttocks, arms, and legs. It all depends on which part of your body came into contact with the fungus. Location also determines what the infection is called. For instance, there’s athlete’s foot or tinea pedis, jock itch or tinea cruris, and scalp ringworm or tinea capitis.",
        "The differences. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease, so it’s a systemic, or bodywide, condition. Your immune system is sending out the wrong signals, creating inflammation and causing skin cells to multiply too fast. You can treat psoriasis, but it’s never really cured. All it takes is a trigger to cause a new flare. On the other hand, because ringworm comes from an outside source (the fungus), once treated it’s usually gone, even if treatment takes weeks or months.",
        "Psoriasis is not contagious. You can’t pass it to someone or get it from someone. The opposite is true for ringworm. It’s very contagious. In fact, the most likely way to get it is from skin-to-skin contact with someone who has it."
