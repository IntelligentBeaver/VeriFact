        "When you have asthma, the airways in your lungs get narrow and swollen. They also make too much mucus. This sets off spasms in the tubes that let air in and out of your lungs (bronchial tubes). The spasms make it hard to breathe. You may also wheeze and cough. It’s an ongoing, lifelong condition. There are several types of asthma. Each type has different triggers. These can be things such as exercising too hard or stuff in the air like smoke or pollen. One type is a serious kind called eosinophilic asthma. It’s harder to control with typical medications. Science links it to higher levels of white blood cells called eosinophils . These cells are part of your immune system. They help to kill things that don’t belong in your body such as harmful bacteria . They also control inflammation . Researchers have found that the more eosinophils in your blood, the more likely you are to have a serious asthma attack. But they aren’t sure what causes their numbers to go up. They have learned that eosinophilic asthma is different from other forms of the condition in a few ways:"
