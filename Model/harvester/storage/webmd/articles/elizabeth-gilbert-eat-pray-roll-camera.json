The book stayed on the best-seller list for more than 155 weeks; the movie version opens in mid-August. WebMD the Magazine sent the acclaimed author questions recently -- about her relationships, her healthy-living philosophy, even her greatest fear -- and she wrote her responses, with the same insight, humor, and perspective that have made her books so popular."

When I'm alone, I have no trouble eating small portions of healthy food and never crave anything more. When I eat with my husband, I eat about twice as much food as I would eat alone. Add a few family members and friends into the mix and I really start to pack on the calories.
