        "You may have nausea and diarrhea when you have radiation to your belly. Mouth sores and swallowing problems are more common when radiation is focused on your head and your neck. Long-term side effects that can happen with radiation to different parts of your body are: Lung damage, breathing problems, heart problems, and a higher chance of lung and breast cancer Head and neck radiation: Thyroid and dental problems Brain radiation: Headache, memory loss, trouble focusing, and changes in your personality Abdomen radiation: Diabetes, lower fertility (in all genders), and early menopause Radiation therapy can also cause you to develop the bone condition known as osteoporosis. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer-fighting drug you get through an IV or you take by mouth. Most people with follicular lymphoma who need treatment will get this, either by itself or with other therapies. Side effects include: Low blood cell count . Too few blood cells can cause you to have extreme tiredness (fatigue), bleeding, and bruising, and make you more likely to get an infection. If you have a fever, contact your doctor or go to the hospital right away. Nerve damage. This is called neuropathy. It causes you to have numbness and tingling in your fingertips and toes. For some people, it never goes away. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). This is a serious condition that happens when your cancer cells break down and inundate your bloodstream with harmful chemicals and toxins. Without treatment, it can cause you to have heart rhythm problems, seizures, loss of muscle control, kidney failure, and even death."
