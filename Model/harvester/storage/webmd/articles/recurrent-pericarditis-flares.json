        "Besides the risk factors that lead to pericarditis, certain things can trigger its symptoms. Corticosteroids. These medications are commonly used to control pericarditis pain and fluid buildup around the heart in people who can't take NSAIDs or don't get help from them. Studies show that in some instances, they can cause the disease to flare up. Since your body may rely on them to manage symptoms, your doctor will take you off of them slowly if you need to stop this medication. Exercise. Exercise is shown to worsen pericarditis symptoms and could trigger a flare-up. A fast heartbeat, especially one that goes above 100 beats per minute, stresses the pericardium and causes it to become more inflamed."

Heat can strain anyone's heart, but it can be especially tough if you have a heart condition like recurrent pericarditis. Heat causes your heart to beat faster and pump harder as it tries to get heat out of your body through the skin. Sweating can put more stress on your heart since it draws more heat from the body, along with sodium , potassium , and other minerals. Your body needs these for muscle contractions, nerve transmission, and water balance. Sleep positions. Your chest pain could get worse depending on how you lie down.
