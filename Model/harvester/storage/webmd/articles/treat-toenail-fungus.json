        "Toenail fungus (the medical term is \" onychomycosis\") is a very common condition. You can get it from walking around a wet pool deck or locker room, or from sweating in shoes all day. Nail fungi love warm, moist environments. You'll know if you have toenail fungus from seeing white, brown, or yellow spots on your toenail. Over time, your nail might thicken and even start to lift from your toe.",
        "Nail fungus doesn't go away by itself. And if you don't treat it, there's a chance it could get worse and cause pain when you walk. It could also spread to other nails or through your body.",
        "Luckily, there are a number of ways to take care of it.",
        "Prescription toenail fungus treatments",
        "These include creams, sprays, and gels like ciclopirox (Penlac), efinaconazole (Jublia), and tavaborole (Kerydin). These are best for surface fungus, as the products don't penetrate your nail bed. It may take a year of daily use before you see the fungus go away. Your foot doctor ( podiatrist ) will likely trim your nail and file away its dead layers to help the product penetrate deeper into your nail. They may also take a piece of your nail and send it to the lab to make sure it’s really a fungus and to find out what type it is.",
