        "The blood disorder beta thalassemia can bring complications that include things like bone damage, heart problems, and slow growth in children. Treatment can help you or your child avoid many of these problems.",
        "Beta thalassemia lowers the amount of a protein in your body called hemoglobin. Hemoglobin helps red blood cells carry oxygen to your organs and tissues. If you or your child doesn't have enough hemoglobin, you can get anemia, which makes you tired and short of breath.",
        "Low oxygen and too much iron cause most beta thalassemia complications. Iron is a mineral your body uses to carry oxygen and keep your muscles healthy. In beta thalassemia, your intestines absorb more iron than normal. The blood transfusions you get to treat the disease also contain iron. All of that extra iron builds up in your heart, liver, and the glands that make hormones and damages these organs.",
        "The complications you or your child get depend in part on the type of beta thalassemia. \"Beta thalassemia minor\" is mild and usually doesn't cause problems. Anemia from \"beta thalassemia intermedia\" causes slowed growth in children, weak bones, and an enlarged spleen. \"Beta thalassemia major\" is the most serious type, and it can cause many complications, including slow growth in children, an enlarged spleen, heart and liver problems, and bone damage.",
        "If you're the parent of a child who has complications from beta thalassemia, talk to your friends and family to get the emotional backing you may need as you help your child manage their symptoms. If you find yourself getting anxious or stressed out, talk to your doctor. They can put you in touch with social workers or mental health professionals who can help."
