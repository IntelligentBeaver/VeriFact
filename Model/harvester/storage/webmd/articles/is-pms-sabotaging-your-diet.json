Taking in a few extra calories in rice cakes now will prevent you from raiding the icebox later on. Meals also should be high in complex carbs, such as whole-grain breads, pasta, and cereals. \"Eaten on an empty stomach , baked potatoes, even half a bagel or low-sugar cereals, will increase serotonin levels within an hour,\" Wurtman says.",
