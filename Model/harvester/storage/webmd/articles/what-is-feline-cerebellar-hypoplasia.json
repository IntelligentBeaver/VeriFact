        "A cerebellar hypoplasia cat is also known as a wobbly cat. This condition is one of the most common nervous system disorders in cats. It's caused by the underdevelopment or destruction of the cerebellum, a vital part of the brain. Although this can have many causes, the most frequent is the infection of a kitten in the womb with the feline parvovirus (also known as the feline infectious enteritis (FIE), feline distemper, and feline panleukopenia virus). Though an infection causes the condition, your cerebellar hypoplasia cat is not infectious to others."
