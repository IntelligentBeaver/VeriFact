        "Classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a serious genetic disorder found at birth or in early childhood. It causes problems with your adrenal glands, which make hormones your body needs to grow and develop. If your child is diagnosed with classic CAH, they’ll have to take steroids to replace those hormones for the rest of their lives. But side effects – some dangerous – are possible. Here’s what you need to know."

        "Classic CAH is usually diagnosed shortly after birth during a newborn screening panel, which checks for different conditions. If you already have a child with classic CAH, there’s a 1 in 4 chance you’ll have another child who has it. The most common form of classic CAH is caused by your child’s body not making enough of a substance called 21-hydroxylase. Their adrenal glands need it to make enough of certain hormones like cortisol and aldosterone. With classic CAH , the adrenal gland doesn’t make enough cortisol and makes more 17-hydroxylase and androgens than the body needs. It's rare, but CAH can also result from low 11-hydroxylase levels."

The two main steroids are: Babies born with CAH don’t make enough of the stress hormone cortisone, which helps regulate blood pressure, blood sugar, and energy levels. Fludrocortisone . This medication helps replace aldosterone, a hormone needed to maintain your body’s salt and water levels, as well as blood pressure. Treatment should begin as soon as possible. Most of the time, children with classic CAH do well on these medications. They may need more of them if their body is under a lot of physical stress because of illness, surgery, or injury.

The doctor will monitor them closely, ordering tests to make sure the treatment dosage is correct. It’s important to tell the doctor about signs of over- or undertreatment, such as early puberty, stretch marks, a sudden height or weight gain, or a fuller face. In addition to steroids to control excess androgens, if your child is 4 or older their doctor may also prescribe crinecerfont (Crenessity). This medication can lower their adrenal androgen output, and may result in them taking fewer steroids."
