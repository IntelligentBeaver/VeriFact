        "Each year during flu season, at least one in every 20 people in the U.S. will come down with influenza or flu . Some years, that number can be as high as one in every five. For most of us, getting the flu means several days of feeling pretty miserable. Headaches, body aches, high fevers, chills, fatigue , and exhaustion are all part of the disease running its course. But then most people recover on their own.",

The strains of influenza virus within the vaccines are chosen each year based on what scientists predict will be the circulating viruses for the flu season. Both types of vaccines cause the body's immune system to create antibodies that will ward off the influenza virus if it invades your body.",

That would include an illness that affects the immune system and people being treated with drugs or therapies that suppress the immune system.
