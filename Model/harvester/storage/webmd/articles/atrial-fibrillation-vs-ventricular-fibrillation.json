        "Atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation are both types of irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias). Atrial fibrillation (AFib) affects the two upper chambers of your heart. Ventricular fibrillation (VFib) affects the two lower chambers of the heart. As many as 6 million people in the U.S. have AFib, and the CDC says that could jump to 12 million by 2030. AFib is more common, and research has shown that AFib can triple your risk for getting VFib. VFib can be the far more dangerous of these two conditions."
