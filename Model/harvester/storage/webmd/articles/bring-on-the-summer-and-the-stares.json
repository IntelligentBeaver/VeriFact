        "To be clear, I think there’s a difference between people staring out of genuine curiosity and staring out of rudeness. While neither is particularly appropriate, I’ve gradually learned to decipher between the two.",
        "The first time I noticed people’s stares was in middle school. I got my ears pierced when I was in 5th grade and developed a keloid on the back of my ear a few years later. It was not only physically uncomfortable but also visually unappealing.",
        "My peers would always ask me, “What’s that?” Sometimes I’d wear my hair down or cover my ear with my hand during class to make it less noticeable. I eventually had it surgically removed in 7th grade, which was a huge relief – until it grew back. This time, it was smaller and didn’t bother me as much because I’d given up on wearing earrings, and it wasn’t noticeable enough for people to continue asking about it."

After my sarcoma removal surgery last year, I was left with a long, straight scar across my back and a large, round one on my left breast. The back scar is where my plastic surgeon took tissue for reconstruction."

Each stare now represents not just curiosity or rudeness but also a chance to share my journey and educate others about the power of self-advocacy. I hope to foster understanding and empathy, encouraging others to look beyond appearances and appreciate the stories that make us who we are."
