        "\"This oral therapy is a type of Ayurvedic medicine [a traditional Indian system] that dates back 3,000 years,\" says Jessica T. Emery, DMD, owner of Sugar Fix Dental Loft in Chicago. \"It involves swishing approximately 1 tablespoon of oil -- typically coconut, sesame, or sunflower oil -- in your mouth for about 20 minutes and then spitting it out.\"",

Recent studies show that oil pulling helps against gingivitis , plaque, and microorganisms that cause bad breath . How? \"Most microorganisms inhabiting the mouth consist of a single cell,\" Emery says. \"Cells are covered with a lipid, or fatty, membrane, which is the cell's skin . When these cells come into contact with oil, a fat, they naturally adhere to each other.\""

        "Don't skip brushing and flossing . \"Oil pulling should never replace routine dental visits and traditional home oral care,\" Emery says. \"It doesn't reverse the effects of tooth decay, but it's a great supplemental therapy.\""
