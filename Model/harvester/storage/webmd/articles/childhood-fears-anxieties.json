She studies how they make connections between the mind and emotions. Lagattuta explains that young children around age 4 or 5 do OK telling the imaginary from the real -- unless it is connected with something fearful. \"When the emotion is real, then it is hard for them to determine that the experience that goes with it isn't real, as well.\"",
