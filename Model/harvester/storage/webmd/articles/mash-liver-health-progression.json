        "First, don't be afraid to ask questions. I often counsel patients that the only dumb question is the one that they don't ask.",
        "“It's good to have another set of ears there, to catch things you don't catch.”",
        "Most labs have a patient portal. Sign up. This means that you'll have these results in hand for your appointment, so that you can discuss them with your medical provider.",
        "Make sure your doctor knows that you have specific questions about your liver health and your disease's progression that you want to address during the appointment. Remember that list of questions I suggested you get ready before your appointment? Have it in front of you, so you don't forget any of them. Be prepared for your doctor to ask you a few things, too.",
        "Most people with MASH need to see other specialists to stay on track of such things as heart or kidney issues.",
        "This may be especially true if your doctor isn't completely sure about your diagnosis. That's what happened to me. Initially, blood tests done over a decade ago showed I had a low platelet count, which could be caused by a number of things, including liver disease. Over the years, I went through dozens of tests before I got an actual diagnosis.",
        "As a MASH patient, I get blood drawn almost every month. It's important to look at the results to see if these numbers have changed at all, and if they have, what that could mean.",
        "Tell your doctor about any symptoms you notice, even if they don't seem connected to MASH. People with sleep apnea, for example, are three times more likely to have MASH. Other signs, like unexplained bruising, or red spots on your skin, can indicate that your liver disease is progressing.",
        "Your doctor will usually make their recommendations for follow-up visits and testing based on your most recent bloodwork and imaging. For me, that's usually every six months.",
        "“You should let your doctor know exactly how you're feeling, even if you don't think it's related.”",
        "Your doctor will want to know if you have pain, and how you feel in general. They'll also want to make sure that you don't have changes in appetite, or trouble sleeping or concentrating. This helps them get an overall picture of how well you're doing.",
        "Everyone diagnosed with MASH needs to avoid alcohol. It's very important to be truthful with your doctor. If you do drink, they can help you figure out ways to stop, and even refer you to counseling.",
        "Lack of exercise and a high-fat, high-sugar diet can worsen MASH. Your doctor can always refer you to a nutritionist to help you get your eating habits on track.",
        "Certain ones, such as high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes, can worsen MASH if they aren't well-controlled.",
        "It’s important to answer your doctor’s questions as completely and truthfully as possible. This will help them provide the best possible care.",
        "You know your own body, and you know when something is off. There are times that you may need to be proactive about your care: Here are some of them.",
        "Before you leave your doctor's office, book your follow-up appointment. But when you're home, do the following:",
        "Read your clinic notes. You may get some important information that you didn't get from your actual visit. This actually happened to me fairly recently. I came back from an appointment and saw that my doctor had noted that we should do another liver biopsy soon. I called his office and scheduled it right away. If I hadn't done that, he might not have brought it up for another six to 12 months.",
        "Find a support group . You can find them through the American Liver Foundation, or even through your local clinic. It's a safe space to talk about things, and even to unpack some of what your doctor said at your last visit.",
        "Take care of yourself. All the things that you do to improve your mental and physical health – stay at a healthy weight, get regular exercise, eat a healthy diet – can all help you manage your MASH, too. In general, doctors seem to recommend the Mediterranean diet, which is a plant-based eating program rich in fruits, veggies, fatty fish and good-for-you fats like nuts and olive oil."
