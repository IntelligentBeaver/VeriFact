        "When you have chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), your hives may come and go. Or you might have flare-ups almost every day for months or even years. The intense itching can interfere with work, school, or sleep. There’s no way to know how long you’ll have it, although there is about a 50/50 chance that your hives will go away within a year. Your doctor probably isn’t sure why you have CSU, either. In 80% to 90% of cases, no clear cause is found. On top of that, you may be among the nearly 50% of people with CSU who also have angioedema, painful or tingly swelling in your throat, lips, and eyelids. All of these things may make CSU tricky to manage. You and your doctor can try a number of types of medications to ease your symptoms. But there are plenty of other changes that might make a difference, too."

        "Most people with CSU take medications called antihistamines, and these usually control symptoms. But it’s crucial that you take them consistently, exactly as prescribed, says Jacquelyn Sink, MD, a dermatologist at Northwestern Medicine Regional Medical Group in Chicago. “Erratic, as-needed dosing or inconsistent use of antihistamines may contribute to breakthrough symptoms,” she says. Even if you don’t take antihistamines, it’s important to follow the treatment plan your doctor recommends as closely as you can. If you don’t, it won’t be effective."

For instance, if you’re taking an antihistamine, Aivaz says, your doctor can add another that works differently. If you’re still having problems, your doctor might have you take the antihistamine more than once a day.

        "Omalizumab targets immunoglobulin E (IgE), a protein that your immune system makes. It’s FDA-approved for people 12 and older who have CSU that isn’t controlled with antihistamines, Sink says. It’s injected under your skin every 4 weeks, either at your doctor’s office or at home. This is the medication doctors usually prefer, she says, because of effectiveness and safety. Remibreutinib blocks a protein called Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) which can stop your immune cells like mast cells from releasing certain inflammatory chemicals like histamine. The targeted therapy was approved to help calm your immune system and help ease the itch from CSU. Aivaz recommends adding any of these second-tier medications to the antihistamines you’re already taking, rather than replacing them. One medical treatment that doesn’t involve drugs is narrow-band ultraviolet light therapy, also known as phototherapy. You stand in a booth “that emits a very specific wavelength of ultraviolet light for a few minutes, twice a week,” Aivaz explains. The UV light can help ease inflammation and relieve itchy skin."

        "The most common side effect of antihistamines is drowsiness. Because of this, Sink says, it’s important to raise the dose slowly. This helps your doctor find the lowest dose you need to ease your symptoms. You can also take your antihistamine at bedtime to keep from feeling quite so sleepy during the day, Sink says. This can be especially helpful if you’re taking sedating or first-generation antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl ). Once your symptoms have been under control for several months, Sink advises slowly tapering your dose (with your doctor’s supervision, of course). In general, if you can handle the side effects of your medication, it’s best to stay on it. But if it’s seriously affecting your life or your health -- for example, if you’re so groggy that you can’t get anything done at work, or if you’re taking cyclosporine and develop high blood pressure or kidney damage -- you may need to stop taking it.
