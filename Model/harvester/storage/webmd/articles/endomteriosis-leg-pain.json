        "When you have endometriosis, tissue similar to the kind that grows in your uterus grows in places it shouldn’t. It might take root around your ovaries and fallopian tubes . It also acts like the tissue in your uterus. That means it swells during your period, then breaks down and bleeds. The problem is there’s no way for it to leave your body like the tissue in your uterus. It hurts when it swells up. That’s why you get pain with your periods and other symptoms.",
        "If endometriosis continues to spread inside your pelvis, it can pull or put pressure on nerves in your back or upper legs. It may press on the sciatic nerve . That runs from your lower back down each leg. Or it may irritate the obturator nerve in your thigh.",
        "Ovarian cysts can also lead to leg pain . Doctors call this referred pain, which can come from several areas in your belly or pelvis. The discomfort comes from certain nerves your ovaries and legs share. You’ll usually feel it in the leg that’s on the same side as the affected ovary. These cysts are the more common causes of pain related to endometriosis."
