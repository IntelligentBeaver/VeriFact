If it’s uncontrolled, it can lead to dangerous complications like kidney failure, blindness, heart attack , and stroke . But while there are over 30 different drugs on the market to help manage this disease and prevent these problems, none provide an actual cure.",
        "One reason is that until recently, we didn’t quite understand the full scope of the problem. Two decades ago, if you asked a diabetes specialist to explain the cause of type 2 diabetes , they would say insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that helps the glucose in your blood enter cells in your muscle, fat, and liver, where it’s used for energy. But when you have insulin resistance, these muscle, fat, and liver cells don’t respond well to it. As a result, your pancreas has to make more and more insulin to compensate. Over time, this can lead to type 2 diabetes."

        "Now, we know that part of the problem also lies with your beta cells. These are the cells in your pancreas that actually produce the insulin. Our bodies make most of our beta cells within the first few years of our life. But some people make more than others. As a result, if they start to develop insulin resistance later in life, their bodies still have enough beta cells to keep up insulin production. But if they don’t, the beta cells they do have work too hard and eventually die. These are the people who end up with type 2 diabetes.",
        "Here at Mount Sinai, our goal is to find drugs that can regenerate these insulin-producing beta cells. If you do that, then it would be possible to actually cure type 2 diabetes. Back in 2015, we identified a drug that may do just that, called harmine. This drug, which occurs naturally in a number of plants around the world, blocks an enzyme in the beta cells called DYRK1A. When you do this, it causes beta cells to multiply. Our study found that harmine treatment actually tripled the number of beta cells in diabetic mice. This in turn restored their blood sugar levels to normal."
