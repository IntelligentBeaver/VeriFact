        "By Lauri Vargo, MD, assistant professor of dermatology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, as told to Susan Bernstein Vitiligo is largely a chronic disease with an unpredictable course, so treatment can be challenging for many people. Every person responds differently to different medications. First, I establish their goals and expectations for their treatment. The mainstay of treatment for vitiligo starting out includes different topical creams, light therapy, and oral steroids . But the world of dermatology is ever-evolving, so new treatments are emerging now for vitiligo. If we need to, we can turn to a toolbox of newer treatments. There is a lot of good research and evidence behind some of our older therapies for vitiligo, and most dermatologists will start with these treatments."

It’s really important to apply enough sunscreen to your skin and to reapply it also. Most people don’t apply enough sunscreen to their skin. You need to apply 1 ounce of sunscreen at a time. That’s enough to fill a shot glass. You should reapply it every 2 hours or after sweating or swimming. Ultraviolet protection factor or UPF clothing is another thing I recommend. You can find these clothes at many stores these days. This clothing provides extra protection from the sun. It’s really becoming popular with kids, too.

But with vitiligo, we are treating your skin condition just as we would any other health condition you have. If you have vitiligo symptoms, coming in for a diagnosis from your dermatologist is important. That’s because other skin conditions can mimic or look like vitiligo. There are some rarer conditions we want to rule out first. There are some allergic skin conditions that can look like vitiligo.",

        "One thing I talk about with my patients is a makeup product called Dermablend to cover up skin. You may also use self-tanning products with dihydroxyacetone. Using a self-tanner product is completely OK if you have vitiligo. You can use it to cover up skin lesions if you want a more even appearance. If you go out and get a tan, you will only tan the rest of your skin. I often recommend light therapy to people with vitiligo. This is one of my favorite treatments for this condition. It’s also called phototherapy. It’s a treatment that uses directed ultraviolet rays. Sometimes, when I recommend light therapy, my patients say, “Aren’t you a dermatologist? I thought the sun is bad for your skin!” But this type of light therapy should only be done as directed by a dermatologist."
