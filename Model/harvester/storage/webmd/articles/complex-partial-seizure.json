        "Complex partial seizures, now called focal onset impaired awareness seizures , are the most common type for adults who have epilepsy (a disorder that affects your brain cells). They’re usually harmless and only last a minute or two. But they can be strange or worrying -- both for you and anyone who’s with you. Seizures are brought on by surges of electrical energy in your brain. With a complex partial seizure, the surge happens only on one side and in a specific area. It’s called “partial” because only one part of your brain is affected.",
        "During this type of seizure , you may not be able to control your movements or talk. Afterward, you may not remember at all.",
        "Anyone can have a complex partial seizure, and doctors don’t always know why they happen. They’re often related to a type of epilepsy called temporal lobe epilepsy. They also may be more common in people who have had a stroke or head injury or who have other health problems, like an infection in their brain or a tumor."
