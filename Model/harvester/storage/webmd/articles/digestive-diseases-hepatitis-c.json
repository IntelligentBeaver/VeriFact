        "You generally get infected with the hep C virus when you come into contact with the blood — even a tiny amount — from a person who is infected. Most of the people who are infected with hep C in the U.S. probably got it from sharing needles and syringes used to inject drugs. You can be infected with hep C and not know it because you may not look or feel sick at first. Most people won't have any symptoms until about 2 weeks to 6 months after they are infected.",
