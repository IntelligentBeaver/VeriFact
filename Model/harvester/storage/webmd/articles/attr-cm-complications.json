        "Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a potentially life-threatening condition affecting the heart muscle. It can lead to serious complications that may reduce the heart’s ability to pump enough blood to meet the body’s demands. ATTR-CM may also interfere with the heart’s electrical system that keeps it beating in a regular rhythm. The kidneys and the nervous system are also vulnerable to transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy complications.",
        "With an early, accurate diagnosis and a personalized treatment plan, it may be possible to manage the condition and reduce your risk of complications. You can take steps to help reduce your risk of complications and manage problems if they happen."

ATTR-CM happens when abnormal forms of the protein (amyloid fibrils) build up in the wall of the heart muscle. In time, the left ventricle – the chamber that pumps blood to most of the body – grows stiffer, making it harder for the heart to supply enough blood to the body’s organs, muscle, and other tissue.",
