        "Prior to each of my appointments with my oncologist, I have to complete a questionnaire about new symptoms, changes to medications, and other health updates. It’s a pretty straightforward form, but there was one section that always tripped me up during active treatment – mental well-being. Even though the questions were vague, they forced me to confront feelings I wasn’t ready to face. I’d breeze through the rest of the form, but when I got to that section, I never knew how to respond.",
        "How could I possibly express the emotional trauma of undergoing fertility preservation, chemotherapy, radiation, multiple surgeries, and losing my hair and breasts at just 21? Each of these experiences left scars – both physical and emotional – that I was still trying to process. I was just going through the motions of treatment, not fully comprehending that my life was changing right before my eyes. An 8½-by-11-inch piece of paper wasn’t enough space to capture the anger, sadness, loneliness, anxiety, and countless other emotions my diagnosis stirred."

        "I know I’m not alone in this emotional roller coaster. The psychological impact of a breast cancer diagnosis was one of the most profound findings of the Project 528 survey. Globally, 80% of respondents reported experiencing significant psychological distress after their diagnosis. This staggering number underscores that the emotional toll of breast cancer transcends borders – both geographically and culturally. For many, this distress doesn’t end when treatment does; it continues to shape our realities and how we navigate life after our diagnosis.",
        "Anxiety is one of the most common mental health challenges young breast cancer survivors face, with 70% of respondents worldwide reporting clinical levels. I was no stranger to anxiety, during both active treatment and beyond. It manifested in countless ways – worrying whether my treatment was working, fearing the cancer would spread, wondering what my body would look like after a double mastectomy. Would I still feel confident in my own skin? Would my hair grow back, and if so, how long would it take? The list went on and didn’t stop once chemotherapy and radiation were over."

        "In my post-treatment life, I’ve experienced the anxiety of recurrence – an almost universal experience, with 90% of respondents reporting it as an ongoing concern, even years after treatment. After going through something so unexpected, it feels only natural to worry about it happening again. After all, I’d already been dealt an unimaginable hand at 21 – who’s to say it wouldn’t happen again? Being BRCA1 positive only heightened these fears. I constantly checked my breasts for any changes – until one day, I noticed one in a picture I took while on vacation. Suddenly, I wasn’t just fearing recurrence. It was my reality.",
        "As I grow older, I’ve also started to experience anxiety about starting a future family. It turns out I’m not alone in this either, as 75% of young women expressed worry about future childbearing. At 21, kids were the furthest thing from my mind. However, I’m grateful that I was given the option to pursue fertility preservation, as this isn’t as common of a conversation as it should be during treatment. In the U.S., 70% of applicable patients discussed fertility preservation with their providers, while that number dropped to 30%-40% in many European countries, and only 20%-30% in developing countries."

        "As I was going through the fertility preservation process, I didn’t take it all that seriously. At the time, it was just another box to tick off in my treatment plan, a way to provide a sense of security for my future. Now, at 27, knowing that I do hope to have a family of my own, I’m glad I made that decision. The possibility of preserving my fertility has become much more meaningful, and I realize just how vital that conversation is for young breast cancer patients who might not be informed of the long-term implications of their treatment.",
        "Breast cancer can often feel like an isolating experience, but as the Project 528 data shows, we are not alone in our feelings. Much of the anxiety we feel around recurrence, fertility, and overall well-being are shared experiences among survivors. Too often, these conversations are overlooked, placing a greater emphasis on physical health than mental well-being. I believe the emotional scars we carry deserve just as much attention – even if we’re not ready to face them yet."
