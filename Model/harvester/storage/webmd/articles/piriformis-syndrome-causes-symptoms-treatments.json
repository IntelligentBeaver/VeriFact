        "Piriformis syndrome is a rare disorder of the nerves and muscles. When you have it, your piriformis muscle-- a flat, band-like muscle located in your butt near the top of your hip joint--presses on the sciatic nerve.",
        "Your piriformis muscle is important for lower body movement. It stabilizes your hip joint and lifts and rotates your thigh away from the body. This is how you're able to walk, shift your weight from one foot to another, and maintain balance. You also use it in sports that involve lifting and rotating your thighs. In short, you need it to perform in almost every motion of your hips and legs.",
        "The sciatic nerve is a thick and long nerve in the body. It passes alongside or goes through the piriformis muscle, goes down the back of the leg, and eventually branches off into smaller nerves that end in the feet.",

        "Sciatica is the term doctors use to describe pain, weakness, numbness, and tingling where the sciatic nerve travels through the leg. It's a symptom, not a condition on its own. Sciatica is the most common symptom of piriformis syndrome."
