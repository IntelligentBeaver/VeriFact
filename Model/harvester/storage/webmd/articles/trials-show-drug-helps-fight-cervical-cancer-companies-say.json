Vergote, MD, co-founder of European Network of Gynaecological Oncological Trial groups (ENGOT) and lead investigator in the clinical trial. “The positive data, seen in a representative patient population of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, demonstrate the potential for TIVDAK to reshape clinical practice and provide hope for patients who need a new treatment option.”",
        "TIVDAK (tisotumab vedotin)showed a 33% decrease in the risk of worsening disease or death, Fox News reported . And the intravenous drug showed an improved objective response rate of 17.8% compared to chemotherapy at 5.2%.",
        "“The trial also measured the disease control rate, which is the percentage of patients who experience complete response, partial response or stable disease,” Fox News wrote. “TIVDAK displayed a 75.9% disease control rate, while chemo showed a 58.2% rate.”"
