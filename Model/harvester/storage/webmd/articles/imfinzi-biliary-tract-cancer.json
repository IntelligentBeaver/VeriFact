Now, a newer option is available: an immunotherapy medicine called Imfinzi (durvalumab) . Immunotherapy medicines work by helping your immune system find and attack cancer cells.",

Gallbladder cancer is usually found after it has spread. Bile ducts are tubes that carry bile, a fluid made by the liver that helps digest food. Bile duct cancer is also known as cholangiocarcinoma.",

        "Imfinzi is a type of immunotherapy known as a checkpoint inhibitor. It helps your immune system fight cancer by blocking a checkpoint protein called PD-L1. Normally, checkpoint proteins on cells let your immune system know which cells to ignore and which cells to attack. Some types of cancer cells make large amounts of PD-L1 to try to hide from your immune cells (T-cells), preventing them from attacking the cancer.",
        "When Imfinzi blocks PD-L1, it stops this \"hiding\" process, which allows your T cells to find and attack the cancer cells. This boosts your body's natural immune response to cancer. By blocking PD-L1, Imfinzi can increase T cell activity, help shrink tumors, and slow down cancer growth. This may help some people live longer without their cancer getting worse."
