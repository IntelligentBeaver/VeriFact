        "Hemophilia A is a rare, inherited condition that prevents your blood from clotting the way it should. People with hemophilia A do not make enough of a protein called factor VIII, which normally works to stop bleeding when you get a cut or injury. With hemophilia A, even getting a minor injury can cause your body to bleed longer than normal.",
        "Esperoct (antihemophilic factor, recombinant) is a medicine for hemophilia A that reduces the number of times you get bleeding episodes. It is given by injection into a vein to temporarily replace the missing factor VIII in your blood so it can clot properly.",
        "Some other factor VIII medicines require infusions every other day. Esperoct is designed to last longer in your body, so you can use it less often. Most adults and teens use it about every four days, and children usually receive it twice a week. Your health care provider will tailor the schedule based on your individual needs."

On average, people in the study had about one treated bleed per year. When bleeding did occur, it was usually controlled with one or two Esperoct infusions.
