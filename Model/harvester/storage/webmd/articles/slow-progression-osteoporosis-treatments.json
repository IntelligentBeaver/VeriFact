        "To slow the progression of osteoporosis, your doctor may prescribe different medications, which, combined with calcium and vitamin D supplements, will help keep your bones stronger and slow their wear and tear. Osteoporosis happens when your bones lose density and strength. You may have heard your doctor refer to it as “resorption,” the natural process by which cells called osteoclasts break down and reabsorb old bone. Osteoporosis and resorption are closely related. Resorption happens faster than the formation of new bone by osteoblasts, which are cells that build new bone. This leads to bone loss and weak bones with gaps or pores. “With age, your bones become porous — hence the term “porosis” — making them more fragile and prone to fracture,” says Elaine Yu, MD, director of the Bone Density Center at Massachusetts General Hospital."

        "There are two main types of medications that slow the progression of osteoporosis: bisphosphonates and anabolic medications. Bisphosphonates Bisphosphonates are also called antiresorptives (anti-bone resorption drugs). If you already have low bone density or have had fractures from minor injuries, your doctor may recommend bisphosphonates. Some of the most commonly prescribed bisphosphonates for treating osteoporosis include: Alendronate (Binosto, Fosamax): One pill daily or weekly Risedronate (Actonel, Atelvia): One pill daily, weekly, or monthly Ibandronate: A monthly pill or an intravenous (IV) infusion every three months Zoledronic acid (Reclast): One annual IV infusion Anabolic medications Unlike bisphosphonates, which slow bone loss (resorption), anabolic medications help form new bone and are used in cases of advanced osteoporosis. Some of them include: Abaloparatide (Tymlos). A synthetic form of a natural hormone in the body (parathyroid hormone). You give yourself a daily injection in your abdomen. It helps create new bone and increases its density and strength. It isn’t typically used for more than two years."
