In the report, the SG calls for updating the health warning label on alcoholic drinks to include information about cancer.",

Though recommendations for moderate drinking exist, it’s important to understand that the risk of colon cancer may start at much lower levels.",

        "The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) defines moderate alcohol intake as one “standard” drink or less per day for women and two drinks or less daily for men. However, the drinks you get at bars and restaurants, or pour at home, aren’t always a standard drink."

For some cancers, like colorectal cancer and liver cancer, risk is especially elevated with alcohol consumption beyond what’s classified as moderate. Researchers have not been able to find a level of alcohol consumption that could be labeled as “safe” with no increase in cancer risk. But the risk is not all-or-nothing, and each step in decreasing alcohol consumption is associated with some decrease in cancer risk."
