        "Stress is a normal experience your body is made to handle. When you face something stressful, your brain sets off an alarm to help your body protect you from what it sees as a threat. It tells your body to release adrenaline, which boosts your heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing. This is called a “fight or flight” response. When your body senses that the threat is gone, it goes back to normal. But if you have chronic stress, or stress that doesn’t go away for days or weeks, it may lead to health problems. When your heart goes into high gear over and over for a long period, it increases your risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke."
