        "Lice are tiny parasites that live on human beings and feed on blood . They seldom cause serious medical problems, but they are both annoying and contagious. There are three types of lice that can live on people.",
        "Head lice ( Pediculus humanus capitis ) are about the size of a sesame seed or 2.1 to 3.3 millimeters long when adults. Their eggs, called nits, are barely visible whitish or yellow ovals that attach to hair shafts. Having head lice isn't related to the degree of personal hygiene. Head lice are contagious, especially among schoolchildren. They afflict an estimated 6 million to 12 million children in the United States each year. More girls get head lice -- likely because girls have more physical contact with one another and share more personal articles (such as hats, clothing, combs) that can transmit head lice. Head lice are rare among African-Americans, possibly because the shafts of their hair have a shape that lice cannot grasp easily."

Eggs can barely be seen; these tiny white particles attach so firmly to hair shafts that they are not removed by normal washing. Sometimes pubic lice may be found in other areas of the body containing coarse hair, such as armpits or the chest.",

If the lice are not treated, the person can develop complications such as skin sores or bacterial infection of the affected area. Body lice can also spread blood infections.",
