        "The best way to avoid a tick infestation in your house is to keep them out in the first place. Some ways to do that: Wear tick-repellent clothes when you venture outside. You can turn your favorite T-shirt, shorts, or hiking socks into tick-repellent clothing. They can be professionally treated with an EPA-approved, invisible, odorless repellent known as permethrin . Best part is you only have to treat your clothes once a season. The repellent stays effective through 70 washes. You can also add repellent to your gear if you’re going camping, hiking, or fishing. Use preventive products on your pets, such as a topical, chew, or collar. Wear long sleeves and long pants when you know you might come in contact with ticks. Wearing light-colored clothing is a good idea, too. That will make it easier to spot ticks if they’re crawling on you. Check yourself, family members, and pets for ticks when you are back inside. If you do spot a tick, carefully remove it with tweezers and disinfect the bite area. Remove leaves, brush, and debris in your yard. Mow your lawn frequently (ticks love to hide in tall grass). Build a fence around your yard to keep deer or stray animals – that may have ticks – out. Remove food, including spilled bird seed, or plants that attract deer or other wildlife."
