        "Although many people struggle with drowsiness and getting enough sleep at some point in their lives, some people have sleep disorders that cause chronic (long-term) issues with sleep. These sleep disorders can cause people to feel very tired and even fall asleep during the day, so they are often referred to as conditions that cause excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS).",
        "One of these disorders, narcolepsy , causes extreme sleepiness during the day, which makes it hard to focus and stay awake. As a result, many people with narcolepsy fall asleep without warning, even if they are in the middle of an activity. Many people with narcolepsy also experience something called cataplexy . During a cataplexy attack, a person suddenly loses muscle control. This can cause all types of issues, depending on which muscles are affected, from drooping eyelids to a hard time speaking to not being able to move at all. These attacks are most often caused by strong emotions and typically last for about one to two minutes."

        "Some people who work unusual hours, such as a night shift, may develop shift work sleep disorder (SWSD). People with this condition often have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. They also often feel very tired when they are at work overnight or in the early morning hours. Many people who switch to an unusual work schedule will experience sleep issues for a few weeks as their bodies begin to adjust. But people with SWSD still have trouble falling asleep and staying awake after three or more months.",

        "Getting more sleep at night does not always help with the symptoms of these conditions, so treatment may include different types of medicines. Nuvigil contains a medicine called armodafinil, which helps to reduce sleepiness by stimulating the brain. It is not entirely clear exactly how Nuvigil works as a stimulant. It seems to copy the activity of brain chemicals that act like adrenaline and increase the activity of another brain chemical called dopamine."
