        "In every issue of WebMD the Magazine , we ask our experts to answer readers' questions about a wide range of topics. In our November-December 2011 issue, we asked WebMD's baby expert, Sarah DuMond, MD, about crying and colic in babies.",
        "Q: My 2-month-old baby cries a lot. Could he have colic?",
        "A: Babies cry and they often cry a lot. It's the only way they can communicate their hunger , fatigue , pain, fear, or sense of being overwhelmed. So crying itself is very normal.",
        "Colic, on the other hand, is unexplained, excessive crying in a healthy baby. For most babies with colic, the crying starts around 3 weeks of age and goes on for several hours a day, usually at the same time (often the late afternoon or early evening), at least several times a week. The crying seems to have no cause. The babies are fed, rested, and have a clean diaper, although they sometimes draw their legs up, which can make it look like they're in pain."

Swaddling, rocking, singing, going for a car ride, and creating \"white noise\" in the background are all techniques that can help calm a colicky baby. But because constant crying can be a sign of an underlying medical problem, check with your doctor to rule out reflux, a hernia , or some other problem."
