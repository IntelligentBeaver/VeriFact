You may see physical changes from low levels in certain nutrients, he says. “Iron and B12 deficiency can cause anemia that presents as paleness and irritability,” he says. “Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets that presents as bone abnormalities like bowing of legs, frontal bossing, and poor growth; and calcium deficiency can cause issues with bone health called osteomalacia, potentially causing bone pain and increasing the chance of fractures.” Without enough zinc , your baby’s body will have a harder time healing wounds. Low vitamin A levels can cause cloudy corneas."

        "It’s extremely rare for a baby to be allergic to or be unable to drink their mother’s milk. If your baby has a reaction from breastfeeding, it’s most likely due to small proteins that have passed into the breast milk from the mother’s diet. Eliminating the food or food group from the mom’s diet can often take care of the problem and your baby can continue to breastfeed. Of course, breastfeeding isn’t possible for every mom and baby pair. For babies with a milk allergy or digestion issue, this means using special hypoallergenic formulas with the milk proteins already broken down so the baby’s system doesn’t recognize them as an allergen and can digest them easier. These formulas are either extensively hydrolyzed or elemental, which is the gentlest form of formula with proteins broken all the way into amino acids . Hypoallergenic formulas meet all the American Academy of Pediatrics requirements for nutrients for infants. Your baby should be getting all the nutrition for proper growth and development if they’re on them. “Extensively hydrolyzed formulas and elemental formulas offer comparable nutrient profiles, and most are supplemented with micronutrients including choline, an important micronutrient also found in breast milk, and others,” says Pistiner."
