This test checks for traces of opioids in your urine, blood, or saliva .",
        "Opioids are powerful drugs designed to ease pain. Your doctor might prescribe this type of medicine for serious pain, illness, or injuries. Besides pain relief, opioids can also make you feel relaxed, happy, or high till the dose wears off.",

Some 8%-12% of people prescribed opioids for chronic pain go on to develop opioid use disorder. And every year, tens of thousands die from overdoses of opioids -- so many that health experts call this a health crisis. Testing can help detect, prevent, and treat addiction."

          "text": "Anyone who takes prescription opioids is at risk for opioid use disorder (OUD). But the length of your treatment and your history with drug use can also play roles. The risk for OUD is high because opioids trigger feel-good signals in the brain ( endorphins ) that dull pain. If you take them for a long time, your body’s endorphin production dips, and you build tolerance to the drug. So you’ll need a higher dose for a similar effect.",
