While lifting weights on my own bored me to tears, working out in a supportive environment, where we challenged one another not to quit, made a huge difference. What was the reward? A cup of coffee with friends afterward, where we compared aches and pains but vowed to meet up for the next killer class.",

But here was the challenge: I could only watch Atlanta , Beverly Hills , and Dubai when my butt was planted on the recumbent seat. Strangely, I began to crave that ride, since I knew that time was reserved for the catfights and designer clothes.",

Placing a few bets on who might be most consistent for that week can be motivating, as can deciding that if everyone makes the weekly goal, there will be a group reward. (For example, something like an outing or a small family purchase; just don’t make it ice cream sundaes unless they fit into your plan!)",

The goal isn’t to kill yourself but to “play up” to him or her. By challenging yourself, you might be able to move out of a longtime comfort zone or a dreaded weight plateau.",
