        "If you're asking yourself why you pee so much, you could have a condition called polyuria. That's the medical term for making a larger amount of pee than usual.",
        "Adults usually make no more than 3 liters of urine per day. But with polyuria, you could make up to 15 liters per day. So you pee more often and in bigger amounts than usual. It's a classic sign of diabetes , but it also can come from other medical conditions or drinking too much water and other fluids.",
        "Other problems, such as an overactive bladder, an enlarged prostate, and urinary tract infections, can send you running for the bathroom many times a day, even if there isn’t much urine in your bladder. But polyuria makes you have to go more often because your bladder is full.",

Your body needs this hormone to move fluid filtered by the kidneys back into the bloodstream.
