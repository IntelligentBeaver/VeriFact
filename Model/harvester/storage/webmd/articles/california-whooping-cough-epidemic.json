            "The cyclical nature of pertussis. Pertussis typically reappears every three to five years. “The main thing is the cycle,” Cherry says. The last cyclical peak in California, Harriman says, was in 2005. Fueling the fire, the disease is also highly contagious, Harriman says.",
            "Unprotected adults. ''Immunity to pertussis wanes with increasing time since vaccination, so adolescents and adults need to boost their immunity,\" says Thomas Clark, MD, MPH, medical officer and epidemiology team leader of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.",
            "Difficulty in diagnosing. Because the first symptoms may be mild, whooping cough is not always easy to diagnose, says Brian Johnston, MD, director of the emergency department at White Memorial Medical Center in Los Angeles, where some children have been hospitalized with pertussis, a rare occurrence there. The organism, Bordetella pertussis , can be ''hard to culture,\" he says. \"It is extremely difficult, the diagnosis. You have to be clinically suspecting it all the time,\" and be prepared to prescribe antibiotics -- the treatment for whooping cough -- even though doctors have been schooled in general not to over-prescribe them.",
            "Mutations in the bacteria. Pertussis bacteria may be mutating and outwitting the vaccine, according to a Dutch researcher who published his findings in 2009 in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases."
