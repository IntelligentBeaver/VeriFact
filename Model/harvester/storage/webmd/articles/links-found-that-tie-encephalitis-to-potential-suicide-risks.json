        "During that period, Bravo, who today is a law student based in New York, tried to take her life twice.",

        "She panicked and couldn't find her way to the subway. She doesn’t remember how she got home. But when she did, she collapsed, screaming that she was dying. She was rushed to the hospital, where she was admitted to the psychiatric unit."
