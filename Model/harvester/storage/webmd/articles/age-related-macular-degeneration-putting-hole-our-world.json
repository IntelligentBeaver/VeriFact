As light hits our eyes, the retina’s macula recasts our world in a bloom of color with astoundingly high visual sharpness.",

        "“If you don’t treat wet AMD quickly, it’s game over,” warned Gonzalez. “Wet macular degeneration is the quicker process of vision loss because these blood vessels wreak havoc.” These new blood vessels bleed, causing fluid to build in the macula, which ultimately leads to scarring.",
