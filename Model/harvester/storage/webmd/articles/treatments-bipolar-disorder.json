        "We all have good moods and bad moods. But if you have bipolar disorder , the highs and lows feel more intense and last longer. Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that involves periods of intense emotion called mood episodes. These episodes can last for days or weeks and interfere with your normal life. During a manic episode, you might feel extremely happy or energized and need much less sleep. During a depressive episode, you could feel deeply sad or irritable and may not be able to experience pleasure.",
        "If you are diagnosed with bipolar disorder, there are many medicines available that can help stabilize your mood. Managing your condition should be a team effort between you and your doctor. They can help find the best treatments for your symptoms and personality. After you start taking medicine, it's important to share any changes in your symptoms with your doctor. If your medicine causes unwanted side effects or isn't helping with your symptoms, your doctor can adjust your dose or recommend other options."

        "After remission from an acute episode of bipolar disorder, there's an especially high risk of relapse. Ongoing therapy often is recommended. Generally, anyone who has had two or more manic episodes (or less severe hypomanic episodes) is considered to have lifetime bipolar disorder. Maintenance therapy minimizes the risk of future episodes. Once your doctor has helped stabilize the moods of the acute phase of the disorder (either a manic or depressive episode), medication therapy is usually continued indefinitely — sometimes at lower doses.",

You could also struggle to manage either extreme highs or extreme lows. Your health care provider may prescribe medicine to help keep your moods from swinging from high to low and back again. There are two categories of mood-stabilizing drugs, known as lithium and anticonvulsants , and different brand name versions of each.

        "If you are diagnosed with bipolar disorder, there are many medicines available that can help stabilize your mood. Some medicines prevent or treat manic episodes, others prevent or treat depressive episodes, and others help manage both. The main types of medicines for bipolar disorder include mood-stabilizing drugs and antipsychotic drugs, sometimes along with antidepressant medications. Most people take more than one drug, such as a mood-stabilizing drug and an antipsychotic or antidepressant. But it's important that treatment be ongoing — even after you feel better — to keep mood symptoms under control. Even if you have been without bipolar symptoms for many months, do not stop taking your medications. Your doctor may lower your doses, but discontinuation of medications will put you at risk for recurrence of bipolar symptoms . Before stopping any medications, discuss it with your doctor. Therapy is also an important part of managing bipolar disorder. Managing your condition should be a team effort between you and your doctor."

Some medicines prevent or treat manic episodes, others prevent or treat depressive episodes, and others help manage both. The main types of medicines for bipolar disorder include mood-stabilizing drugs and antipsychotic drugs, sometimes along with antidepressant medications. Most people take more than one drug, such as a mood-stabilizing drug and an antipsychotic or antidepressant. But it's important that treatment be ongoing — even after you feel better — to keep mood symptoms under control. Even if you have been without bipolar symptoms for many months, do not stop taking your medications. Your doctor may lower your doses, but discontinuation of medications will put you at risk for recurrence of bipolar symptoms . Before stopping any medications, discuss it with your doctor.

In rare cases, it can also cause mania. TMS is a noninvasive procedure, so you won't need anesthesia. It can be done daily for four to six weeks (also called repetitive TMS).",
