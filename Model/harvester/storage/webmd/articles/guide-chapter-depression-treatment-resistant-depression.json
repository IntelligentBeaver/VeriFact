  "meta_description": "Some forms of depression are harder to treat than others. If you've been undergoing treatment for depression and nothing seems to be working, you may have treatment-resistant depression (TRD), or refractory depression. With the right plan, treatment-resistant depression can be controlled; it's just a matter of finding the right combination of medication, therapy, and complementary therapies.",
