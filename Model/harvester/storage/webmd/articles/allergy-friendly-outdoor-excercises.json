Nasal steroid sprays should be started 24 hours before a planned exposure.",

        "Avoid exercising outdoors if you are run down, tired, jet lagged, or stressed, since your immune system is likely to react more swiftly and severely to an allergen. Women with seasonal allergies should avoid exercising outdoors during their menstrual cycle, since the body may be slightly more sensitive to allergens during this time.",
        "If you are beginning a fitness program , and allergies are moderate to severe, exercise indoors for several weeks to help condition your body, before moving activities outdoors.",
        "Be aware of oral allergy syndrome -- a cross reaction between what you eat and the pollen count outside. If you are allergic to birch trees for example, eating apples, cherries, peaches, plums or celery seed, before or after working out, might intensify allergy symptoms. Other possible cross-reactions include chamomile tea, melon, banana, cucumber, and sunflower seeds, which interact with ragweed and other weed pollens.",
