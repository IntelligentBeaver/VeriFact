        "Misokinesia is a psychological problem that causes people to be bothered by the sight of someone else who is fidgeting or making other repeated body movements. (The word \"misokinesia\" is Greek for \"hatred of movement.\") This recently discovered phenomenon can leave you feeling distracted, frustrated , angry, and even capable of violence because someone else in the room can’t seem to sit still.",
        "For example, if you have misokinesia, you may keep losing your place while reading a book if someone across the room is mindlessly bobbing their foot up and down or drumming their fingers on a table. \"Or if you’re watching a movie and somebody starts fidgeting, you cannot follow along with the plot,\" says cognitive psychologist Sumeet Jaswal, PhD, an instructor at Langara College, in Vancouver, British Columbia. \"Something as simple as fidgeting with a pen can draw somebody’s attention and really bother them.\"",

        "Jaswal is one of the world’s leading authorities on misokinesia, which she began studying while pursuing her doctoral degree at the University of British Columbia. Jaswal has interviewed many people with misokinesia and says that the condition can harm relationships with family members, friends, and romantic partners. \"Essentially, it’s the people who you’re around most of the time who will trigger you,\" she says.",
        "Misokinesia can be serious enough to split up couples, Jaswal says. Some college students told Jaswal that they get distracted if a classroom instructor waves her or his hands around a lot. \"They could not pay attention to anything important that the professor was telling them,\" she says. Some people with misokinesia may avoid social situations where they worry their symptoms may be triggered."
