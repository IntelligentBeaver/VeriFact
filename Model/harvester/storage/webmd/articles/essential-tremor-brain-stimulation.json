        "To treat essential tremor with deep brain stimulation, electrodes are placed in the thalamus during surgery. The electrodes are connected by wires to a type of pacemaker device (called an impulse generator, or IPG) implanted under the skin of the chest, below the collarbone. Once activated, the device sends continuous (painless) electrical pulses to the thalamus, blocking the impulses that cause tremors. This has the same effect as thalamotomy without actually destroying parts of the brain.",
        "The IPG can easily be programmed using a computer that sends radio signals to the IPG. Patients are given special magnets so they can externally turn the IPG on or off.",
        "Depending on use, the stimulators may last three to five years. The IPG replacement procedure is relatively simple."
