        "July 18, 2023 – The FDA has approved a shot that is highly effective at protecting infants from potentially deadly illnesses caused by respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. Nearly all children have an RSV infection by their second birthday.",
        "The new preventive treatment, called Beyfortus, contains antibodies that reduce the chance of a severe infection by up to 75%. The protection can last up to 5 months, which is about the length of the typical RSV season. On Monday, the FDA approved the shot for babies up to 1 year old, and also for high-risk toddlers up to 2 years old.",
        "“RSV can cause serious disease in infants and some children and results in a large number of emergency department and physician office visits each year,” FDA Office of Infectious Diseases Director John Farley, MD, MPH, said in a statement . “Today’s approval addresses the great need for products to help reduce the impact of RSV disease on children, families and the health care system.”"
