        "Tinnitus -- or a ringing, buzzing, or whistling in your ears -- is a common and often frustrating experience. Sometimes it goes away on its own or with the help of a doctor, but other times it is a long-term condition. This noise can be more than distressing. It can cause health problems like anxiety, depression , sleep disturbance, and hearing loss. It also can lead to hyperacusis , or high sensitivity to sounds.",
        "Many things can cause tinnitus , so your doctor will try to identify the root of the problem. To do this, they might ask you to take a hearing exam, have an imaging scan like a CT or MRI , or do bloodwork. Because earwax buildup can cause tinnitus, your doctor might try cleaning your ears. They also might treat conditions that can cause tinnitus, like hypertension and TMJ disorders, or adjust any medications you are taking that can cause tinnitus as a side effect. If that doesn’t work, they might prescribe treatment to help relieve tinnitus symptoms and improve your well-being.",
        "Thanks to technological advances, we have more convenient, cost-effective, and unnoticeable options for treating tinnitus than ever before. These technologies tend to work best when used with tinnitus education and counseling . Here are some of the latest and most promising therapies."
