        "Lumbar lordosis is when the back has an excessive curve, which may be situated just above the buttocks. This is often accompanied by lower back pain. A number of factors — from posture to pregnancy — can make the pain and discomfort associated with this problem worse.",
        "Lumbar lordosis often develops after an infection of the spine's vertebrae . Commonly referred to as discitis, this condition can be viral but usually involves a bacterial infection. Although it’s common in children, the condition can also develop in pregnancy because of natural shifts in the expecting mother's center of gravity that can make it tough to maintain good posture during pregnancy . Poor posture in both childhood and adulthood can also contribute to the problem.",
        "Gentle exercises are a top option for many conditions that involve undesirable curvature of the spine . Stretching and breathing exercises, in particular, can reduce pain while also strengthening your muscles to help your posture, which can keep the condition from worsening.",
        "As with any type of exercise, it is important to start gradually and build up in intensity over time. This will help prevent you from unintentionally making the problem worse with overly intense exercises."
