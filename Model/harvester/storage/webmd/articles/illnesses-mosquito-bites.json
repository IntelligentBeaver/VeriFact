        "Mosquitoes are small, flying insects that are common to the U.S. They have a long, needle-like mouth part called a proboscis that breaks skin and sucks blood from people and animals.",
        "Some mosquitoes are considered to be vectors, or insects that spread germs to people and animals that can cause illnesses. A mosquito can become infected with a disease after taking blood from an infected person or animal, and just a few mosquitoes can carry an illness throughout a community.",
        "They live in many places, such as forests, marshes, and tall grass areas, but can live indoors, too. They are attracted to standing water because that’s where they lay their eggs. Young mosquitoes live in water until they become adults.",
        "Adult mosquitoes can live for about 2 to 4 weeks depending on their type and environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity. Most mosquitoes hibernate or die when the temperature drops below 50 degrees.",
