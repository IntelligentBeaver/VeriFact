        "Unlike calcium, which you only get through food, your body makes vitamin D when sunlight touches your skin. Active people who live in sunny regions can get at least some of the vitamin D they need from spending time outdoors every day. But in less temperate areas like Minnesota, Michigan, and New York, the skin makes less vitamin D in the winter months, especially if you're older.",
        "The amount of vitamin D your skin makes depends on where you live, how light or dark your skin is, and the time of day you’re outside. It could be about 15 minutes for a very fair-skinned person and an hour or two for someone with darker skin. But be careful – too much time in the sun raises your chance of getting skin cancer . Even though sunlight is a key part of your body’s vitamin D production, it’s best to protect your skin with clothing and sunscreen if you’ll be outside for more than a few minutes."
