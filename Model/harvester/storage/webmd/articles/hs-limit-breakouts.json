        "These measures can not only help ward off flares before they start, but also care for the skin that's already dealing with lumps and sores. Address your sweat. HS lumps are most common in areas where skin rubs together – which is also where sweat tends to gather, clog pores, and make symptoms worse. As best you can, avoid activities that make you overheat. Opt for indoor workouts such as swimming, and keep your house cool. If you're still struggling with sweat after taking these steps, ask your doctor about prescription medications that can help reduce sweat. Stay cool. The cooler you can stay throughout the day, the less likely you are to sweat and flare. One way to do this is to wear loose layers. Loose clothing is important so that you avoid the friction of tight waistbands and fabrics on your skin. Wearing tight clothing can also help trigger HS symptoms and make them more severe. Breathable clothing made of natural fiber like cotton is best for letting air in and heat out. Keep clean. Regular bathing with antibacterial soap helps prevent some clogs and reduce the risk of infection. Avoid scrubbing your skin when you wash, which can irritate your skin. Keep your products fragrance-free, too. The scents in some soaps and deodorants can also irritate skin with HS."

Another way to reduce inflammation? Keep your blood sugar levels in check. Doctors aren't sure exactly how, but HS and diabetes seem to be related. Eat plenty of fiber-rich foods (fruits, vegetables), and pair those with foods high in proteins (fish, eggs). Spread small meals throughout your day to keep a steady glucose level in your blood instead of spiking it with fewer bigger meals."
