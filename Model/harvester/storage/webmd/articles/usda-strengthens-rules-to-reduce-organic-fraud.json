        "Jan. 20, 2023 -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture has amended its rules to increase oversight and enforcement of the production and sale of organic products in an effort to reduce “organic fraud.”",
        "Organic fraud is the representation, labeling, and sale of nonorganic agricultural products as organic, the Federal Register said . It can happen because of high demand for organic products and lack of direct enforcement of USDA rules.",
        "“These amendments close gaps in the current regulations to build consistent certification practices to deter and detect organic fraud, and improve transparency and product traceability,” said an executive summary of the amended rules in the Federal Register. “In addition, the amendments will assure consumers that organic products meet a robust, consistent standard and reinforce the value of the organic label.”",
        "The Strengthening Organic Enforcement Rule will require certification of more business such as brokers and traders, require organic identification on nonretail containers, allow more rigorous on-site inspection of certified organic operations, and establish more uniform training standards for organic inspectors, a USDA news release said ."
