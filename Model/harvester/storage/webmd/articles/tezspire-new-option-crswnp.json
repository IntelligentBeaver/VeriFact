        "Tezspire (tezepelumab-ekko) is a prescription medicine used to treat inflammatory conditions of the airways, such as severe asthma. The FDA has now approved it as an add-on treatment for adults and children aged 12 and older with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) that is not well controlled with current treatments. Tezspire is a lab-made antibody that blocks certain parts of your immune system that cause inflammation.",
        "CRSwNP causes swelling in the sinuses and leads to growths called polyps in the nose. These can block airflow, reduce your sense of smell, and make you feel congested. It’s estimated that up to 320 million people around the world live with this condition.",
        "Tezspire works by blocking a protein called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which plays a key role in causing inflammation in the airways and sinuses. This inflammation can make breathing difficult and worsen symptoms of CRSwNP and asthma. First approved in 2021 as an add-on treatment for severe asthma, Tezspire offers a new option for people living with this chronic condition."

Those who got this medicine had more improvement in both polyp size and congestion than those who got the placebo.
