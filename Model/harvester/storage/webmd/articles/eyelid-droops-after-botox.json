        "Getting Botox and similar medications (Dysport, Jeuveau, and Xeomin) is one of the most popular cosmetic procedures that you can have without surgery. They’re “neurotoxins,” medications that relax certain muscles in order to lessen wrinkles in those areas.",
        "These medications are generally safe when injected by a doctor or trained professional, but there can be side effects. The most common negative reaction to injections to your face is a droopy eyelid, also called ptosis or blepharoptosis. Most people don’t have this problem. Around 5% of people who get Botox will have problems with eyelid droop. This number falls to less than 1% if a skilled doctor does the injection. You should get neurotoxin shots only in a medical setting."
