        "This fall, USA Network will air the 100th episode of the hit detective series, Monk. “It should be a lot of fun,” says actor Tony Shalhoub, 54, who has played the title character for seven seasons. “Especially because Monk really likes the number 100.”",
        "Adrian Monk, for those not in the know, is a warm and brokenhearted detective who has obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ), a mental illness with specific traits that Shalhoub says are not all that hard for him to identify with. Brilliant crime fighter that Monk is, he struggles with distraction, focusing at times on the inconsequential, such as dandruff on someone’s shoulder or the arrangement of doughnuts in a box. He must touch every parking meter he passes and wipe his hands after every handshake."

That’s why Shalhoub and Monk co-creator David Hoberman recently teamed with the Anxiety Disorders Association of America to launch an OCD awareness campaign called “Treat It, Don’t Repeat It: Break Free From OCD.” The national campaign uses public service announcements and educational videos and materials aimed at health care professionals, people with OCD, and their families to educate, provide support, and encourage treatment. Many of those with the condition suffer in isolation, but with therapy and medication people can manage their symptoms and live full, productive lives."

But people who suffer with the disorder don’t have to be outcasts. They can be and are contributing members of society.”"
