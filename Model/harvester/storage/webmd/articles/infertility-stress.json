        "Urit Chaimovitz was sitting in a Boston infertility clinic when a poster for a mindfulness-based program to help women conceive caught her eye.",
        "At the time, Chaimovitz had been trying to have a baby for 2 years without success. She had managed to get pregnant four times before, both naturally and with IVF. But each time, she lost the baby around the second trimester.",
        "“It’s so stressful when you don’t know why you’re having trouble,” says Chaimovitz, now 42. “I wanted a baby so badly I would have hung upside down or drunk gallons of green juice if I thought it helped.”",
        "So Chaimovitz eagerly signed up for the mindfulness program led by Alice Domar, PhD, executive director of the Domar Center for Mind/Body Health. The 10-week sessions included yoga, meditation, and learning behavioral techniques like overcoming negative thoughts. Several months after finishing the program, Chaimovitz got pregnant again. Her daughter, Romi, was born in 2018.",
        "“When you’re trying to get pregnant and someone tells you to just relax, you get annoyed,” Chaimovitz says. “But in my case, I really do think it helped. I stopped feeling like my body was the enemy.”",
        "It’s not easy to tease out all the reasons why some couples seem to conceive easily and quickly while others have much more trouble. But research suggests that stress may be one factor that can affect the conception math."
