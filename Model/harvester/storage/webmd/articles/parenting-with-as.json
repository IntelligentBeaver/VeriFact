        "My children were in public school, and my daughter, who’s the eldest, was heading off for an exciting sixth grade graduation trip. She was so excited and looking forward to being with her classmates. I was happy for her, but it was hard to be feeling all the feels because I was getting ready for total hip replacement surgery as a result of my ankylosing spondylitis (AS). My daughter was counting down the days to her trip, and I was counting down the days to my surgery.",
        "All I can say is the day of surgery couldn’t have come fast enough. I was in agony, depressed, and had become a former shell of myself. My days consisted of popping prescription pain pills and sitting zoned out in my chair with my brain in a hazy fog.",
        "I couldn’t do the things I wanted to do with my kids -- things I could do before the pain took my breath away. I missed taking them to the zoo to watch the lions frolicking with each other or reading them their favorite bedtime story."
