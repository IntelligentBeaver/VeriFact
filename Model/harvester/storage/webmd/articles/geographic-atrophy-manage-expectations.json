        "By Raj Maturi, MD as told to Rachel Reiff Ellis Geographic atrophy (GA) is the loss of a thin but critical layer of cells in your retina. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Even though this layer of cells is very thin, it’s critical for vision. These cells line your rod and cone photoreceptors, which are the parts of your eye that help you see in low light, see sharply in brighter light, and see color. When you have GA, these cells waste away and die."

Luckily, if you have low vision, there are rehabilitation services available. Vision rehabilitation is different from eye examination and diagnosis of problems. A rehabilitation team focuses on helping you find ways to keep doing your daily activities even with vision loss. They take stock of what vision you have, as well as what you need to do each day."

        "Although GA isn’t currently curable, the future of its treatment is hopeful. Two new medications are available for some patients with GA: avacincaptad pegol (Izervay) and pegcetacoplan (Syfovre). Both are medications a doctor injects into your eye once a month. The goal with these injections is to hopefully slow your disease. These drugs don’t improve your vision, but they can slow the progression of your GA. Ask your ophthalmologist if these treatments are right for you. A newer therapy for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) just got FDA clearance. GA is an advanced form of dry AMD. The new treatment is a light therapy that seems to slow the start of GA and preserve your central vision by about three to four letters over two years. Valeda is the company developing this therapy. Some data is still needed, as it seems to be most beneficial in a very small segment of the population – those with vision loss and minimal GA."
