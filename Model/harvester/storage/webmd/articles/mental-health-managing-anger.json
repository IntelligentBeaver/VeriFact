Anger that is not appropriately expressed can disrupt relationships, affect thinking and behavior patterns, and create a variety of physical problems. Chronic (long-term) anger has been linked to health issues such as high blood pressure, heart problems, headaches, skin disorders, and digestive problems. In addition, poorly managed anger can be linked to problems such as alcohol and substance abuse, crime, emotional and physical abuse, and other violent behavior."

        "When you start feeling angry, try deep breathing, positive self-talk, or stopping your angry thoughts. Breathe deeply from your diaphragm. Slowly repeat a calm word or phrase such as \"relax\" or \"take it easy.\" Repeat it to yourself while breathing deeply until the anger subsides.",
        "Avoid alcohol or illicit drugs that can make you more likely to act on angry feelings impulsively.",
        "Although expressing anger is better than keeping it in, anger should be expressed in an appropriate way. Frequent outbursts of anger are often counterproductive and cause problems in relationships with others. Anger outbursts are also stressful to your nervous and cardiovascular systems and can make health problems worse. Learning how to use assertiveness is the healthy way to express your feelings, needs, and preferences. Being assertive can be used in place of using anger in these situations.",
        "Seek out the support of others. Talk through your feelings and try to work on changing your behaviors.",
        "If you have trouble realizing when you are having angry thoughts, keep a log of when you feel angry and try to find the triggers.",
        "Try to gain a different perspective by putting yourself in another's place.",
        "Learn how to laugh at yourself and see humor in situations.",
        "Practice good listening skills. Listening can help improve communication and can facilitate trusting feelings between people. This trust can help you deal with potentially hostile emotions.",
        "Learn to assert yourself, expressing your feelings calmly and directly without becoming defensive, hostile, or emotionally charged. Consult self-help books on assertiveness or seek help from a professional therapist to learn how to use assertiveness and anger management skills."
