However you do it, parents with lupus need to have regular, scheduled help, Katz says. \"You must have time to yourself that you can depend on,\" says Katz, \"time when you can take a nap or take a walk and know that your kids will be OK.\"",
        "Plan for emergencies. Most people with lupus do quite well with treatment. Even so, parents with lupus should all have a disaster plan in case they ever get seriously sick or hospitalized, Katz says. Make sure close friends and family know what they would need to do. Not only will a plan help things run more smoothly if you have a health setback, it will reduce your anxiety now.",
        "Don't let your kids get overburdened. If you have lupus, your kids will probably have to help out more around the house than they would otherwise. That's to be expected. Just be careful not to put too much on your children's shoulders. \"You don't want your kids to grow up feeling like a semi-parent,\" says Katz.",
        "Consider seeing a therapist. Being able to express your concerns to a therapist — about everyday hassles as well as serious health anxieties — will help you feel better and more in control. A therapist can teach parents with lupus practical techniques to manage the day. Family therapy can be a good idea too.

        "You might feel uncomfortable talking to your kids about lupus. Lupus is unpredictable, and you may not be sure of your health in the long-term. It's tempting to avoid the subject. But that won't work for long. Even young kids will sense that something is wrong. If you don't talk about it, your kids might not ask — but they might worry in private.",

        "Explain the basics. The specifics depend on your kids' age and your health. Talk about how lupus affects you, says Lisa Fitzgerald, MD, a rheumatologist at the Lupus Center of Excellence at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. It might make you tired , achy, forgetful, and cranky. Stress that you’re getting good treatment and most people with lupus do well. Make clear that lupus is not like cancer — it doesn't get worse and worse. Instead, it's unpredictable — you'll have good days and bad days.",
        "Let them ask questions. Don't feel obligated to tell your kids everything about lupus, Katz says. Let your kids guide the conversation with their questions. If they ask about the scary stuff — like whether you might die — answer them in a reassuring way. But you're not obligated to talk about unlikely worst-case scenarios if they’re not asking, Katz says.",
        "Ask them what they know about lupus. You really can't predict what your child might have picked up about lupus, Katz says. Your son might wonder why you seem so rundown compared to apparently healthy celebrities who say they have lupus. Or he might be terrified because he assumes lupus is a death sentence — all because a friend told him his grandmother died from it 20 years ago.
