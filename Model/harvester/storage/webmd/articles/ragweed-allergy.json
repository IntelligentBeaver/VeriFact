        "What does ragweed look like?",
        "Ragweed plants have spiky flowers that are dull green or yellowish, and the stems of the plant look hairy. The leaves are thin and divided, with lobes or “teeth” somewhat like fern leaves. Many branches grow from each stem of a ragweed plant.",

        "Ragweed is part of the aster (asteraceae) family, which also includes daisies and sunflowers. Seventeen types of ragweed plants grow in North America. Among the species that are most common in the U.S. are common ragweed and giant ragweed."
