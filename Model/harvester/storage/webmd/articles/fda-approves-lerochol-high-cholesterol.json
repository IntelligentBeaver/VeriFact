        "Lerochol (lerodalcibep-liga) is a new medicine approved by the FDA to help lower elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), often called “bad cholesterol,” in adults with hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol levels), including those with a genetic form called heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). It is a self-administered monthly under-the-skin injection, meant to be used with diet and exercise to help reach and maintain the desired LDL-C goals.",
        "Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and in the U.S. Lowering LDL-C levels helps reduce health risks, leading to improved outcomes. Although cholesterol-lowering treatments like statins exist, many people with heart disease or those at risk struggle to achieve recommended cholesterol levels. About 1 in 200 people are born with the genetic condition called familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which causes very high LDL-C levels from birth, requiring lifelong care.",
        "Lerochol belongs to a group of medicines known as PCSK9 inhibitors. PCSK9 is a protein that limits how many LDL receptors your liver has, affecting the liver’s ability to remove LDL-C from the blood. By blocking PCSK9, Lerochol increases the number of LDL receptors in your liver, helping it to remove more LDL-C from your blood, leading to lower LDL-C levels.",
        "Lerochol’s design makes it a more convenient option than other PCSK9 inhibitors, which often require more frequent dosing. It’s a small recombinant fusion protein that combines parts of a human antibody (PCSK9-binding domain) with a protein called albumin; this helps it stay in your body longer, so that you only need one injection under the skin each month. Being a self-injected medicine that remains stable at room temperature for up to three months, Lerochol offers patients the flexibility to take it anytime, anywhere."
