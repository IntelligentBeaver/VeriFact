Your atopic dermatitis might be relatively mild. But for some people, it can be more severe. Your skin may be unbearably itchy. It can feel like it’s burning or as if you’re being stuck with needles. The good news is that you’ll have many ways to control your atopic dermatitis today. Your treatment options and plan will depend on whether your skin symptoms are mild or more severe.

You’re most likely to try a JAK inhibitor if other treatments, including biologics, haven’t worked. JAK inhibitors come with a black box warning for possible adverse events, including serious infections, heart events, and cancer. Oral JAK inhibitors approved for atopic dermatitis include: Abrocitinib (Cibinqo) Upadacitinib (Rinvoq) Doctors traditionally used other general immune suppressants for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. They aren’t approved specifically for eczema, and they also come with serious side effects since they don’t work in a targeted way. Sometimes they may still be used for a short time, but experts generally don’t recommend them. These medicines include: Azathioprine Cyclosporine Methotrexate Mycophenolate Oral corticosteroids. Oral steroids are another way to suppress the immune system. They’re not good to take for long periods because of their side effects. In general, doctors don’t recommend taking these medicines for atopic dermatitis today. In rare cases, you might take one for a short time if you’re having an intense flare or lack other options."
