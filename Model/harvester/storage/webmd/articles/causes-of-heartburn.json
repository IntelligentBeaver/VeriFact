        "Overeating. Overeating can trigger heartburn. That’s because the stomach remains distended when there are large quantities of food in it. There is a muscle located between your esophagus and your stomach. Your esophagus is a tube that lets food pass from your mouth to your stomach, and the muscle between it and your stomach is called the lower esophageal sphincter or LES. The more your stomach stays distended, the more likely the LES won't close properly. When it doesn’t close, it can’t prevent food and stomach juices from rising back up into the esophagus.",
        "Eating habits. Eating too rapidly can be a heartburn trigger. So can eating while lying down or eating too close to bedtime . It helps not to eat during the two or three hours before you go to bed.",

        "Hiatal hernia . Your diaphragm is a muscular wall that separates your stomach from your chest. It helps the LES keep stomach acid where it belongs. When the LES and the upper part of the stomach move above the diaphragm you develop a hiatal hernia. The hernia makes acid reflux , which causes heartburn, more likely. You may not even know you have a hiatal hernia. Often, heartburn is the only symptom.",

        "Medication. Common medications taken for other problems, including over-the-counter and prescription drugs , can increase the likelihood of heartburn. That includes medicines used to treat asthma, high blood pressure, heart problems, arthritis or other inflammation , osteoporosis (low bone density), anxiety, insomnia , depression, pain, Parkinson's disease, muscle spasm , or cancer . Also, drugs used for hormone therapy can be a heartburn trigger."
