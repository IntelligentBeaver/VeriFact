Use the vent fan in your bathroom and kitchen. Set your water heater to at least 130 degrees F. Wear a mask when you’re digging in the dirt. Wet potting soil before you use it. Stay away from misty showers or sinks. Talk to your doctor about more ways to avoid a MAC infection. If you do get sick, they’ll help you find the best treatment to get better.",
