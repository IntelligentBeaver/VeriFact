If they’re not, your doctor can recommend a mental illness specialist, like a psychologist , therapist, or social worker, who can create a plan for you. If you are considering medication, they may refer you to a psychiatrist as well.",

You'll learn new ways to respond to them in place of your repetitive rituals. ERP is a process you may do one-on-one with your mental health professional or in group therapy , either by yourself or with your family there."
