        "When there’s inflammation in your tear glands, cornea, or conjunctiva (outermost layers of your eyes), your body may not make enough tears. Or your tears won't be made of the right mixture of water, oils, and salts. These changes make your eyes dry.",
        "Over time, inflammation can lead to long-term changes to nerves in your eyes.",

        "Research has shown that over time, eye inflammation can lead not only to temporary changes in your tears, but long-term changes to nerves in your eyes. Long-term inflammation can also cause other cells in your eyes to die, leading to long-lasting eye conditions."
