        "PBC mainly impacts women and people AFAB, especially those ages 40 to 60. The disease is much more common in women than men, affecting 10 women for every one man. PBC and estrogen Researchers don’t know exactly why women and people AFAB are more likely to get PBC. One reason could be changes in estrogen levels. This can happen during a woman’s menstrual cycle or during and after menopause. Sex hormones impact how your immune cells work by binding to specific receptors. Estrogen typically boosts immune responses. It can promote the growth of certain immune cells that influence autoimmune diseases like PBC. The hormone also triggers bile duct cells to grow and release substances that can worsen liver damage in the disease."

        "The bacteria in your gut may play a crucial role in whether you get PBC. One study found that people with PBC with a high-risk gene have different gut bacteria – and less of it – than those without the gene. People with this gene also have more of a type of bacteria (called veillonella), which researchers have linked to urinary tract infections (UTIs). This suggests a link between bacterial infections and the risk of forming PBC. PBC and genes Family history matters when it comes to PBC. Research shows: Around 1% to 9% of people with PBC have family members who also have it. First-degree relatives are much more likely to have specific antibodies related to PBC. If one identical twin has PBC, the other twin has a 63% chance of also having the condition. Researchers have also found that the X chromosome, which determines your sex, is vital in understanding why more women and people AFAB have PBC. Women and people AFAB have two X chromosomes. Studies have shown that people from these groups who have PBC often have more cells that are missing one X chromosome or that have X chromosome changes. These changes can affect immune system genes and raise your chances of having PBC."

          "text": "If you’re a woman or person AFAB with PBC, you have a higher chance of bone thinning and weakness (osteoporosis). Your doctor could prescribe calcium and vitamin D for better bone density and to ward off bone loss. Walking and lifting weights can also help to boost bone density. Living with a chronic disease like PBC can take a toll on your mental health. Studies have found that about 30% to 45% of people who live with this condition have symptoms of depression, such as problems with thinking skills, low mood, and withdrawal. Half of the people surveyed on the effects of PBC said they felt highly stressed and anxious. And 60% weren’t happy with their current way of life because they had to constantly deal with their symptoms. Caring for your mental health is important as you live with PBC. Talk to your doctor about ways that you can get help to manage your feelings. They may prescribe medications for depression and anxiety and can refer you to a therapist. You may also benefit from joining a support group and connecting with others who have PBC to share experiences and resources.",
