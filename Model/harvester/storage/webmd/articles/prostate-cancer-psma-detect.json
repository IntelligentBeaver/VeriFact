        "The test can spot signs that the disease has metastasized, meaning it has spread beyond the prostate to other parts of the body. When this process begins, the cancer is often small and difficult to detect. PSMA PET scans are better than other imaging tests at spotting metastasis early. It’s used in three different scenarios:"

That could lead to a false positive — meaning the test reveals what appears to be cancer but is not — and require additional testing to confirm those results. Some types of MRI, according to recent research, miss 1 in 6 prostate cancer tumors. This is called a false negative, in which the test fails to find cancer that’s actually there.",

            "You may have an aggressive form of prostate cancer likely to spread (metastasize). One factor that indicates your cancer is aggressive is a PSA of 20 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) or higher. If that’s the case for you, your doctor likely will recommend a PSMA PET scan.",
            "You have been treated for prostate cancer, but it shows signs of coming back. If you have had a radical prostatectomy, in which your prostate and some surrounding tissue are removed, your PSA level should be very low — below 0.1 ng/mL — if not undetectable entirely. If follow-up tests show a PSA of 0.2 or higher, that likely means your cancer has returned. PSMA PET scans can detect cancer at PSA levels as low as 0.2 ng/mL, though they become more accurate at higher levels."
