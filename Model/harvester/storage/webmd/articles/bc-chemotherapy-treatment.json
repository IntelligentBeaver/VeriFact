        "Chemotherapy for breast cancer uses medicine to kill cancer cells. You'll likely get the treatment as an infusion through a vein or as a pill. In most cancer centers, a large majority of patients will get an infusion through a central port in the chest wall, instead of in their arm. Your doctor may use it along with other treatments like surgery, radiation, and hormone therapy. As a breast cancer treatment , chemotherapy has three major purposes: To prevent cancer from coming back after surgery and radiation . When chemotherapy is used this way, it's called To shrink a tumor before surgery to make it easier to remove. This is called neo-adjuvant therapy. To kill cancer cells that have spread to other parts of the body. Together, you and your doctor will decide when to start chemotherapy , which drugs to use, and a schedule for taking them. Ask what side effects you can expect from the medication ."

You'll meet with the person on your health care team who's going to give you the chemo. They'll check your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure . (They'll call these your vital signs.) They'll put the IV into your vein. They'll give you medications to prevent nausea, anxiety, and inflammation along with the chemotherapy. When your treatment is done, they'll remove your IV and check your vital signs again. You'll get prescriptions for drugs you can take at home to help with side effects.
