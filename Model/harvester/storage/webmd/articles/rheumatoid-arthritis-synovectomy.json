        "Even if you have a good result, it might not last. The synovium often grows back a few years after surgery. Synovitis is more likely to come back after an arthroscopic procedure than open surgery. If it returns, your doctor will let you know whether you need a repeat procedure.",
        "One study looked at the effectiveness of synovectomy in people with RA of the knee. Around a third of people who had the surgery still had moderate or serious pain afterward. Those without serious knee damage before surgery showed the best results. Researchers noted that surgery didn’t completely stop the disease.",
