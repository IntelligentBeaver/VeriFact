And while there’s a lot you can do to have safer sex, you might not completely avoid STD risks every time. Don't be too hard on yourself, or anyone else, about it.",

If you find that it’s hard to get past feeling betrayed or down about the situation, you may want to talk with a counselor who can help you handle those emotions. Joining a support group is also an option. Ask your doctor for help finding one."
