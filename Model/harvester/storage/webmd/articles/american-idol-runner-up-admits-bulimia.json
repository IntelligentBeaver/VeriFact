        "According to reports in People magazine, McPhee was throwing up seven times a day when she auditioned for the popular TV show American Idol . Before she began shooting, however, McPhee, 22, entered a three-month program at the Los Angeles Eating Disorder Center of California. She first reports her problem in the August issue of Teen People , which hits newsstands June 30.",
        "At the age of 13, McPhee told People , she became obsessed with losing weight, but she didn't begin bingeing and purging until she was 17. As is the case with many co-eds, her problems got worse during college.",
        "About 4% of college-aged women have bulimia, according to statistics from Anorexia Nervosa and Related Eating Disorders , Inc. Bulimia is characterized by bingeing on excessive amounts of food, followed by compensatory purging ( vomiting , using laxatives , excessive exercising) to stave off weight gain.",
        "Untreated, bulimia can have serious medical consequences, such as weakness , potentially fatal heart rhythm abnormalities, kidney damage, and erosion of the teeth . It can also wreak havoc on vocal chords, which can be devastating for a singer like McPhee. That's one of the reasons she decided she needed help."
