        "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare immune disease that causes your body to break down red blood cells when it should not. This disorder happens when there is a problem with certain cells in the bone marrow. In people with PNH, these cells do not work properly and create RBCs that are destroyed by the immune system too easily. When red blood cells are destroyed (also referred to as hemolysis), hemoglobin can be found in the urine (referred to as hemoglobinuria). Hemoglobin is a component of red blood cells that carries oxygen. People with hemoglobinuria may have urine that is dark in color or blood-colored. If hemoglobinuria occurs, it is usually most obvious in the morning.",
        "The symptoms associated with PNH vary greatly from one person to the next. While hemoglobinuria is common, it may not always be noticeable. Another complication of PNH is an increased risk for development of blood clots , some of which can be life-threatening. In addition to the impact on red blood cells, other cells may also be affected, such as white blood cells (which help to fight off infections) and platelets (which help your blood to form clots).",
        "Treatment of PNH targets the specific symptoms you are experiencing. The list below describes different treatment options and the symptoms they target. Your health care provider will help you to determine the best treatment for you."

        "Androgen therapy. Androgens are male hormones that stimulate the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Androgen therapy (for example, danazol) may help to improve the symptoms of anemia caused by hemolysis.",
        "Anticoagulants. These medicines prevent blood clots from forming. Some examples of anticoagulants that may be used in people with PNH are injectable medicines, like enoxaparin, or pills that can be taken orally (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin).",
        "Blood transfusions . People with low levels of blood cells may require blood transfusions. Red blood cell transfusions can help to correct anemia, while platelet transfusions can help to prevent or treat serious bleeding.",
        "Bone marrow transplant . This is a procedure where a person’s bone marrow is destroyed using chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy (or a combination of these), then replaced with healthy bone marrow. In people with PNH, healthy bone marrow usually comes from a donor with a similar genetic makeup to the person with PNH. It is transplanted into the person with PNH by an intravenous infusion. Bone marrow transplantation is the only cure for PNH. However, it can cause severe complications and even death and is reserved only for very severe cases of PNH.",
        "Complement inhibitors. These medicines target the part of the immune system that causes hemolysis of red blood cells. Examples of complement inhibitors used for PNH include Soliris (eculizumab) and Ultomiris (ravulizumab). These medicines work by slowing down the breakdown of red blood cells.",
        "Folic acid (folate). This vitamin supplement can help to support the body as it makes more red blood cells to try to compensate for those destroyed by hemolysis.",
        "Growth factors. Growth factors can help stimulate your bone marrow to produce different types of cells. Examples of growth factors that may be used in people with PNH are: Red blood cell growth factors. Erythropoietin is a growth factor made by the kidneys and stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. Products containing a lab-made form of erythropoietin (for example, Aranesp, Epogen, and Procrit) can reduce the need for blood transfusions by increasing the number of red blood cells. White blood cell growth factors: Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a white blood cell growth factor that stimulates the bone marrow to produce more granulocytes. Granulocytes are a type of white blood cell that help to fight certain infections.",
        "Immunosuppressants. Immunosuppressant drugs, such as antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporine, or eltrombopag, may be used to restore function of the bone marrow. However, these drugs will not have any effect on the genetic mutation that causes PNH.",
        "Iron supplements. People with hemolysis may develop iron deficiency. Iron supplements can help to replace iron lost in the urine.",
        "Steroids. Steroids (for example, prednisone) may help slow the breakdown of red blood cells. Long-term treatment with steroids can cause serious side effects. Your health care provider can help you to decide if steroids are right for you."
