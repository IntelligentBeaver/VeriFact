In North America, they're usually called chiggers. In Britain, they're known as harvest mites. They can also be called berry bugs, bush-mites, red bugs, or scrub-itch mites.",

        "If you're a fan of things that creep and crawl,  you may find chiggers to be really cool. If not, a close-up picture of a chigger may remind you of something out of a horror movie.",
        "Chiggers are no more than 0.3 millimeters long, but zoom in and you'll see that they're hairy and red. (And turn yellow once they're full.) Once chiggers become adults, they have eight legs, but the young ones that bite you only have six. And while chiggers do have mouth parts that can pierce your skin, these pinchers are short and not very strong. That's why chiggers bite soft parts of your skin that fold or wrinkle."
