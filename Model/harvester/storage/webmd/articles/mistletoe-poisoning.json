        "Mistletoe is a plant that often plays a role in Christmas decorations, but in nature, it’s a type of parasitic shrub. Mistletoe survives by digging its roots into a tree and siphoning nutrients and minerals. Mistletoe are not “true” parasites but “hemi parasites” because most of them can photosynthesize on their own. As the mistletoe plants grow, they become a thick tangle of branches that earns them the nickname “witches' broom.”",
        "In the U.S., mistletoe are most often found on black gum, hickory, oak, pecan , and red maple trees. Most healthy trees can manage a few mistletoe infestations, but too many can cause the trees to become weak, especially in situations like disease or drought."
