So it produces antibodies to the toxin – but also to vinculin, said Mark Pimentel, MD, executive director of the Medically Associated Science and Technology program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Disrupting vinculin can lead to poor gut function and an overgrowth of certain bacteria, which contributes to IBS. Pimentel published a study that found 56% of people with IBS tested positive for vinculin antibodies."
