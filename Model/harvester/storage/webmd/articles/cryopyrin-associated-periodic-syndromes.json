        "Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) are a group of rare autoinflammatory diseases that cause problems with your immune system. That’s what protects you from infection and other germs. When it’s not working the right way, it attacks your body instead and triggers inflammation . Symptoms can include a rash , fever, joint pain and swelling, and red eyes.",

        "Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS). Cool or cold temperatures trigger a rash. Other symptoms include fever and joint pain. FCAS is the least severe syndrome. It usually doesn't cause any long-term damage to your body.",

Doctors sometimes call it chronic inflammatory neurological cutaneous articular syndrome (CINCA). NOMID sometimes leads to severe damage to the brain, eyes, and other organs if you don't treat it."
