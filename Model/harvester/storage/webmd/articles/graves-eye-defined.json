        "Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an immune system disorder that affects the way your eyes look and work. The immune system doesn’t function right in people with this condition. That leads to inflammation that causes the muscles and tissues around your eyes to puff up.",
        "In most people, the symptoms of TED are mild. But the condition can be more serious. Often, your eyes will feel dry and irritated. You might get swelling that pushes your eyes forward or affects how you see. It’s rare, but you could even lose your eyesight.",

        "You may have heard thyroid eye disease called Graves’ ophthalmopathy, Graves’ orbitopathy, or Graves' eye disease, but those terms are no longer used.",
