The definition of a primary practice is one that provides first and continuing contact with patients. If your doctor works in a primary care practice, they will refer you to a specialist if you have specific requirements that need advanced knowledge, while they continue to manage your other needs. Your GP can also follow up with specialist recommendations. For example, if your GP thinks you may have multiple sclerosis , you would see a neurologist for an MS diagnosis and treatment. But you would go back to your GP or primary care doctor for other care, such as a sprained ankle, an ear infection, or other health issues not related to MS.",
