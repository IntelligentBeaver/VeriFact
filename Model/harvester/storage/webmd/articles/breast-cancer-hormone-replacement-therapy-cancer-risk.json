        "Hormone replacement therapy, also referred to as HRT, is used to relieve menopause symptoms, especially hot flashes. A woman on hormone therapy usually takes both estrogen and progestin. Women who have had a hysterectomy can take estrogen alone. Estrogen relieves hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. However, taking estrogen alone can increase your risk of developing uterine cancer. Women who have had their uterus removed, called a hysterectomy, can take estrogen alone.",
        "Many studies have looked at the association between hormone replacement therapy and breast cancer. The best evidence for the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy comes from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a large study that started collecting data from post-menopausal healthy women in 1992 The results published in July 2002 showed the risks of combined HRT with estrogen plus progestin outweigh the benefits. These risks included an increase in breast cancer, heart disease, stroke , and blood clots.",
        "Not only does combined HRT increase the risk of developing breast cancer, but it also increases the chances that the cancer will be discovered at a more advanced stage. This is due to its influence in reducing the effectiveness of mammography by creating denser breast tissue."
