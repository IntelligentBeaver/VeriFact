        "When most people think of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), they usually think of babies. But you can get it at any age. And if you’re older than 60, you’re at even greater risk for RSV . “The virus is increasingly recognized as a significant cause of respiratory illness in older adults in the U.S.,” says William Schaffner, MD, a spokesperson and former medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. The CDC estimates that 177,000 older adults are hospitalized every year and 14,000 die from RSV infections. It is a highly contagious respiratory virus. That means it spreads very easily. RSV infects your nose, throat, lungs, and breathing passages. You’ll have symptoms like those of a common cold. RSV can be easily dismissed as a cold in people who are healthy. It’s also easy to confuse RSV with other viruses, like the flu and COVID-19. Loved ones and caregivers should be aware of the chance that RSV in older adults can cause serious sickness or may even be fatal."

Here are some common ways it can happen: A person with RSV coughs or sneezes, and virus droplets get into your nose, eyes, or mouth. You touch a surface – like a kitchen counter or doorknob – that has RSV on it, then either rub your eyes or touch your face without washing your hands. RSV can live on hard surfaces for several hours. You have close contact with someone who is infected with RSV, like an adult or child that you may kiss. If you have RSV, you can be contagious for at least 3-8 days. But if you have a weakened immune system , you can spread the disease for as long as 4 weeks, even if you don’t have symptoms anymore. RSV infections most often happen in the fall, winter, and spring (November to April). But you can get it in any season."
