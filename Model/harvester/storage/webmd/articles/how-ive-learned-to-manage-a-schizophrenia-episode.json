        "If you don’t deal with it early on, an episode can spiral out of control. It’s important that I know what my stressors and symptoms are in order to manage them. Death, conflict with others, and sensory overload are three of my biggest stressors.",
        "All three stressors are equally debilitating, but death is the stressor that affects me the most. It isn’t just the death of a close relative or pet, but death of any kind. Just hearing about death and homicide on the news makes me very uneasy. I often refrain from watching the news during the pandemic to shield myself from the death toll of the lives lost to COVID. When faced with one of these situations, I have to act quickly before my symptoms become elevated."

I start to revisit delusional thoughts and become suspicious of people and my surrounding environment. I become hypervigilant and feel like I’m going to jump out of my skin, which makes it hard for me to function.",
        "Making sure that I take my medications every day as prescribed is one thing that helps me manage an episode if one should arise. But medication isn’t enough to ensure wellness. While medication helps me manage my symptoms, it’s more effective in combination with therapy.",

During this time, I make sure that I’m meeting my basic needs and taking care of myself. Together with my therapist, family, and friends I work to make sure that I’m continuing to bathe, brush my teeth, eat three nutritious meals a day, drink plenty of water, and get proper sleep. This is important because if I begin to let anything in my hygiene regimen slip, my episode will become increasingly worse."

Turning off the television, radio, and staying off social media for short intervals prevents me from overloading my senses and keeps my auditory hallucinations from getting too pronounced.",

The combination of listening to music and engaging in art helps to quiet the auditory hallucinations and soothes me, which helps calm my racing thoughts.",

When I get a delusional thought, I’ve learned to ask myself if what I’m thinking is possible and or probable. Journaling also helps with reality testing. Writing out what I’m thinking and feeling gets things off my chest and I’m able to revisit my entries with my therapist during my sessions to gauge how I’m doing."
