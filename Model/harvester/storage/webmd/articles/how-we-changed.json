        "Hyman, an Ohio attorney specializing in workplace law, says COVID-19 has redefined the nature of work for millions of Americans and businesses. At some workplaces, familiar routines, such as the daily commute and face-to-face meetings, are gone forever. \"When it comes to working from home, that genie is out of the bottle and I don't see it ever going back in,\" he says. \"Employers that were resistant to work-from-home policies had to pivot last March to keep their businesses open. And I think businesses that require 100% in-person attendance as a condition of employment are going to find it really hard to source and retain quality candidates.\" Indeed, Gallup recently reported that 45% of full-time U.S. employees are working from home all or part of the time -- down from a peak of 83% in April 2020 -- based on the polling organization's nationally representative surveys. That's up from just 17% before the pandemic. In addition: Two thirds of white-collar workers (67%) are working from home exclusively (41%) or some of the time (26%). 91% hope to continue working remotely because it eliminates a daily commute and office distractions, affords flexibility in balancing work and personal obligations, and improves their \"overall well-being.\" Three in 10 say they will seek another job if their company eliminates remote work. Nearly 50% said they would take a pay cut to continue working from home, according to a survey by Owl Labs and Global Workplace Analytics. But it's not just employees who are embracing the work-from-home trend. Many employers plan to continue allowing remote work in the future, citing reduced costs for office space and overhead and virtual meetings and video chats replacing the need for business travel, conference planning, and other once-common practices."

        "Beyond the work-from-home trend, many workplace experts say the pandemic has altered the balance of power between employees and employers at many companies. Since March 2020, millions of Americans have left jobs for positions they believe offer a better balance between their personal and professional lives. In fact, the trend is so significant that workplace experts have described it as \"The Great Resignation.\" University of California-Berkeley economist Ulrike Malmendier argues that COVID-19 lockdowns and the rise of remote work have led to major shifts in how many of us view our lives and our careers. \"Even for those who were lucky enough to avoid infection, life began to look very different,\" she says. \"Most workplaces were closed, and people started working from home. Essential workers still showed up at their workplaces -- the hospitals, the grocery stores, the delivery service sites -- but did so in masks and PPE, and under very different workplace rules. \"Most of these challenges were expected to be time-limited,\" she says. \"Once the health risks subsided and our schedules and support systems resumed, we would return to a prepandemic way of living -- or so we thought. And yet, despite these expectations, there were early signs that this pandemic experience might leave its mark on us in the long run.\""

Instead, he and his wife order takeout, attend only outdoor concerts, and stream films and shows at home. And Crowe doesn't expect that to change any time soon. \"I don't ever want to be anywhere indoors where I'm shoulder -to-shoulder with people who may not be vaccinated,\" he says. \"Concerts, movie theaters, waiting for a table at a restaurant [or] even standing in line at a retail store. I'm pretty much done [with] doing anything inside with a bunch of people I don't know.\" And the Crowes aren't alone. Millions of Americans have avoided indoor concerts, movie theaters, entertainment centers, churches, and retail stores during the pandemic. Netflix and other online streaming services are benefiting, as are Amazon and manufacturers of home-theater systems. At the same time, musical artists, Broadway theaters, and film studios have turned to streaming services to deliver media and content.",

Although the trend is slowing, according to the latest figures, experts don't expect the at-home streaming to go away.

It has also amplified social divisions and has made it harder for many people to separate fact from fiction and to distinguish big risks from small ones.
