        "Palsonify is a medicine for certain people with acromegaly . Acromegaly is a rare disorder that happens when your body makes too much growth hormone (GH). This hormone is made and released in the pituitary gland in your brain. In children, GH stimulates growth and development. In adults, GH affects energy levels, muscle strength, bone health, and one’s sense of well-being.",
        "When you have too much GH in your blood, your liver makes too much of another hormone called insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1). This hormone also makes your bones and other body parts grow more than they should. Too much IGF-1 can change the way your body handles blood sugar and fats, which causes other health conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Symptoms usually happen over a long period of time. You may have unusually large hands and feet, changes in ring size or your shoe width, or changes in your face. Other symptoms may include joint pain, stiff, rough body hair, a deep voice, sweating, headaches, low energy, weakness and being tired, depression , vision problems, less strength, loss of muscle mass, or an increase in body fat."

        "The most common cause of acromegaly is a benign (noncancerous) tumor in your pituitary gland called a pituitary adenoma. While very rare, tumors outside the pituitary (ectopic tumors) can cause acromegaly by producing growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which then stimulates the pituitary to make too much GH. The most common locations for these rare ectopic tumors are the lung, pancreas, and adrenal glands.",
        "The main treatment for acromegaly that is caused by a pituitary tumor is surgery. About half of people who have surgery still have too much GH and IGF-1. Radiation therapy may be used if there are parts of a tumor left after surgery or to stop the tumor from growing. Medicines are used after surgery to help control the disease and bring hormone levels back to normal. The somatostatin analogs lanreotide , octreotide, and pasireotide are used to lower GH and IGF-1 levels. The medicine pegvisomant blocks the effects of growth hormone in your body.",
