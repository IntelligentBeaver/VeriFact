        "Black seed is the common name for the seeds of the Nigella sativa plant. This plant is a small shrub with green leaves and white and purplish flowers. It grows worldwide, but most commonly in southern and eastern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and southwest Asia. It’s also known as nigella, black cumin, fennel flower, black caraway, Roman coriander, Habbatul Barakah (Arabic), and Tikur azmud (Amharic).",

        "Black seed oil is extracted from these seeds. Capsules of the oil may be found in health stores and online. The oil and the seeds, which can be eaten raw or lightly toasted, have long been used as medicinal plants in the regions where N. sativa is grown. It even appears in the words of the Prophet Muhammad, who describes the seeds as \"a remedy for every illness except death.\" Early herb specialists described it as \"the herb from heaven.\" The seeds were also mentioned in the Holy Bible and ancient Greek medicine."
