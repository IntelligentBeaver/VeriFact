        "They are smiling. In the background, you can glimpse a clear blue sky and a shimmering flat lake. Kneeling in the sand are two kids. The older girl has on a pink and green bathing suit, and the little boy is wearing swim trunks with a puddle jumper. The boy has a chipped red plastic shovel in his hand, and the girl is holding a lime green pool noodle. Both are grinning from ear to ear. Of course, they are. I imagine the warmth of the sun on my skin. If I close my eyes, I can practically hear the water lapping on the shore and feel the sand between my toes.",
        "This beautiful scene is enough to make me want to throw my phone across the room. I don't. Instead, I feel an intense wave of anger, envy, and shame wash over me. Why can't I just suck it up and pack the beach bags? The kids would absolutely love a beach day. I'm just being a lazy, bad parent keeping my kids at home on such a nice weekend. All the other families are out and about doing fun activities except us. I need to stop using my chronic illness as an excuse. My kids are missing out and are going to hate me for it. My brain spirals out of control with anxious thoughts."

Even if I do feel like I can handle it that day, I need to be careful that I don't overdo it, or I will pay for it for days. Plus, the heat seems to aggravate my symptoms.",

I'm sure others have looked at my posts and wished that they had “insert random thing they are insecure about.” Maybe it's money for such and such, maybe it's more support from family. Except nothing is what it seems. Those smiling kids on the beach are soon crying over having sand in their eyes. Or the mom has a meltdown trying to catch up on the housework she missed that day. Maybe the day turns so bad that they vow not to return to the beach again that summer. I try and remember this when I am feeling green with envy for someone else's perceived life."

        "In addition, my kids’ happiness seems to be about balance, not amazing, exhausting outings. Kids don't need extravagant trips or outings every single weekend. On the flip side, my kids don't seem happy, and neither do I, if we are in the house watching TV all day. Fond memories are made splashing in the small plastic pool in the backyard or spraying each other with the hose. My kids gush about the amazing time they had watching a movie and eating buttery popcorn in their special living room turned fort. Some of my favorite memories are just taking a drive to get ice cream while blasting music and having a car dance party.",

For me, this usually involves nature or a family event with my kids’ cousins. I will gladly risk a flare-up for a serene paddle down the river or a busy family birthday party. If I am honest with myself, I will usually not risk it for a beach day.",
        "In order to put myself first, I have had to learn to say no to things. I am not able to care for my kids if I am in a major flare-up because I wanted to do ALL of the things. Most people seem to understand. Some don't seem to get it, but they don't need to. I just need to keep the big picture in mind and try and make the best out of the mundane life experience. These are the moments that really make up my life, and prioritizing makes me happier and more joyful to be around. I just need to remember that when the comparison and envy start to creep in."
