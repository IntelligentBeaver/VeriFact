        "Glucosamine/chondroitin (Cosequin, Dasuquin, Glycoflex, Phycox) is a dietary supplement you can give your dog or cat to help treat osteoarthritis . It’s also used to treat feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD). You can buy glucosamine and chondroitin separately, but they’re usually sold and used together.",
        "Glucosamine and chondroitin are natural parts of healthy cartilage, the connective tissues that cover and cushion the tips of long bones. The supplements are usually made from the cartilage of sea mollusks, sharks, cows, pigs, and chickens, though some are made in labs.",
        "Glucosamine is an anti-inflammatory and helps your pet’s joints make cartilage, while chondroitin prevents their cartilage from breaking down and also helps their body produce more cartilage.",
        "You don’t need a prescription from your vet for glucosamine/chondroitin because it’s a supplement, which means it enhances your pet’s diet with things like vitamins, minerals, and probiotics . Because supplements like glucosamine/chondroitin are considered dietary, the FDA regulates them as a food, not as medicine.",
        "It’s best to talk to your vet before you give your pet glucosamine/chondroitin. There are many types available, and some are better than others. You can get supplements for your pet from your veterinarian or from most pet stores."
