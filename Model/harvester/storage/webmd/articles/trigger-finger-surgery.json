        "Trigger finger is the common name for a hand condition your doctor might call stenosing tenosynovitis. It happens when something inflames a band of tissue called a \"pulley,\" which holds the tendon to the finger bone. This narrows the space in the tube, or \"sheath\" around the tendon and causes stiffness and pain.",
        "If you have trigger finger, you might feel a little bump that catches when you use the finger. After a while, it can lock your finger into a bent position.",
        "It isn't clear what causes trigger finger, but repeated or strenuous hand movement seems to play a part. And your risk goes up if you have rheumatoid arthritis , diabetes, or gout .",
        "Your doctor might recommend treatment with rest, splints, exercises, anti-inflammatory pills, and steroid shots. If these methods don't work, and your trigger finger prevents you from doing the things you normally do, you and your doctor might discuss surgery.",

Once your doctor says it's safe, gently wash the area every day with warm, soapy water, and pat it dry. Avoid using hydrogen peroxide or alcohol, as these can slow down healing. If the incision leaks a little or rubs against your clothing, you can cover it with a clean gauze bandage. Change the bandage each day, and keep the area clean and dry.",
