Because the nerves leading to the heart are cut during the operation, the transplanted heart beats faster (about 100 to 110 beats per minute) than the normal heart (about 70 beats per minute). The donor heart also responds more slowly to exercise and doesn't increase its rate as quickly as before.",

A diet with healthy fats and low sodium will decrease the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and fluid retention. Your doctor will discuss your specific dietary needs, and a registered dietitian can help you understand specific dietary guidelines."
