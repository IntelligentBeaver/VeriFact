        "Giant puffball mushrooms or Calvatia gigantean are medicinal mushrooms that grow on decaying plant material. You can find them near the edges or openings of forests and in open woods, grassy fields, parks, lawns, or meadows. You may also find them under small trees.",
        "They are found in the central and eastern United States and Canada in the late summer and fall from May to October. You may see giant puffballs alone or in groups, growing directly on the ground or rotten wood.",
        "Giant puffballs are huge round or pear-shaped fungi containing numerous spores — a 10- to 15-inch-wide giant puffball is said to contain 7 trillion spores. Giant puffballs can grow as big as a soccer ball or watermelon. The largest giant puffball reported was 8.6 feet wide and weighed 48 pounds.",
        "A giant puffball’s flesh is known as the gleba. When the mushroom is young, the flesh is white and has a marshmallow-like texture. As it matures, its flesh turns yellow or brown and powdery due to mature spores. When a giant puffball mushroom breaks or withers, the spores are released into the environment for reproduction."
