        "Nov. 18, 2024 – An E. coli bacteria outbreak traced to organic carrots has hospitalized 15 people and is now linked to the death of one person in California.",
        "In total, 39 people have been sickened, according to the CDC . The carrots were sold nationwide, and illnesses have spanned 18 states coast to coast, with eight people sickened in Washington state, five people in Minnesota, and five people in New York.",
        "The carrots were sold from Aug. 14 to Oct. 23. Recalled products include more than a dozen brand names for various sizes of packages of baby carrots and of whole organic carrots. The brand names include 365, Full Circle, Good & Gather, GreenWise, Nature’s Promise, and others. The carrots were sold at a variety of stores nationwide, including Trader Joe’s and Wegmans.",
        "The FDA said its investigation is still ongoing. Meanwhile, health officials are urging people to check their refrigerators for the carrots. Baby carrot packages have best-if-used-by dates between Sept. 11 and Nov. 12. Whole organic carrot packages don’t have best-if-used-by dates printed on them."
