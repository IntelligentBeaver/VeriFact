        "When you have obesity, finding the right balance between accepting yourself as you are and taking steps toward better health is tricky. Obesity simply means you have more body fat or a higher body mass index (BMI). You may or may not have other related metabolic health problems, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. But obesity’s effects on your life and experiences can go much deeper, affecting not just your physical health but your mental health as well.",
        "As you look ahead to your future, you may wonder where to start. The answer to that question is complex, says Shiara Ortiz-Pujols, MD, MPH, medical director of obesity medicine at Northwell Health in Staten Island, New York.",
        "“It requires a lot of different steps,” Ortiz-Pujols says. “A lot of people have been struggling with weight for much of their lives, especially if they’ve been doing it since adolescence. There was likely a lot of bullying, a lot of assumptions that may have even affected a lot of opportunities. There’s a certain amount of trauma that comes from all of that weight bias that leads to internalized stigma and almost self-hatred. Often people come to me and they’re feeling almost hopeless. Many people will not even seek routine preventive care because often when they’ve gone to a doctor, the first thing that comes out of the doctor’s mouth is, ‘You need to lose weight,’ and oftentimes they don’t feel heard.”"

So this shows that internalized weight stigma is potentially creating barriers for adults engaged in weight management.”"
