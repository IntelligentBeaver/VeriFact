        "A recent study has found that Black women may be at a higher risk for uterine cancer because of harmful chemicals in some hair straightening products. These chemicals affect your body’s hormones. Experts consider them carcinogenic, or cancer-causing. While there have been other studies about how these products may increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers, there is limited data about straightening products and uterine cancer.",
        "It’s important to remember that while the risk is higher for people who use straightening products, uterine cancer is still a rare form of cancer. It is one of the most common gynecological cancers, though."
