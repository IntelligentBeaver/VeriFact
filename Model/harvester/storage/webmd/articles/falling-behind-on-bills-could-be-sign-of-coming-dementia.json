        "July 9, 2024 – Declining credit rating scores later in life may be an early warning sign of dementia , according to a new analysis published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
        "Credit scores are used to predict a person’s likelihood to pay back a loan on time and are important for people seeking a mortgage, credit card, or car loan. Factors that can influence a person’s credit score include their history of paying bills on time – including medical bills -- current unpaid debts, how much available credit is being used, new applications for credit, and whether any debts have been sent to collection or resulted in foreclosure or bankruptcy.",
        "The new report , titled “The Financial Consequences of Undiagnosed Memory Disorders,” is based on reporting data from credit agency Equifax that was merged with Medicare data by linking people’s Social Security numbers. The analysis was based on a representative sample using data spanning 14 years for more than 2.4 million people. The estimated incidence of Alzheimer’s disease or related disorders was nearly 1% among people ages 65 to 74, nearly 3% for people ages 75 to 84, and just over 6% for people ages 85 and older."
