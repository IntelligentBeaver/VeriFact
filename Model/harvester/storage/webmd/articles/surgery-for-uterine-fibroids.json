        "A myomectomy is an operation to remove fibroids without removing the uterus (womb). Fibroids are growths of tissue and muscle cells found inside or outside your uterus. Fibroids are usually noncancerous but can be big, small, one, few, or many.",
        "It's unclear what causes fibroids, but it's very common for women to have them in their 40s and early 50s. About 70% of white women and 80% of Black women in America have uterine fibroids by age 50. Fibroids may not cause any symptoms, but if they do, these could be heavy and painful periods and pain in the pelvis or back. Having fibroids doesn't keep you from getting pregnant, but sometimes they cause a miscarriage, pregnancy complication, or premature birth.",

Your doctor may recommend this type of uterine fibroid surgery if you don't want to have any or any more children because with a myomectomy, there is the possibility of fibroids coming back. However, if you want to keep your ability to have children or want to preserve your uterus, then you should look into a myomectomy."
