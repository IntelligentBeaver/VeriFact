        "Eat more fiber. A high-fiber diet is one of the best ways to treat your hemorrhoids. A diet that includes a lot of high-fiber foods can help keep your poop softer and easier to pass. If you have to strain to poop, it puts pressure on the veins in your anus and rectum. This can cause the veins to swell, which leads to hemorrhoids. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that you eat 14 grams of fiber a day for every 1,000 calories you eat. So, if you eat 2,000 calories a day, you should eat about 28 grams of fiber a day. Fortunately, foods high in fiber are also foods that doctors and dieticians recommend for good health anyway, such as grains, fruits, vegetables , and beans.",
        "Take fiber supplements if you can't get enough fiber from food. Doctors recommend fiber supplements with psyllium (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel). Don't take laxatives , because they can cause diarrhea , which may irritate your hemorrhoids.",
        "Stay hydrated. This is another way you can help prevent constipation and the need to strain when you poop. The U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends adults drink 12-16 cups of water (96-128 oz) every day. You may need to drink more if you're very active, live in a hot area, are pregnant or nursing, or are sick.",
        "Use soothing wipes to clean yourself after you poop. You can try using wet baby wipes, wet toilet paper, or a washcloth. Whatever you choose, don't rub roughly. To avoid irritating your hemorrhoids, gently pat to clean yourself.",
        "Apply ointments, creams, or lotions made for hemorrhoids.",
        "Sit in a warm bath (sometimes called a sitz bath). It’s a time-honored therapy: Sit in about 3 inches of warm (not hot) water for 15-20 minutes several times a day. This helps relax your clenching sphincter muscle, which increases blood flow and helps reduce itching and irritation. You can take a sitz bath in your bathtub, or buy a small plastic tub that fits over your toilet.",
        "Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ), such as ibuprofen or naproxen, to help ease the pain and inflammation of your hemorrhoids.",
        "Apply a cold compress. A simple cold pack on the tender area for a few minutes can help numb it and bring down the swelling."

        "Hemorrhoidectomy (hemorrhoid removal). This is the most effective way to treat large external or prolapsing internal hemorrhoids or those that keep coming back. Most of the time, hemorrhoids removed this way don't come back. The operation itself is usually simple, but your recovery can take 2-8 weeks. Most people who have had hemorrhoidectomy say that their pain is gone after about 2 weeks, but it can take 6-8 weeks before you can return to hard exercise or physical work. Some surgeons may use an electrothermal device to do this surgery, a method that results in quicker healing and lesser pain for some people.",

Your recovery will likely be faster and less painful than with hemorrhoidectomy. However, there’s also a higher chance of your hemorrhoids coming back or getting rectal prolapse (when part of your rectum pushes out of your anus)."

            "Hemorrhoidectomy (hemorrhoid removal). This is the most effective way to treat large external or prolapsing internal hemorrhoids or those that keep coming back. Most of the time, hemorrhoids removed this way don't come back. The operation itself is usually simple, but your recovery can take 2-8 weeks. Most people who have had hemorrhoidectomy say that their pain is gone after about 2 weeks, but it can take 6-8 weeks before you can return to hard exercise or physical work. Some surgeons may use an electrothermal device to do this surgery, a method that results in quicker healing and lesser pain for some people.",
            "Hemorrhoidopexy (hemorrhoid stapling). This is usually only used for internal hemorrhoids. It cuts off blood flow to your hemorrhoids and also moves prolapsed tissue back in place. Your recovery will likely be faster and less painful than with hemorrhoidectomy. However, there’s also a higher chance of your hemorrhoids coming back or getting rectal prolapse (when part of your rectum pushes out of your anus)."
