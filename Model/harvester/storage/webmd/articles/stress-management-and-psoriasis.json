        "Stress is one of the biggest triggers for psoriasis flares. Life can be pretty stressful, and we will always find ourselves in challenging moments. But there’s no avoiding stress, so the key is finding ways to manage our stress levels. There are several techniques and remedies to assist with the pressures of life.",
        "Following a healthy diet can help manage stress and psoriasis symptoms. Foods high in vitamin C, magnesium, omega-3s, lean proteins, antioxidants, and complex carbs may help build the immune system, protect us from the cell damage caused by stress, and balance our moods. Intaking a lot of sugar and unsaturated fats is easy to do when stressed but can actually make our moods and psoriasis symptoms worse. Sugar depletes the nervous system of calcium, which is the nutrient that helps to keep us from be irritable.",
        "Along with foods are certain herbs that are great with helping with stress, anxiety, and depression. Some herbs that can provide relief on these effects on the nervous system include lavender, lemon balm, oat straw, and chamomile, just to name a few. My go-to blend is lemon balm, lavender, roses, and chamomile with lemon and honey. It’s so calming and relaxing to the body, especially after a long day."

        "Exercising regularly is another healthy way to cope with stress. I definitely notice a difference with my skin when I skip out on my workout routine. Keeping the body moving helps with the flow of the lymphatic system, and the lymphatic system clears the toxins that contribute to psoriasis flares. If you’re not up for running or strength training, there are so many options to choose from when it comes to physical activity. Examples include swimming, dancing, yoga, bicycling, tennis, and the list goes on. Just 30 minutes a day can really make a difference.",
        "In today’s climate, we’re always on the go with a list of things to do, which makes it hard to just simply relax. I had to force myself to slow down, and even if it’s just for 5 minutes, take a moment to do some relaxation techniques. Stretching, mediating, and deep breathing help to reset the nervous system, release anxiety and stress, and increase energy."
