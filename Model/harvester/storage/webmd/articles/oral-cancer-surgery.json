        "Oral cancer surgery refers to a group of procedures with different jobs: removing cancer, rebuilding areas affected by treatment, or restoring key functions like eating, speaking, or swallowing. It’s usually the first treatment doctors suggest, especially when the tumor can be removed completely.",
        "“A good amount of patients that have surgery do go on to have radiation and maybe chemotherapy , but we always start with surgery – it has the best cure possibility,” says Ansley Roche, MD, head and neck oncologic and reconstructive surgeon with Smilow Cancer Hospital.",

        "You may also need surgery on nearby areas like the salivary glands, lymph nodes in the neck, or your throat. But if the cancer starts in the part of the throat right behind your mouth, including the tonsils , it's called oropharyngeal cancer, and your treatment plan may be different. There are several types of throat cancer – oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancer."
