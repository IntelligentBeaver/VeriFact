        "April 13, 2023 – A small new study suggests that obstructive sleep apnea may cause problems with thinking skills.",
        "The study compared cognitive functions among men with sleep apnea with those of men who didn’t have the sleep disorder. Researchers found that those with sleep apnea were less able to concentrate, had a poorer memory, and had poorer social judgment.",
        "Previously, trouble with brain functions like memory and concentration among people with sleep apnea were linked to also having another health issue such as obesity, high blood pressure, or type 2 diabetes.",
        "People with the most severe sleep apnea had the poorest cognitive function. The study included 27 males with untreated obstructive sleep apnea who took part in sleep studies and cognitive testing at Kings College London in England. The men were otherwise healthy and ranged in age from 35 to 70 years old. The findings were published this month in Frontiers in Sleep .",
        "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea and results in blocked airflow into or out of the mouth or nose, even when someone is trying to breathe. As many as 18 million people in the U.S. may have sleep apnea, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine , but it is more common among people who are obese."
