        "While advocates acknowledge a lack of scientific studies of the effectiveness of dating violence prevention programs targeted at teenagers, the few published evaluations show at least some promising results. Writing in the October 2000 issue of the American Journal of Public Health , researchers from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill reported that a year after participating in \"Safe Dates,\" an adolescent dating violence prevention program, teenagers reported less psychological and physical abuse involving their dating partners. The researchers wrote that changes in dating violence norms -- that is, what might be tolerated -- gender stereotyping, and awareness of counseling and intervention services could explain the program's positive effects. They plan on following the teenagers for five years following their participation in Safe Dates.",

While inroads are being made in schools, \"it is another item on a full plate for teachers. There is concern for the child's well-being because [the school] may not know the proper resources or referrals.\""
