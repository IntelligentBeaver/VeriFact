It starts with changes in bone marrow stem cells. Those different stem cells then make copies and divide. This can cause scar tissue and a “crowding out” of healthy cells. It usually means you won’t have enough red blood cells, which causes anemia. This is the most common form of myelofibrosis. Secondary myelofibrosis happens after you have other bone marrow disorders. Only about 10%-20% of people who have myelofibrosis have this type."

They target the JAK genes that can cause problems in how blood cells are made. Both can be taken in pill form. Spleen removal (splenectomy): In most cases, doctors will perform “keyhole” surgery (laparoscopy), which is an operation that requires only small cuts. They’ll insert a tiny camera into the small cut in your belly area. The camera sends pictures to a video screen so the surgeon can do the operation.
