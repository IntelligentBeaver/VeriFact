        "If you have symptoms of peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) and medicines and lifestyle changes aren’t enough to control it, you might need surgery. An endarterectomy is one of the common surgeries doctors can use to treat your narrowed arteries , improve blood flow, and relieve symptoms of PAD.",
        "The surgery involves removing fatty substances called plaques from your arteries. It’s most likely you’ll have this procedure if you have a lot of plaque and your arteries are severely narrowed.",
        "Surgeons most often use an endarterectomy to open large blood vessels when there is a blockage or narrowing at places where your arteries branch off. Sometimes this can happen in the carotid arteries, the pair of blood vessels on both sides of your neck that send blood to your head and brain. Doctors call the procedure to remove plaque from the carotids a carotid endarterectomy.",
        "Most endarterectomy procedures aim to restore blood flow to the femoral artery , which is in the top of your thigh. PAD is the most common condition that affects this artery. It’s a major blood vessel for carrying blood to your lower body and is important for normal blood flow to your legs. Your doctor may recommend you have a femoral endarterectomy depending on where your blockage is and how serious it is.",
        "Your surgeon might do an endarterectomy at the same time as another procedure called bypass surgery . In bypass surgery, surgeons use part of one of your veins or a synthetic tube to create a new path for blood to flow around severely narrowed or blocked arteries. In PAD, bypass surgery can help to restore blood flow to your legs."
