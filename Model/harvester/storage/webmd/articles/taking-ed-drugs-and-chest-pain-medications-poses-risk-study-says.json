But the study -- published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology -- says using such ED medications and nitrates could have an impact on mortality and morbidity rates.",

        "Men in the combination group had a slightly elevated risk of premature death from all causes. The risk for having undergone revascularization during the follow-up period was twice that of the nitrates-only group."
