But I started reacting to foods that’d never been a problem. My energy plummeted. Symptoms I’d learned to manage started slipping out of control, and I couldn’t pinpoint why. Something wasn’t right."

        "I decided to get a comprehensive gut test through Genova. At the time, I was pescatarian and still relatively unaware of how deep the gut-autoimmune connection is. My results were eye-opening. Dysbiosis. Low microbial diversity. Overgrowth of opportunistic bacteria. Low secretory IgA. Impaired short-chain fatty acid production. Sluggish digestion. It was clear my gut was underperforming, and had been for a while.",
        "Suddenly, everything clicked. If your gut is inflamed or overrun with the wrong bacteria, your immune system will be on high alert. That background inflammation adds fuel to the fire of an autoimmune condition like MG.",
        "Once I understood what was going on, I took action. First through food. I was already eating a whole food diet, but I fine-tuned it. I eliminated gluten, dairy, seed oils, and refined sugar. I focused on nutrient-dense, anti-inflammatory meals. I reintroduced grass-fed beef, offal, and other quality animal proteins. I kept my meals simple, intentional, and supportive. That alone made a difference."

I added digestive enzymes, spore-based probiotics, and made a real effort to eat slowly, chew properly, and stay calm while eating.",

Gut health was no longer just a vague wellness term – it became a key part of taking care of myself every day.",
