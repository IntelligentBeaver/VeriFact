        "What you put on your plate may help you see clearly into the future – literally. Eating the right foods can protect against age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the top cause of blindness in older adults. \"Like the rest of your body, your eyes need oxygen and nutrients to work properly,\" says Purnima Patel, MD, a clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. A healthy diet supports the macula, the part of the eye damaged by AMD.",

        "AMD is very common: One in nine people 40 and older have it. There's no cure for the disease. But if you have it, eating certain foods – and avoiding others – can slow down how quickly it worsens. This may stave off the changes that can lead to blind spots and harm your central vision (the part that you use for seeing details, reading, and recognizing faces). Find out which foods may safeguard against AMD – and which ones you should scale back on."

Oxidative stress can cause damage and inflammation to part of the eye called the retina, says Ninel Gregori, MD, a professor of clinical ophthalmology and the Lois Pope endowed chair for age-related macular degeneration research at the University of Miami School of Medicine. This can affect the macula, a small area in the retina responsible for central vision, and add to AMD. Research showed that people who eat at least five ounces of fruit – a little more than half a cup – daily were nearly 15% less likely to develop AMD, compared to those who didn't.",
