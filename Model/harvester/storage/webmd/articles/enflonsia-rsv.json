Most infants are infected within the first year of life. While most people have mild symptoms, others can develop more serious symptoms, such as pneumonia , which may require hospitalization. People at highest risk of serious symptoms include the very old, the very young, and people who are pregnant or have certain medical conditions that involve the immune system , heart, or lungs .",
