        "One thing not many people understand about life behind the HIV curtain is just how many things there are to really, truly consider. Finding your way to acceptance of an HIV-positive diagnosis while also managing your personal feelings and emotions about the situation can feel like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.",
        "There's also the “health maintenance” component we each have to deal with: developing a routine for doctor visits, getting routine lab work, eating healthy, getting enough rest and exercise, and avoiding stress. That would all be enough as is, right?",
        "Then there’s also the act of disclosing your HIV status to others, which is almost always directly connected to concerns about safety and harm, not to mention ridicule, judgment, and stigma. Add to this list all that comes along with sex and dating as a person living with HIV , and you’ve got a pretty serious laundry list of issues to face."
