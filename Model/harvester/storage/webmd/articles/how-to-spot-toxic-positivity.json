        "Some people seem to use positivity to fuel their egos with smug self-congratulation. They have an air of being above it all, untouched by the problems and distress that burden the rest of us. And yet there’s a falseness to it -- a positive veneer that’s covering a deeper layer of negativity and insecurity. True contentment doesn’t need to flaunt itself.",

Whenever I asked how he was doing, the answer was always the same: “Great!” He never had any problems to talk about; if I ever described one of mine he would smile and say something encouraging and optimistic. I really liked and enjoyed seeing him, but I wondered why our relationship never seemed to go anywhere. We never made a point to get together and only ever saw one another in class or in passing."
