        "Despite recent progress, disparities in health and health care continue for many chronic conditions, including hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). HS more often affects members of the Black community. Differences in care and access to care can make those disparities worse. For example, one study in the U.S. found it took Black people with HS years longer to get an HS diagnosis, compared to White patients. White patients also got in to see a dermatologist for their HS much sooner. As a result, Black people with HS often have more severe disease before it's treated. \"I've had great care and I've had care that could have been improved,\" says Jasmine Ivanna Espy, founder and CEO of The Association of Hidradenitis Suppurativa and Inflammatory Diseases (AHSID) based in Detroit, who has HS. \"I've also had care that I absolutely don't ever want to have again.\""

        "One way to overcome disparities in health care for HS and other conditions is to improve cultural competency among doctors and other health care providers. You can improve your own HS treatment and outlook by learning all you can and looking for a dermatologist who is culturally competent. This means that they're willing to listen to your concerns and meet your needs in ways that fit with your own personal wishes. Cultural competence is about how we \"build rapport with patients and make sure we give them the care not only that they need, but the care that they want, and take their desires for their own health care into consideration when we're practicing shared decision making around their dermatologic care or health care in general,\" says Haley Naik, MD, a dermatologist and HS specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. \"As it relates to HS patients, I think this is really important to consider because HS patients run the gamut. They're a broad spectrum of patients who are as young as adolescents up through older adults. They are largely women, but men are definitely affected by HS. This is a condition that impacts racially and ethnically diverse individuals and a disease that causes disability. So really understanding where patients are coming from – what their needs are, what their functional goals are, and what their goals for their care are – is fundamental to being able to provide that care.\""

By acknowledging when you've had experiences that weren't positive, you'll find it easier to recognize it if it happens again and advocate for yourself in those moments, Espy says. You'll also learn to recognize when a doctor you're seeing is not someone you want to continue with. \"Patients should know that you don't have to stick with a medical professional just because they're a medical professional,\" Espy says. \"If somebody doesn't treat you right, you don't have to see them again. You could definitely go elsewhere, and I know that that's easier said than done in certain situations, but definitely empower yourself to find a different person in your care team if they're not giving you what you need.\"",

She says treatment and care for all people with HS is improving as more is known about the disease and how to treat it. \"My bias is that everyone should be practicing culturally competent care,\" she says. \"I think the tension here, as it relates to HS, is that for a long time, there's been very little knowledge about HS. That's changing now. For a long time, doctors were not making timely diagnoses of HS. Patients weren't getting referred to dermatologists. Now that we have new therapies available to treat HS, we're seeing that change a lot.\" For now, she still suggests seeing an experienced dermatologist or HS specialist who can help to devise the best treatment path for you based on your concerns, preferences, and available treatments. Once a treatment plan is in place, you may be able to see a community dermatologist you trust closer to home for your continued care."
