They set limits on what providers can charge, so some professionals will not accept Medicare coverage. But enough still do so that we can usually find a doctor we like who will take Medicare.",
        "Like most people, I started with Medicare Parts A and B, which all SSDI beneficiaries get. Part A covers hospitalization, including inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facilities, hospice, or home health visits. Part B covers medical services including ambulances, durable medical equipment such as oxygen, wheelchairs and walkers, mental health care, lab fees, and inpatient and outpatient doctor services. So, most people with MS need parts A and B."
