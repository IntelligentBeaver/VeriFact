        "Inflammation is the body's way to heal an injury or damaged cells. In the liver, this injury can be caused by many things, including an infection, toxins, or the buildup of fat. This inflammation can lead to changes in the liver if it persists. Changes like fibrosis, or scarring of the tissue in the liver, may lead to cirrhosis .",
