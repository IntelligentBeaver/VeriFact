Multiple medications can come with the risk of TD as a side effect. Some of the most common ones include: Antipsychotics for several different mental health conditions Gastrointestinal medications Malaria medications Medications to treat neurological problems Whichever doctor you’re visiting, it’s important to remember that they prescribed that particular medication for a reason. So you shouldn’t stop taking it before talking to them. When possible, your doctor will change, adjust, or stop your medication. They might also lower your dose slowly over time. Adjusting the medicine that’s causing your TD usually improves the symptoms, and sometimes, it can stop them completely. But if this first step doesn’t help, there are other steps you can take."

        "If your doctor’s medication changes don’t help you enough, you might want to talk to someone who has special expertise in this condition. TD, which is a movement disorder, is a neurological problem. You can get help from a neurologist who is a movement disorder specialist. Ask your doctor for a referral or do a search for this type of specialist online. A movement disorder specialist may suggest one or more of a few different treatment options for your TD, including prescription medication, procedures, and supplements. Here’s a little more about the various treatment options, so you can prepare to talk about them with the specialist. Prescription medications Doctors may prescribe a medication from a category of medicines called vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors. They change the activity of certain chemicals in your brain that affect muscles, nerves, and movement. These medications include: Deutetrabenazine (Austedo) Tetrabenazine (Xenazine) Valbenazine (Ingrezza)"
