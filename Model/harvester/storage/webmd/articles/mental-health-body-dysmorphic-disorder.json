        "Body dysmorphia, also called body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), is a mental health disorder that leads to extreme distress over your appearance. You may think certain parts of your body are defects. Other people may not be able to notice the flaws you perceive, or they see them as minimal. This may cause psychological distress that can interfere with your everyday life.",
        "Body dysmorphia is related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but it is often misdiagnosed. If you have it, you may feel an urgent need to perform certain routines or compulsions, such as checking a mirror, avoiding mirrors, or grooming yourself excessively.",
        "People with body dysmorphia often develop certain rituals related to their appearance, like excessive grooming. (Photo Credit: WebMD)",
        "Body dysmorphia can affect anyone. It usually begins during the teen years or early adulthood. In the U.S., about 2.4% of adults have BDD, which affects slightly more women and people assigned female at birth than men and people assigned male at birth.",
        "Body dysmorphia vs. gender dysphoria",
        "While the term \"body dysmorphia\" may sound similar to \"gender dysphoria,\" the two are different. Gender dysphoria refers to the psychological distress a person may have if the gender they identify with doesn't align with the sex they were assigned at birth. If you have gender dysphoria, you may feel that your external appearance doesn’t match the gender you identify with. Although both body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria can cause distress about your physical appearance, body dysmorphia usually involves being too concerned about perceived flaws in your appearance, not a mismatch related to gender.",
        "Not all people who are transgender, genderqueer, gender fluid, or nonbinary, or who identify outside the traditional gender binary have gender dysphoria. But some may experience it because of this mismatch. Some people may have both gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia."
