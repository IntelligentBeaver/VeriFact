        "Sleepiness caused by narcolepsy",
        "Sunosi was studied in a trial that included more than 200 adults with narcolepsy. They were told to take Sunosi or placebo pills (containing no medicine) once daily for 12 weeks. The dose used in the trial was either 75 milligrams, 150 milligrams, or 300 milligrams. Since the 300-milligram dose is higher than the maximum recommended dose, this article will not focus on those results. The average age of people in the trial was about 36, more than half were females (59.3%), and about 80% were White. After taking the medicine for 12 weeks, people took surveys (called the Epworth Sleepiness Scale ). It asked them eight questions to find out how sleepy they felt and assigned a score based on their response. The highest score was 24, which meant they felt very sleepy. They also did a sleep study (called a Maintenance of Wakefulness Test or MWT test) that measured how long they could stay awake during the day in a dark and quiet room. After 12 weeks of treatment, the study reported the following results:"
