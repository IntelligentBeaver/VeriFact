        "Nov. 10, 2023 -- The FDA on Thursday approved the first vaccine for the chikungunya virus, which is transmitted to humans through mosquito bites.",
        "The vaccine, called Ixchiq and produced by Valneva Austria GmbH, is given in a single dose to people over 18 who are at increased risk of exposure to the virus. The safety of the vaccine was determined through two clinical studies involving about 3,500 adults. Common side effects included headache , fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, fever, nausea , and tenderness where the needle went in the skin.",
        "Severe reactions that prevented daily activity or required medical intervention occurred in 1.6% of vaccine recipients, the FDA said in a statement announcing the approval. Two people who received the vaccine had to be hospitalized.",
        "Chikungunya is “an emerging global health threat” and at least 5 million cases have been reported in the last 15 years, the FDA said. The highest risk of infection is in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and parts of the Americas."
