        "Researchers are still figuring out what causes MF, but there may be certain factors that increase your risk. One is a family of proteins called Janus kinases (JAKs). They send signals that impact how your body makes blood cells inside your bone marrow. And they work to control how many red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets you have. When JAKs are doing their job right, they help your body make the correct number of blood cells. But if these proteins send too many signals, it leads to too many blood cells in your bone marrow. When a mutated and overactive blood stem cell divides and makes copies of itself, it grows out of control. The result is the formation of many abnormal cells that make platelets (called megakaryocytes) in the bone marrow. These abnormal cells can change the bone marrow by releasing signaling proteins that help control inflammation in your body (called cytokines). Some scientists think this might trigger the buildup of fibrous tissue in your bone marrow, which then thickens, resembling scar tissue. It eventually hinders the bone marrow from making normal blood cells, leading to MF symptoms and other health problems."
