        "Dry eye disease is a condition that occurs when your eyes do not make enough tears or when your tears dry up too quickly. Tears are essential for keeping the surface of your eyes healthy, comfortable, and clear. Common symptoms of dry eye disease include a scratchy or gritty feeling, stinging, burning, redness, blurry vision , or sensitivity to light.",
        "Many things can cause dry eye symptoms or make them worse. For example, if environmental factors are to blame, changes like avoiding dry air, limiting screen time, and drinking more water may help. Many people also find relief with over-the-counter (OTC) eye drops , also called artificial tears , which help keep the eyes wet. When these basic measures are not enough, your eyes may need help producing more natural tears.",
        "In May 2025 , the FDA approved Tryptyr , a new medicine for dry eye disease. This article covers frequently asked questions and answers about Tryptyr for dry eye."

        "Tryptyr (acoltremon) 0.003% ophthalmic solution is a prescription eye drop for adults with dry eye disease. The medicine works by stimulating your eye’s natural tear production.",
        "The active ingredient in Tryptyr is acoltremon, which activates a protein in your eye called TRPM8. TRPM8 is part of a group of proteins in your eye called thermoreceptors, which detect small changes in temperature due to normal tear evaporation. When TRPM8 is activated, it stimulates nerves in your eye that help increase the amount of tears your eye makes on a daily basis. Making more tears can reduce symptoms of dry eye."

To be eligible for the studies, participants had to have both signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, confirmed through eye exams and special tests . Symptoms included a Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) score of at least 50 and an Ocular Discomfort Score of at least 50.
