        "No, and that’s a hard no, says Meena B. Bansal, MD, FAASLD, the system chief of Division of Liver Diseases at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. “There’s no such thing as a liver cleanse,” she says. “It doesn’t exist, and if you take them, there’s a good chance that what you’re doing is unhealthy or dangerous.”",
        "The liver, she says, is an organ that already removes toxins and waste from your body, clearing them by breaking them down and excreting them via your urine or feces. It’s a long, multistep process that starts with filtration of the blood and ends in the toilet."
