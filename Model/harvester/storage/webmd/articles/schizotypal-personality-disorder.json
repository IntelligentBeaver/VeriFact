They often feel anxious in social situations, have trouble forming close relationships, and may misinterpret reality, like mistaking sounds for voices.",

Medications, such as antipsychotics or antidepressants , may be used to address related issues like anxiety or depression.

People motivated to change, get treatment, and stick with it have better results."
