        "Evrysdi , also known as risdiplam, is an oral medicine used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in children and adults.  SMA is a genetic disease that is passed down through families. It leads to muscle weakness. Muscle weakness may affect normal everyday functions like head movement, sitting without help, walking, swallowing, or breathing. SMA is divided into types based on when symptoms appear. It may be called infantile if the symptoms first appear in infants, juvenile if symptoms first appear in children, or adult-onset, if symptoms first appear in adults.",
