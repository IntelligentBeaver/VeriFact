Understanding common food allergy triggers is crucial for individuals with allergies and those who care for them. In this post, I’ll explore the top nine food allergens and shed light on dangerous additives, artificial sweeteners, and food dyes that can potentially trigger allergic reactions.",
        "At 9 months old, our daughter was diagnosed with allergies to the top eight most common food allergies. Sesame became the ninth major food allergen through the Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research (FASTER) Act, a federal law passed in 2021. Although our daughter hasn’t officially been tested for sesame, we have not seen any reactions to it thus far.",
        "We’ve worked to ensure that her triggers are avoided and that she is retested annually to determine whether these allergens can be safely reintroduced into her diet. We didn’t realize that aside from her triggers, items like additives and food dyes should also be closely monitored."

        "Top 9 Food Allergens",
        "In the U.S., the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) identifies nine foods as major food allergens: milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, sesame, and soybeans. These foods account for 90% of all serious allergic reactions like anaphylaxis.",
        "Other countries identify allergens based on their rate of prominence, which means they may differ from what is identified here. In countries like Europe, New Zealand, Australia, and Taiwan, items like mustard, celery, lupin, mangoes, and royal jelly are among the top food allergens. This is an important thing to understand when traveling with food allergies.",
        "Dangerous Synthetic Food Additives",
        "There are over 3,000 food additives available for use in the U.S.",
        "While food allergies are mainly triggered by natural proteins, certain artificial additives can also cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. Artificial (synthetic) additives are completely chemically manufactured. When managing food allergies, it is crucial to understand the additives’ roles and how they are listed on food labels."
