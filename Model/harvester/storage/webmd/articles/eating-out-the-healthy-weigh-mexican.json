        "The food police -- otherwise knows as The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) -- are at it again. This time they tackled another of American's favorite foods, Mexican cuisine. Consider this: CSPI sent some of the menu items from the new Chipotle fast food restaurant chain off to a laboratory for analysis since the calories were not available from the company. The results might make you hotter than jalapeÃ±o salsa! A typical chicken burrito from Chipotle registered approximately 1,000 calories, the vegetarian burrito was 1,120 calories, and the pork came in at 1,130 calories!",
        "Mexican food by nature can be a trap for calories, fat, and sodium. The fried tortilla chips, high-fat meats, sour cream, cheese, guacamole, refried beans, and deep-fried combo dishes can really pack on the pounds. So what's a hungry Mexican food lover to do? Don't despair, we've got tips on how to identify the healthier choices at your local Mexican restaurants and fast food chains that qualify for a WLC eating plan."
