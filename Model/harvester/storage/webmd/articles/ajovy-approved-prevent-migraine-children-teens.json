        "Ajovy (fremanezumab) is a medicine approved to help prevent migraines. It is a lab-made monoclonal antibody that blocks a protein called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), known to play a role in causing migraine attacks. Ajovy was approved in 2018 for adults, and now, the FDA has approved it for children as young as 6 years old who weigh at least 99 pounds (45 kilograms).",
        "Ajovy is the first CGRP-blocking medicine approved for children and teens, helping prevent episodic migraines by targeting their root cause instead of relieving symptoms only.",
        "Migraine affects about 5% of children aged 5-10 and about 15% of adolescents. It can cause episodes of severe pain, nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. For kids and teens, migraine can make it hard to go to school, keep up with studies, spend time with friends, or enjoy daily life.",
        "Why Was It Approved?",
        "The FDA approved Ajovy based on results from a study showing that it was safe and effective in preventing episodic migraines in children and teens. In the study, children who took Ajovy for over three months had fewer migraine and headache days — about 2.5 days fewer each month compared to 1.4 days with placebo. Nearly half of the children taking Ajovy saw their migraine days reduced by half or more, while only about 1 in 4 children taking placebo had the same result. The results were similar across age groups and for both boys and girls."
