        "Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women in the United States. Each year, approximately 30% of newly diagnosed cancers in women are breast cancer. There are many treatments available for breast cancer. The type of treatment depends on the type of breast cancer you have.",
        "Breast cancer that grows and spreads in the presence of the hormone estrogen is known as estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive cancer . In about 20% of breast cancers, cancer cells may also have a lot of growth of a protein known as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2-positive breast cancers tend to spread more quickly than HER2-negative breast cancers. Some people with ER-positive cancer can also have a specific gene mutation known as the estrogen receptor-1 (ESR1) mutation. This mutation can make certain treatments, such as some types of hormone therapy , not work as well.",
        "In ER-positive breast cancer, hormone therapy is often used after surgery to lower the chance of cancer coming back. Sometimes, hormone therapy is started before surgery. There are several types of hormone therapy available to treat breast cancer. One type is selective estrogen receptor degraders ( SERDs ). SERDs are most often used in people who have gone through menopause . If used before menopause, SERDs are given along with another medicine that shuts down the ovaries.",
        "When treating ER-positive breast cancer, hormone therapy can sometimes be given with targeted drug therapies that block certain cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), known as CDK 4/6 inhibitors. Examples of CDK 4/6 inhibitors include abemaciclib , palbociclib , and ribociclib ."
