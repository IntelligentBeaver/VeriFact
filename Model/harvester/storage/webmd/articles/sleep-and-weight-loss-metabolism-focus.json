        "A 2023 study by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh showed that people with good sleep habits were more likely than those with poor sleep habits to stick to exercise and diet plans while trying to manage weight. And it’s not just about reducing nighttime snacking. Research shows that sleep affects the drivers of hunger and cravings, as well as metabolism and the ability to make healthy choices in general.",
        "In this webinar, the director of the Sleep and Health Research Program at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Michael Grandner, PhD, will talk about that study and other research findings regarding sleep and healthy habit building. He will explain how sleep is connected with the weight management strategies we adopt and how we can improve our sleep habits to power various changes in our lives."
