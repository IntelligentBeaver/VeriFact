It can feel sharp and stabbing, and medication usually won’t help. Some women say it feels like their insides are being pulled down. They have a gnawing or throbbing feeling that can be severe. Backache. Your uterus and ovaries are near your back. Belly pain that makes you hunch over can hurt your back, too. Leg pain . Endometriosis can affect nerves that connect to your groin, hips, and legs. This can make it hard to walk. You may limp or have to rest often. Painful sex . Many women with endometriosis feel pain while having sex or up to 2 days later. For some, it feels stabbing or sharp. Others describe it as an ache in their pelvic area. Painful bowel movements . Depending on the affected areas, it might hurt to poop."
