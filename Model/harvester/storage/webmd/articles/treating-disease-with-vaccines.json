        "Standard preventative vaccines work by helping your immune system develop immunity to a weakened or dead form of a germ. Then, when you actually come into contact with the live germ, your immune system knows how to fight it off.",
        "Therapeutic vaccines would be used after a person contracts a disease, yet they would still work by boosting your own immune system's response to an illness.",
        "While the immune system works very well most of the time, some illnesses -- like cancer , HIV , and Alzheimer's -- don't trigger an effective immune response. In the case of some cancers, the immune system simply fails to recognize the invading cells. Other viruses, like HIV, can overwhelm the immune system and shut it down before it can work.",

      "bullets": [
        "Antigen vaccines. When an antigen is introduced into the body, it provokes the immune system to create an antibody to fight it. Some researchers are working on vaccines that will use specific cancer antigens to force the immune system into action.",
        "Dendritic cell vaccines. Dendritic cells are immune cells which prowl your bloodstream, grabbing foreign germs and bringing them to other immune cells, which create antibodies to attack them. Researchers have had some success in removing dendritic cells from a person, \"loading\" them with dead tumor cells or dead viruses, and then injecting them back into the person. Once the dendritic cells have been \"taught\" how to recognize the invading cells, they may spur the immune system to attack.",
        "DNA vaccines. One problem with many therapeutic vaccines is that the effects wear off. After a vaccination, the immune system might be aggressive for awhile, but eventually return to normal. Some researchers hope they can inject bits of DNA into cells, instructing them to keep the immune system revved up and alert.",
        "Tumor cell vaccines. These vaccines use actual cancer cells that are removed during surgery. The cells are then killed -- so they can't cause cancer growth -- and tweaked in some way, often by adding new genes or chemicals. They are then introduced into the body. The hope is that the modified gene will get the attention of the immune system, which will then target other cancer cells. Some of these vaccines are autologous (using cancer cells from your own body), others are allogeneic (using cells that came from someone else)."

One approach had researchers loading dendritic cells with killed AIDS viruses and then injecting them back into the person, triggering an effective immune response. In one 2004 study of 18 people injected with the vaccine, the amount of virus in the blood dropped by 80%. After one year, eight of the people still had a 90% drop in their viral levels.",

By getting the immune system to attack the protein, the vaccine might slow down the progress of the illness. A study of the vaccine was suspended in 2002, when 6% of the subjects developed brain inflammation. However, researchers kept tracking the people who received the vaccines. After a year, about 20% of the people were making antibodies to the protein, meaning that their immune system was attacking it. This group also scored slightly better on memory tests than people who had not received the vaccine.",
        "Cancer. A cancer vaccine has been the Holy Grail for many immunologists, and dozens of vaccines have been tested in dozens of types of cancer. Vaccines are being developed for breast cancer , colorectal cancer , kidney cancer , leukemia , lung cancer , lymphoma , melanoma , ovarian cancer , prostate cancer , and pancreatic cancer , among others. One prostate cancer vaccine, Provenge, was shown to lengthen the life of men with widespread disease. It also is a dendritic vaccine -- dendritic cells are taken from a man, \"taught\" to recognize tumor cells, and reinjected into the body. In a group of 127 men with metastatic prostate cancer, the men who received the vaccine lived four and a half months longer than the men who didn't. One vaccine that will help prevent cervical cancer , Gardasil, is likely to be approved by the FDA soon. Studies show that Gardasil will block the underlying cause of 70% of all cervical cancers. Another similar HPV vaccine , Cervarix, is also in the pipeline. However, these aren't truly therapeutic vaccines -- they work by preventing infection with a virus (HPV or human papillomavirus) that can lead to cervical cancer."

            "Cancer. A cancer vaccine has been the Holy Grail for many immunologists, and dozens of vaccines have been tested in dozens of types of cancer. Vaccines are being developed for breast cancer , colorectal cancer , kidney cancer , leukemia , lung cancer , lymphoma , melanoma , ovarian cancer , prostate cancer , and pancreatic cancer , among others. One prostate cancer vaccine, Provenge, was shown to lengthen the life of men with widespread disease. It also is a dendritic vaccine -- dendritic cells are taken from a man, \"taught\" to recognize tumor cells, and reinjected into the body. In a group of 127 men with metastatic prostate cancer, the men who received the vaccine lived four and a half months longer than the men who didn't. One vaccine that will help prevent cervical cancer , Gardasil, is likely to be approved by the FDA soon. Studies show that Gardasil will block the underlying cause of 70% of all cervical cancers. Another similar HPV vaccine , Cervarix, is also in the pipeline. However, these aren't truly therapeutic vaccines -- they work by preventing infection with a virus (HPV or human papillomavirus) that can lead to cervical cancer."
