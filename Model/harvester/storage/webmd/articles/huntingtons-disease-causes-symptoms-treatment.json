        "Huntington ’ s disease (HD) is a hereditary disorder that causes nerve cells in the brain to break down. Over time, this causes motor skills and thinking abilities (cognition) to decline and increases your risk for mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. Huntington ’ s can begin at any time, from childhood to much later in life. Symptoms most commonly appear when people are in their 30s or 40s. If the condition begins in childhood, adolescence, or anytime before the age of 20, it is called juvenile Huntington’s disease (JHD). JHD makes up about 5%-10% of all Huntington’s disease diagnoses.",
        "There is currently no cure for Huntington’s disease, and symptoms do worsen over time. But many treatments can lessen and help control symptoms. Also, there are many things you can do to live a better life with the condition.",
        "A diagnosis of Huntington ’ s disease can feel like a lot to handle, but tapping into a support system, such as a social worker, therapist, or support group, can help you deal with it better. With the help of a multidisciplinary (meaning different kinds of providers) health care team, people with Huntington ’ s can live independently for many years.",
