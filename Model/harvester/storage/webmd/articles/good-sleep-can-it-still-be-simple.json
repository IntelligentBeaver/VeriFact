        "Many people try herbal supplements to tame their insomnia. \"My patients come to me after they've tried valerian and chamomile tea,\" says Lorenzo. Some studies have suggested that valerian can help promote sleep, but it is not FDA-approved. Chamomile is commonly used and considered safe by the FDA.",
        "Melatonin has shown great promise, Lorenzo says. Melatonin is a hormone the body naturally produces at night and is thought to help initiate sleep. Melatonin supplements have been available in health food stores for quite awhile, but they are not FDA-approved, so their purity and safety are not known, she notes.",
        "A medication which works on the melatonin system, called Rozerem , was FDA-approved last year, Lorenzo tells WebMD. Rozerem works by stimulating the body's melatonin receptors. \"Clinical studies have shown that it helps with insomnia. Since it doesn't work at all like sleeping pills, we won't have any dependency issues.\"",
        "Research has shown that melatonin prompts brain neurons to regulate the biological clock, Twery says. \"The advantage of melatonin is that it comes from natural sources. Synthetic melatonin brings purity and better safety in terms of accurate dosage. That's a nice step forward. However, the research hasn't fully worked out details about long-term use of synthetic melatonin.\""
