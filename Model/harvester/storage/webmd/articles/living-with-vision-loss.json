After a visit to the ophthalmologist , her mother's diagnosis turned out to be age-related dry macular degeneration ( AMD ), a chronic, degenerative eye disease that causes central vision loss.",

Kleinman, MD, MBA, associate professor of ophthalmology at the Flaum Eye Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, in Rochester, N.Y. With AMD, light-sensitive cells in the macula (the area responsible for seeing fine detail when you look straight ahead) gradually begin to deteriorate and die.",
        "As the disease progresses, blind or blurry spots can appear in the center of your vision, making it difficult to read, drive, or even recognize faces. These blind spots can get bigger as the disease progresses. (Another form of the disease, wet AMD, is less common but often progresses more rapidly.) If you notice these signs, see an eye doctor for an exam."
