        "Microblading is a type of cosmetic tattoo. A technician draws eyebrow “hairs” with a special tool that has tiny needles on the end. They make fine cuts and fill them with color. The color usually lasts about a year. All tattoos fade over time -- it just happens faster with microblading. The procedure is generally considered safe and most people don’t have problems. But there are risks. Here’s what you need to know."
