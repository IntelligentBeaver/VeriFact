In a PET scan, you’re injected with a safe radioactive chemical called a radiotracer. After the radiotracer has had a chance to get into your bloodstream, cells, and tissues, you’ll lie on a moving table, similar to one for a CT scan. In places where your body has increased metabolic activity, more of the radiotracer is absorbed.
