        "When Steven O'Shea, 42, a Michigan landscaper, fell out of a tree, his chainsaw cut halfway through his forearm . The uninsured father of four received a $39,000 bill from the plastic surgeon who operated on him. Though grateful for the care, O'Shea says, \"I couldn't believe it. How was I going to pay a $39,000 bill?\"",
        "Christopher McCaughna, 50, of Seminole, Fla., lost his brother, Eric, at age 43 after a five-day hospitalization for a diabetic coma . Also uninsured, Eric left behind a $75,000 hospital bill, which his brother had to settle.",
        "Faced with such daunting charges, O'Shea and McCaughna turned to a private medical billing advocate to guide them through the paperwork thicket. Nora Johnson, with Medical Billing Advocates of America, scrutinized their bills for errors and negotiated reductions.",
        "Johnson is part of an emerging field of medical billing advocates across the country. Armed with knowledge of arcane and complex billing codes, they will help patients organize their debts, hunt for mistakes, and deal with insurers, health care providers, and collection agencies."
