Avmapki Fakzynja is combination of two different TKIs and is the first approved medicine used to treat recurrent low-grade serous KRAS-mutated ovarian cancer. Avmapki Fakzynja was approved as an accelerated approval and is currently recruiting patients for a clinical trial, NCT06072781.

        "Avmapki Fakzynja works by targeting certain proteins in the body called kinases, which cause cancer cells to grow out of control. It blocks two different kinases (MEK1 and FAK) on the cancer cells that help the cells to grow and divide. Avmapki blocks the MEK kinase and Fakzynja blocks the FAK kinase. By blocking these proteins, Avmapki Fakzynja helps shut off signals that cause abnormal ovarian cancer cell growth, which can slow or stop the growth of the tumor."

For example, if you take Avmapki on Mondays and Thursdays at 7 a.m., this is when you take it each week for the three of the four weeks. If you take Fakzynja at 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., you should take it at that time each day.  If you vomit your dose or miss your dose of Avmapki by more than 24 hours or your dose of Fakzynja by more than six hours, you should not take an extra dose to make up for the missed dose. You should take it at your regularly scheduled time the next day. You should not open, crush, chew, or dissolve capsules or tablets.",
