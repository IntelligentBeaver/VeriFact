        "Hib disease is an invasive bacterial infection that at one time was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in young children. Invasive means that germs spread to parts of the body that are normally germ-free. Meningitis is an infection of the membrane that covers the brain and spinal cord. Bacterial meningitis is a serious infection that can cause fever, decline in cognitive ability, coma , and death. It kills from 3% to 6% of the children who have it. And even when children survive, many of them are left with serious nerve and brain damage that can range from blindness to paralysis to intellectual disability.",
        "In addition to meningitis, Hib can cause pneumonia ; epiglottitis, which is an infection in the throat that can cause breathing difficulties; blood infection ; bone infection; and joint infection leading to arthritis.",
        "The Hib germ is spread in droplets that come from sneezing or coughing . Before use of the vaccine , there were about 20,000 cases of Hib disease each year in children under age 5 -- 12,000 of which were meningitis -- and about 1,000 deaths per year."
