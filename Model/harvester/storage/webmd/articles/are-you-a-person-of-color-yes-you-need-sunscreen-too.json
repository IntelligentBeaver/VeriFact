        "Sunscreen is a crucial component of any skin care routine, regardless of your skin tone. However, for people with skin of color (SOC), finding the right sunscreen that blends well and won’t leave a chalky white residue can be a challenge. Let’s break down the importance of sunscreen, what it is, and how to choose the right one if you have skin of color.",
        "First off, what is sunscreen? Sunscreen is a product that you apply directly to the skin to help protect against ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun. Be sure to select a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. And use one that covers both UVA and UVB wavelengths – it will say “broad spectrum” on the bottle.",
        "Sunscreen is a must in everyone’s skin care routine, regardless of skin tone and complexion. Despite common misconceptions, people with skin of color are not immune to the harmful effects of UV radiation from the sun. While darker skin tones naturally have more melanin, which provides a degree of built-in sun protection, it's not enough to completely shield the skin from damage. Even the darkest skin complexion only has a natural SPF of 14, which is much less than the recommended 30. Without proper protection, individuals with darker skin tones are still at risk of sun damage."

        "Sunscreen benefits everyone by helping to reduce damage to our cells from the sun’s radiation, which can lead to skin cancers as well as premature aging, skin thinning, collagen loss, and pigmentary changes. For darker skin types, hyperpigmentation can occur, and this can be difficult to treat. Therefore, incorporating sunscreen into your daily skin care routine is essential for maintaining healthy and radiant skin.",
        "If you do not apply sunscreen and are spending time outdoors, your skin will burn. This happens more quickly for people with lighter skin, but essentially all skin types can burn with enough sun exposure. A sunburn results in redness of the skin, pain, and swelling and ultimately can cause the skin to peel and slough off in the immediate future. Long-term, sun damage causes premature aging and damage to the nuclear DNA in our cells, which can lead to skin cancers. And yes, everyone can get skin cancer, regardless of your skin color!",

        "If you are a person with skin of color, be sure to look for a sunscreen that has an SPF rating of at least 30 or higher and that says it’s broad spectrum. This means that it covers UVA and UVB wavelengths from the sun. If you plan to be sweating or swimming, a water-resistant sunscreen is a great choice, as it won’t rub off so easily and run into your eyes.",
        "All sunscreens need to be reapplied every 2 hours, though. People with darker skin can use mineral- or chemical-based sunscreens based on their personal preference. However, some mineral-based sunscreens can leave a chalky white residue, so be sure to try it out on your skin first. One workaround for this is to use a tinted sunscreen or to add a bit of foundation to your sunscreen for a more natural finish based on your skin color. Tinted sunscreens can work nicely for darker skin types, especially with mineral-based sunscreens. The tint helps the sunscreen blend more naturally. In addition, the iron oxide in tinted sunscreens can help prevent hyperpigmentation from visual light, which can be a common concern in darker skin types.",

No matter your skin color, remember to choose sunscreens that provide broad-spectrum protection, are lightweight and moisturizing, and feel good on you to keep your skin protected all year round.",
