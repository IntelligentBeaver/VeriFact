        "Muscular dystrophy is a group of diseases that make muscles weaker and less flexible over time. It is caused by a problem in the genes that control how the body keeps muscles healthy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common form of muscular dystrophy. DMD mainly affects boys, and symptoms usually start between the ages of 3 and 5 years. DMD slowly gets worse over time and affects muscles used for movement, breathing, and heart function.",
        "Health care providers can prescribe Amondys 45 ( casimersen ) for people with DMD who have a gene mutation that can be treated by skipping a certain section of genetic code called exon 45. Amondys 45 is the first targeted treatment for this type of mutation and has been shown to help increase the production of a muscle protein called dystrophin."

Regular hand washing is your best strategy to keep from getting sick. You should also minimize contact with people who have colds. If you are looking for relief from the symptoms of a cold, fever, or the flu, there are many over-the-counter (OTC) options at your local pharmacy. Two common types of pain relievers are acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Most OTC pain relief medicines contain one or the other.
