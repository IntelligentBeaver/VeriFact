        "When most people hear the word tumor, their next thought is cancer. But they’re not always the same thing. You get a tumor when instead of growing in their usual, orderly way, a group of cells starts to grow out of control. They form a mass that normally wouldn’t be there, and that mass may or may not be cancer.",
        "If you have an adrenal gland adenoma, you have a tumor on your adrenal gland, but it’s not cancer . Your two adrenal glands , one on each kidney , make hormones. Hormones are like messengers that scoot around your body and tell your organs what to do -- from how to handle stress to controlling blood sugar levels .",
        "Most adrenal gland adenomas don’t cause any problems -- they just take up space. But some of them are functioning tumors; they make the same hormones as your adrenal glands. The extra hormones from the tumor can lead to several conditions, such as Cushing’s syndrome. Typically, surgery and medicine can successfully treat the symptoms."
