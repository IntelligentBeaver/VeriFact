        "A topical therapy is any psoriasis treatment that’s put on the skin. Absorption into the bloodstream and other effects to your body are minimal. Common topical treatments include: Corticosteroids (such as hydrocortisone, fluocinonide, or triamcinolone), moisturizers, anthralin, calcipotriene, calcitriol , coal tar, tacrolimus , and tazarotene Nonsteroidal topical treatments such as r oflumilast (Zoryve) and tapinarof (Vtama) Ultraviolet light (phototherapy) that focuses only on the affected areas of skin Systemic treatments, working on the entire body, often act on the immune system to ease psoriasis over large areas of the body. These treat moderate to severe psoriasis. Advanced psoriasis treatments include: Oral medications (pills) like acitretin (Soriatane), apremilast (Otezla), cyclosporine , d eucravacitinib (Sotyktu), and methotrexate Biologic therapies include adalimumab (Humira), bimikizumab (Bimzelx), brodalumab (Siliq), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), guselkumab (Tremfya), infliximab (Remicade), ixekizumab (Taltz), secukinumab (Cosentyx), and ustekinumab (Stelara). These are injectable drugs. Phototherapy, or ultraviolet light treatment to the whole body While systemic treatments are far more effective than topicals, they can have more side effects. They're also more expensive."

        "If you're thinking about systemic treatment, think about how severe your psoriasis is. Doctors divide people with psoriasis according to how much skin is affected: Mild to moderate or limited psoriasis: Less than 3% of total body surface is affected. (For reference, the palm of the hand is about 1% of your body area.) Moderate psoriasis: 3% to 10% of your body surface has it. Severe psoriasis: More than 10% is affected. A doctor's rule of thumb: Topical therapies can help limited psoriasis. For moderate to severe psoriasis, putting topical creams on all the skin that's affected may be unrealistic. Most doctors recommend systemic treatment in that case. Doctors also often recommend that people still use topical creams, solutions, or ointments while taking systemic treatments. The combination leads to better results than either treatment used alone."
