Breaking down the data by race and ethnicity, older Black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander people visited the hospital with RSV-related illnesses less often or around the same rate as their overall populations. But these groups (except for Asian/Pacific Islander people) were more likely to go to the hospital at a younger age than White people.
