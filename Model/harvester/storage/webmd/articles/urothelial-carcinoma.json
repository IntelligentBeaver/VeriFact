        "Urothelial carcinoma is cancer of the urinary system. The urothelium is a kind of epithelial (protective) lining of the urinary system, which includes the urinary tract, bladder, your ureters (the tubes that connect your kidneys to your bladder) and the part of your kidneys that hold urine. The urothelium’s job is to keep your urine from coming in contact with other parts of your body. Carcinoma is the word for cancer that starts in epithelial cells, and it is the most common type of cancer.",
        "Urothelial carcinoma is also called transitional cell carcinoma because the cells in the urothelium can transition between different shapes to enable the bladder to stretch and shrink as needed.",
        "Is urothelial cancer the same as bladder cancer ?",
        "Urothelial carcinoma is responsible for 90% of bladder cancer cases. But there are some types of bladder cancer that have different causes, and urothelial carcinoma can also be kidney cancer. Both bladder and kidney cancer are highly treatable when they are caught early.",

        "Most urothelial carcinoma stays in the lining of the bladder. There are different types of urothelial carcinoma based on how the cancer grows and where it goes.",
        "Invasive vs. noninvasive urothelial carcinoma. Also called non-muscle invasive, noninvasive urothelial carcinoma grows only in the urothelium. Three-fourths of newly diagnosed bladder cancers are noninvasive. Invasive urothelial carcinoma has spread beyond the bladder lining into the muscle of the bladder.",
        "High-grade vs. low-grade urothelial carcinoma. “Grade is determined by the pathologist,” says Adam Weiner, MD, a urologic surgeon at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. “The surgeon removes some of the tumor in the operating room using a camera in the bladder. The pathologist looks under a microscope and they can tell based on the size of the cells and some other characteristics that tell them how quickly the cells are dividing.”",
        "In low-grade urothelial carcinoma, the cancer cells look more like the normal cells of the endothelium. They tend to grow slowly and stay within the lining of the bladder. High-grade urothelial carcinoma means the cells look different from normal cells. They tend to grow more quickly and are more likely to spread into the muscle and beyond.",
        "Flat vs. papillary urothelial carcinoma. Flat urothelial carcinoma is made up of flat cancer cells that sit flush with the bladder wall and are unlikely to become invasive but are likely to come back after treatment. It is also known as carcinoma in situ. In papillary urothelial carcinoma, the cancer cells grow into the space of the bladder in shapes that are described as finger- or mushroom -like. Papillary bladder cancer can be low-grade, high-grade, invasive, or noninvasive. Low-grade, noninvasive papillary urothelial carcinoma is unlikely to return after treatment."

          "text": "There are different levels of surgery to treat bladder cancer that depend on the stage and grade of the cancer. For non-muscle invasive low-grade urothelial carcinoma, providers can usually remove the tumor with a procedure called transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). The tumor is essentially scraped (and sometimes burned off) from the bladder lining. It can be combined with chemotherapy in the bladder to lessen the likelihood of recurrence. Patients are monitored on a regular basis going forward so that any recurrence can be caught and removed.",

Smoking and being exposed to certain industrial chemicals significantly increase the risk of bladder cancer, which also is more common in men. New advances in immunotherapy are really good news for people who are diagnosed with urothelial cancer.",
