        "Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) is a group of genetic conditions that affect the nervous system and skin. AHP causes painful and sometimes life-threatening attacks of symptoms. It's part of a group of eight inherited disorders called porphyrias. Porphyrias are very rare. Only about 5 out of every 100,000 people have these conditions. Some people with AHP have few to no symptoms or problems. Others have frequent, severe attacks throughout their lifetime. These attacks can affect every part of your life, including your job and relationships. But there are treatments to manage them."

        "Hepatic refers to the liver. In AHP, the enzyme you need to make heme is missing from your liver. Because your body can't make heme, other substances that would normally go into making heme aren't used. These substances, including porphobilinogen and aminolevulinic acid, are toxic. They build up in your liver. Then they travel through your bloodstream and damage your nerves. The nerve damage leads to attacks of pain, numbness, nausea, skin changes, and other symptoms. Symptoms vary from person to person depending on which parts of the body AHP affects. Most people have only a few attacks during their lifetime. Around 1 in 10 people have at least four attacks per year. Some attacks are severe enough to need treatment in a hospital. AHP can be life-threatening."

Certain infections can set off symptoms, including: Hepatitis C HIV Urinary tract infections (UTIs) Pneumonia Shingles Staying up to date on your vaccines can help you avoid these and other infections. When you're sick, it's important to treat both the infection and the AHP attack. Extreme diets. Fasting or eating a very low-calorie or low-carbohydrate diet can lead to attacks. Obesity might also contribute to symptoms. When it comes to eating, moderation is key. No foods are off-limits, but things like broiled meat, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage in large amounts might increase porphyrin production. A dietitian can help you figure out which foods might be causing your symptoms. Smoking. Along with its other health risks, smoking boosts the amount of toxic heme ingredients in your blood. If you smoke, ask your doctor for advice on how to quit."
