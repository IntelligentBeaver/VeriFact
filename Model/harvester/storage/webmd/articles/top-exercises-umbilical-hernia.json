        "An umbilical hernia is a condition where your internal organs bulge through a gap in your abdominal wall near your belly button. This condition can have both aesthetic and health consequences. In children, it may resolve by age 2 or 3, but if not then it often requires surgery . For adults, surgery is often required , and gentle exercise helps during recovery.",
        "Umbilical hernias in adults are generally caused by high amounts of pressure in the abdomen. Things like straining during a workout, pregnancy , and weight gain can all lead to umbilical hernias. Whether or not surgery is used to correct the umbilical hernia, gentle exercise can help prevent the hernia from coming back."

        "Deep breathing helps avoid these problems. You don’t need to make every breath a deep inhalation. However, taking deep, full breaths several times a day can help keep mucus out of your lungs. You can also cough carefully while holding a pillow over your abdomen to help support the hernia.",

Walking helps your organs return to their proper place. It also gets your heart pumping, bringing blood to your surgery site, which helps your body heal. Walk slowly, and don’t hesitate to sit down if you feel unstable. You can also climb stairs, taking them slowly and one at a time."
