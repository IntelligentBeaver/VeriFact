        "Nov. 22, 2024 – On Dec. 9, 1965, a TV holiday special called A Charlie Brown Christmas made its debut on CBS and introduced the world to a mental health topic that rarely if ever got discussed between therapists and their patients.",
        "“I think there must be something wrong with me, Linus,” Charlie admitted to his friend. “Christmas is coming, but I’m not happy. I don’t feel the way I’m supposed to feel.”",
        "It wasn’t just holiday blues that were giving Charlie Brown a sense of vague melancholy. The animated kid may have had what we now describe as seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, a form of clinical depression that usually strikes during the darker, colder winter months. At least 11 million people in the U. S. alone struggle with SAD, though the actual number could be far higher because it’s so infrequently diagnosed or treated.",
        "A compelling study published earlier this year in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science was described by one of its co-authors as a “call to arms,” encouraging professional peers to dig deeper into the influence of seasons on human psychology. The study cast a broad net across research over the last few decades to find out “what’s out there, and what do we actually know ,” said the co-author, Michael Varnum, PhD, an associate professor of psychology at the relatively warm and sunny Arizona State University. “We found some stuff that was really surprising.”"

Analyzing responses from more than 230,000 Americans over a decade, they found that values like group cohesion and conformity tend to be stronger during the autumn and spring months. “Psychology is a relatively young field,” O’Shea said. “Researchers are more motivated to test whether seasonal impacts on human behaviors are simply folk myths or valuable cultural wisdom.”",

It may be as simple as realizing, as Varnum notes, that “at certain times of year, we’re going to feel a bit more anxious and depressed.” But that’s still a huge leap forward from how SAD has traditionally been treated. (When Lucy Van Pelt first offered “Psychiatric Help 5¢” to a depressed Charlie Brown, her advice was “Snap out of it!” And in A Charlie Brown Christmas , she told him she understood his “getting depressed and all that,” because she never gets what she really wants for Christmas: “Real estate.”)",

But then find a reason to go outside anyway, and let your mind get blown by how breathtakingly beautiful winter can be.”",

        "For some, finding peace with SAD might mean not forcing themselves to go outside, but redefining their behavior during the winter months. As some researchers have noted , seasonal affective disorder has more than a few parallels to hibernation. For many animals – salmon, wolves, bears – seasonal patterns are part of their biology. These patterns impact mating, migration, and physiological changes. “It turns out, if you’re talking about people, that’s probably pretty important too,” said Varnum.",
        "In other words, we don’t look at hibernating bears and think, “They get super depressed and antisocial during the winter.” So why are humans held to a different standard? “I think a lot of this comes from misguided ideas that we should have the same level of energy, motivation, and productivity year-round,” Leibowitz said. “Despite the fact that every other living thing on earth, plant or animal, changes its behavior and rests more in winter.”",
