        "Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) and Ocrevus Zunovo (ocrelizumab/hyaluronidase-ocsq) are prescription medicines for multiple sclerosis (MS) . Both of these products contain the medicine ocrelizumab, which is a protein substance made in the lab for human use ( monoclonal antibody ). Ocrevus and Ocrevus Zunovo help to slow down MS by aiming at specific cells in the immune system that cause it. The FDA approved Ocrevus in 2017 to treat adults with relapsing (returning) forms of MS or primary progressive MS. Ocrevus Zunovo was approved in 2024 to treat the same forms of MS as Ocrevus. Ocrevus was the first medicine approved for primary progressive MS. A health care provider injects it into a vein (intravenous infusion) at a clinic or at home. Ocrevus is given three times during the first year and then twice a year. Ocrevus Zunovo is the first medicine approved for people with relapsing or progressive MS that is given under the skin (subcutaneous) twice a year."

        "MS happens when your immune system damages the protective covering around the nerves in your brain, called myelin . This affects how your brain communicates with other parts of your body. A group of immune cells called B cells is believed to be the main cause of MS by involving other immune cells, like T cells, causing myelin damage. Ocrevus is thought to work by targeting these B cells and making them destroy themselves, though exactly how Ocrevus does this is not fully known yet. Ocrevus Zunovo contains the same medicine as Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) and works the same way to treat MS. However, Ocrevus Zunovo also contains hyaluronidase. Hyaluronidase helps the body absorb the medicine when it is given as an injection under the skin."
