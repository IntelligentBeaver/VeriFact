        "Progesterone helps control your period, too. Generally, progesterone levels go up each month when you ovulate and your body is ready to get pregnant . If you don’t get pregnant, progesterone goes back down and triggers your period. If you get pregnant , progesterone will keep going up. In pregnancy, progesterone is about 10 times its normal level.",
