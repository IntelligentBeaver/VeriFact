It’s possible that people who age well are wired for optimism and blessed with great genes. But there are also secrets to aging well, no matter what your health or life circumstances. You have more control over your physical and emotional destiny than you may think."

        "There’s a reason doctors suggest exercise for just about every health concern. It may well be the only treatment that can reduce your risk of age-related disease, improve quality of life, and increase life span . Among its many benefits, regular exercise can: Lower the risk of heart disease Lower blood pressure Help control blood sugar Improve strength and balance Fight off depression Help your brain stay sharp Help you get good sleep Most people, including older adults, should aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise on most days (2½ hours per week total). If you aren’t interested in traditional exercise (cycling, swimming, elliptical machines), that’s OK. Take the stairs more often, mow the lawn, walk your dog, or march in place while watching TV."

        "It’s a common weight loss story: You try a new diet, lose some weight, gain the weight back -- and then repeat the cycle with other diets. Doctors call this “ weight cycling, ” and it isn’t great for your mind or body. Several studies link weight cycling with depression symptoms. Other research suggests it may boost your risk of diseases in your heart and blood vessels and type 2 diabetes. Instead of dieting, try mindful eating. Get in the habit of thinking about everything you eat or drink. It can help you make healthy choices that support your overall health. Some loose guidelines: Start with your doctor. Everyone’s health is different, so you may need a diet with limited salt, increased fiber , or fewer calories overall. Take time to plan meals and snacks. Fill up on healthy foods, like fruit, veggies, proteins, and whole grains. Drink water, even if you’re not thirsty. It helps your kidneys flush toxins from your body, among other health benefits. Enjoy your favorite foods. Don’t deny yourself chips, chocolate, pizza or other indulgences. Just enjoy them in moderate portions (premeasured if it helps) once in a while. Cut back on alcohol. It can dehydrate you, stop your mediations from working the way they should, and raise your odds of health conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, and even sexually transmitted diseases. It also raises your risk of injury from falling."
