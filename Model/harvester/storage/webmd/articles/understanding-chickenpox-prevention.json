        "The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children be immunized with the varicella zoster vaccine to prevent chickenpox at 12-15 months and a second dose between ages 4-6 for complete protection. An option is the MMRV vaccine, which may be given to children 12 months through 12 years of age, in two doses. The vaccine combines measles, mumps, rubella and varicella and provides lifelong immunity.",
        "The vaccine is also a protection to vulnerable people, such as non-immune women who plan to become pregnant. Some, such as those who are already pregnant, are not eligible to receive the chickenpox vaccine . Consult your doctor for advice.",
        "A similar vaccine -- but in a higher dose -- is also available for the elderly who already had chickenpox to prevent painful outbreaks of shingles. Those over 65 can consult their doctors to see if this higher dose vaccine may help them."
