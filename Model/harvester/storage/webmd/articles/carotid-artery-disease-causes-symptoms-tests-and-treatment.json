That could indicate carotid artery disease.",

Some experts believe that bruits may be better predictors of atherosclerotic disease rather than risk of stroke. Be sure to let your doctor know if you have had any symptoms, such as those listed above.",

        "Carotid ultrasound (standard or Doppler). This non-invasive, painless screening test uses high-frequency sound waves to view the carotid arteries.

Ultrasound imaging does not use X-rays.",
        "Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This imaging technique uses a powerful magnet to gather accurate information about the brain and arteries. Then a computer uses this information to generate high-resolution images. An MRA can often detect even small strokes in the brain.",
        "Computerized tomography angiography (CTA). More detailed than an X-ray, a CT uses X-rays and computer technology to produce cross-sectional images of the carotid arteries. Images of the brain can be collected as well. With this imaging test, the scan may reveal areas of damage on the brain. The CT scan uses a low level of radiation .",
        "Cerebral angiography (carotid angiogram). This procedure is considered the gold standard for imaging the carotid arteries. It is an invasive procedure that lets a doctor see blood flow through the carotid arteries in real-time. Cerebral angiography allows the doctor to see narrowing or blockages on a live X-ray screen as contrast dye is injected into the carotid arteries. This procedure provides the best information. It does carry a small risk of serious complications."
