        "These two numbers show how hard your heart works to pump blood throughout your body and how much pressure it puts on your blood vessels. If one or both numbers consistently stay too high, it's called hypertension. It can damage your organs over time and lead to serious health problems.",
        "The difference between systolic pressure and diastolic pressure is that they reflect two different forces during one heartbeat:",
        "Systolic pressure. This is the force against your arteries as your heart squeezes to pump out blood. It's a snapshot of how hard your heart is pumping at that moment",
        "Diastolic pressure . This is the pressure in your arteries as your heart rests and fills with blood to get ready for the next heartbeat.",
        "A healthy balance between your systolic and diastolic pressure helps ease the strain on your heart.",
        "Checking your blood pressure at home helps you keep track of your blood pressure numbers. If either number is too high, it might mean you have hypertension, a condition that can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. (Photo credit: E+/Getty Images)"
