        "Munchausen syndrome is a factitious disorder , a mental health disorder in which a person repeatedly and deliberately acts as if they have a physical or mental illness when they are not really sick. It is considered a mental illness because it is associated with severe emotional difficulties.",
        "Munchausen syndrome is named for Baron von Munchausen, an 18th-century German officer who was known for embellishing the stories of his life and experiences. It is the most severe type of factitious disorder. Most of the symptoms in people with Munchausen syndrome are related to physical illness — symptoms such as chest pain , stomach problems , or fever — rather than those of a mental disorder.",
        "NOTE: Although Munchausen syndrome usually refers to a factitious disorder with mostly physical symptoms, the term is sometimes used to refer to factitious disorders in general. In this article, Munchausen syndrome refers to the type of factitious disorder with mostly physical symptoms.",
        "Munchausen syndrome by proxy",
        "This is the term used when someone (usually a parent or caregiver) acts as if the person in their care is sick when they're not. It's also known as a factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA) because the person lies about the mental or physical health of another person. Typically the person they present as ill is a child younger than 6 or an elderly or disabled adult. Sometimes, these caregivers even introduce illnesses in those under their care. These actions are to gain sympathy and attention from others."
