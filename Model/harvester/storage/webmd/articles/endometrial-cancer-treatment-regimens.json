        "Endometrial cancer starts in the endometrium, the lining of the uterus. Advanced or late-stage endometrial cancer has spread to other parts of the belly or to distant organs like the liver, lungs, or brain. Surgery to remove the tumor is often the first treatment for early-stage endometrial cancer. But by the time the cancer is advanced, it may have spread too far to completely remove surgically. Advanced endometrial cancer treatment can still involve surgery. But it usually also includes treatments like radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted drugs, and immunotherapy. Treatments for late-stage endometrial cancer have improved in recent years. Molecular testing, which checks your blood and cells for certain genes, proteins, or other substances that help the cancer grow, makes it easier for your doctors to tailor treatment to you. Having more treatment options can give you a better outcome. As you start the treatment process, it's important to know your choices and how they might affect you. The more you understand, the better you can advocate for yourself and be an active part of care decisions with your medical team."

        "This treatment may be an option if the cancer has spread to lymph nodes in your belly but not to other organs. Taking out as much of the tumor as possible, called debulking, could improve your outlook. A total hysterectomy is the most common surgery for endometrial cancer. It removes the uterus and cervix. The surgeon may also take out both fallopian tubes and the ovaries, called bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, as well as any lymph nodes that contain cancer. A hysterectomy can be done in a few ways: Open hysterectomy. The surgeon makes one cut in the front of your belly and removes your uterus, and possibly your fallopian tubes and ovaries. Doing the surgery through one incision makes it easier for your doctor to find and take out as much of the cancer as possible. Laparoscopy (minimally invasive surgery). The surgeon makes a few small cuts in your belly and places a thin tube with a camera at the end and other instruments into these incisions. Your doctor may remove your uterus through your vagina. Because laparoscopic openings are smaller than an open hysterectomy incision, recovery time is often quicker. Robot-assisted laparoscopy. Some surgeons sit at a control panel and perform the hysterectomy with robotic arms. The recovery time is similar to that of a laparoscopy."

        "If the cancer has spread to other organs in your belly, you may need a bigger procedure called pelvic exenteration. The surgeon removes your uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. They may also take out your bladder, urethra, and rectum if cancer has spread there, and then reconstruct these organs. Your recovery depends on the method your surgeon used to perform the hysterectomy. After an open hysterectomy, you'll stay in the hospital for two to seven days. Full recovery can take four to six weeks. With a laparoscopic hysterectomy, you'll go home the same day or the next day. Recovery takes three to four weeks. It's normal to have some pain, redness, bruising, swelling, and itching around the incisions while you heal. These symptoms can last for one to two months. After a hysterectomy, your periods will stop. You won't be able to get pregnant. If your ovaries are removed, you'll go into menopause, with symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, and vaginal dryness. Your risk of bone loss (osteoporosis) also increases. A hysterectomy can affect your sex life. Ask your oncologist and gynecologist about hormone therapy and other non-medicine treatments for menopause and sexual symptoms. The goal of a hysterectomy is to get rid of as much cancer as possible, but this treatment can cause a lot of anxiety and stress. Everyone responds to surgery differently. If you're struggling emotionally after the procedure, you could ask for help from a mental health professional or join a support group for people with late-stage endometrial cancer."
