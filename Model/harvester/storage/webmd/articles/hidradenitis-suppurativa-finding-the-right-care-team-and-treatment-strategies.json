        "Oct. 16, 2025 -- Recurring painful bumps in your underarms, groin, or under the breasts may seem like acne – but they could be hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) , a chronic, often misunderstood skin condition. HS affects up to four percent of people in the U.S., yet it’s frequently misdiagnosed or dismissed. What can those impacted do to heal and prevent these bumps? What are the misconceptions about HS? And how can patients advocate for themselves? We spoke with Vivian Shi, MD , a board-certified dermatologist, about the early warning signs of HS, treatment options ranging from topical therapies to biologics and surgery, and debunked myths linking HS to poor hygiene. We also hear from Ebone Colbert, who shares her 15-year journey with HS, from symptoms to diagnosis, and why support and the right care team matter."

It’s not as straightforward as skin cancer, for example, where UV light plus a genetic risk in the right setting causes skin cancer. For inflammatory diseases in dermatology, it’s a little bit more complicated.",
        "Shi: So if any of you listeners know the root cause, I wanna get connected, I wanna take notes, I wanna learn from you. So we don’t know the root cause yet. It’s thought to be due to a constellation of causes. And since we don’t have a silver bullet yet, all the treatment options we design in the treatment toolbox for HS patients are aimed to target each of the known causes for HS.",
        "Shi: So there is likely a genetic component because we know there are patients with family members with HS. There’s an environmental component—for example, humidity, heat, exercise, and friction tend to worsen HS. There’s a hormonal component to it too, especially prominent in women. Um, some people report cyclic flares with their ovarian cycle. And there’s dysregulated inflammation, if you would, and part of it is due to immune dysregulation to bacteria and other normal things in our skin, coupled with abnormal scar-forming tunnels."

HS often starts this way, and recognizing the pattern early on can help get the right diagnosis and connect you with care sooner. And that’s important because HS can have serious complications, from scarring to developing tunnels under your skin.",

  "meta_description": "Recurring painful bumps in your underarms, groin, or under the breasts may seem like acne – but they could be hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a chronic, often misunderstood skin condition. HS affects up to four percent of people in the U.S., yet it’s frequently misdiagnosed or dismissed. What can those impacted do to heal and prevent these bumps? What are the misconceptions about HS? And how can patients advocate for themselves? We spoke with Vivian Shi, MD, a board-certified dermatologist, about the early warning signs of HS, treatment options ranging from topical therapies to biologics and surgery, and debunked myths linking HS to poor hygiene. We also hear from Ebone Colbert, who shares her 15-year journey with HS, from symptoms to diagnosis, and why support and the right care team matter.",
