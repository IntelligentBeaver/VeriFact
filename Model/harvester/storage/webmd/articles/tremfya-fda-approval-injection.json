        "Tremfya (guselkumab) is a lab-made, dual-acting antibody medication that reduces inflammation by targeting the interleukin-23 (IL-23) protein and blocking a majority of the cells that produce it. It is available by prescription. The FDA has now approved its under-the-skin injectable version for adults with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) for starting as well as continuing the treatment without the need for intravenous (IV) infusions.",
        "Unlike previous IL-23 inhibitors that required IV infusions to start the therapy, Tremfya now offers both under-the-skin shots and IV options, making it easier for about 3 million people in the U.S. with UC or Crohn’s disease to begin and continue their therapy with convenient injections at home or in a clinic.",
        "By reducing inflammation, this medicine provides relief from symptoms like continuous diarrhea, stomach pain, fatigue, weight loss, and rectal bleeding or bloody stools — making daily life more manageable. It offers a convenient option, especially if standard treatments like biologics or JAK inhibitors haven’t worked well for you or are unsuitable for certain reasons.",
        "Tremfya is also FDA-approved for treating skin and joint conditions like plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis."

        "Patients saw symptom relief starting as early as two weeks, with improvements lasting through week 24. By week 12, 26% of patients receiving injectable Tremfya every four weeks vs. 7% of those getting a placebo achieved clinical remission. Similarly, 36% of those getting injectable Tremfya vs. 12% of those getting a placebo saw endoscopic healing.

        "The most common side effects include redness, bruising, or pain where the injection is given, joint pain, a stuffy or runny nose, headache, stomach flu, tiredness, viral (herpes simplex) or fungal skin infections, fever, and skin rashes. More serious but less common risks include allergic reactions, liver problems, and infections, especially if you’ve had tuberculosis (TB) in the past."
