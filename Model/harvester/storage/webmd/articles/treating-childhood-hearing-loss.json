        "Nov. 5, 2001 -- We may think of vision as our most important sense, and the worst one to lose. But hearing loss , especially early in life, can be far more devastating because it can profoundly affect a child's speech and language ability. Fortunately, new technology allows us not only to diagnose hearing loss in very young children, but also to treat it and prevent its devastating consequences."

        "Treatment for hearing loss depends on its cause. According to William M. Luxford, MD, a specialist in otolaryngology and an associate of the House Ear Clinic at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles, most hearing loss caused by problems with the outer or middle ear can be treated with medicine (such as antibiotics to clear up an infection) or by cleaning out the ear canals. Occasionally, surgery is required to repair damage to the eardrum or the bones of the middle ear, or to place a tube through the eardrum to allow fluid in the middle ear to dry up.",

Keith tells WebMD that hearing aids have improved dramatically in the last few years. The new digital hearing aids analyze sound through a computer chip to amplify voices and filter out background noise. Some can be programmed to meet an individual's particular needs and may have a volume control feature that automatically amplifies soft voices without ever delivering a too-loud sound to the wearer's ear."
