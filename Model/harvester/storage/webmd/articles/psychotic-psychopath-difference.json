        "Instead of saying that people are \"psychotic,\" experts say that a person has psychosis. Psychosis isn't a condition in itself. It's a set of symptoms that show a person has disruptions in their thoughts and perceptions that make it hard for them to tell what is real and what isn't. It's usually brought on by a mental health condition, medical condition, or substance abuse or withdrawal.",
        "And \"psychopath\" isn't a mental health condition, either. Psychopathy is probably a neurodevelopmental disorder that makes it difficult for the person to have empathy for other people. Neurodevelopmental conditions are changes in the way a person's brain develops that cause them to have disabilities in thinking, communication, behavior, or motor skills.",
