However, it should not be given to women who have already had breast cancer nor should it be used in the treatment of breast cancer."

Some findings suggest that Evista might be less likely to cause clots, pulmonary embolisms, and strokes than tamoxifen. But other studies say there is no difference. Both raloxifene and tamoxifen carry risks. Because of the possible side effects, you and your doctor should cautiously weigh the benefits and risks of using either drug to prevent invasive breast cancer."
