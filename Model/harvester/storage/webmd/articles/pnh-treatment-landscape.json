        "Treatments for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) can improve your quality of life and longevity. There have been plenty of advancements in PNH treatments in recent years, and more are on the horizon. As of now, the only possible cure for PNH is a bone marrow transplant, which is also called a stem cell transplant. The procedure involves injecting healthy stem cells into your body to eventually make more. But a bone marrow transplant is risky and isn’t right for everyone. That said, there are various treatments available to ease symptoms and prevent more problems from PNH. Many treatments can stop or slow red blood cells from breaking down – a process called hemolysis – which is what can lead to symptoms and complications."

        "If you do treat your PNH, you may get a blood transfusion. This is when you receive a donor’s healthy blood through a needle inserted into your vein. Other treatment options include taking: Iron if you’re not getting enough Folate to help you make more red blood cells Growth factors to boost blood cell growth Blood thinners to lower the chances of blood clots that are common with the disorder Aplastic anemia can occur if you have PNH, so you may need to treat that condition as well. This happens when your bone marrow doesn’t make enough blood cells. Scientists think this happens because your immune system attacks your bone marrow. Your doctor may recommend immunosuppressive drugs like antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine if you have aplastic anemia. Some doctors may suggest taking prednisone to slow red blood cell destruction. Others say it may not work and could be risky. All the treatments listed above used to be the only way to help people with PNH. About 40%-60% of people with PNH used to experience blood clots, or thrombosis, which was a main reason for PNH-related deaths. Loss of kidney function also was a top cause of death in people with PNH. PNH treatment in the U.S. changed dramatically in 2007 when the FDA approved the first drug to treat the disorder. Since then, PNH treatments have mostly focused on targeting the complement system, a part of your immune system with blood proteins that help you fight infections and disease."
