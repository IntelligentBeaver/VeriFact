Some grow quickly, and some grow slowly. Not all of them grow into other tissue.",

It starts in cells that line the ventricles (fluid-filled spaces in the brain) as well as in the canal that holds the spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). They can be fast-growing or slow-growing. If they're fast-growing, they’re called anaplastic ependymoma . These tumors spread along the CSF but don’t spread into normal brain tissue. Nearly half of ependymomas are diagnosed in kids under age 3, but they can also affect adults.",

These tumors are more common in younger children than older ones, and they typically grow quickly. The most common PNET is a medulloblastoma, which starts in the cerebellum. Other PNETS include pineoblastomas, which start in the pineal gland. Neuroblastomas start in the brain or spinal cord."
