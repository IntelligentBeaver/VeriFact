        "An intolerance to a food affects the digestive system . It means your baby has trouble digesting a certain food or food group. Your baby might have a food intolerance if their body doesn’t have any or enough of a certain enzyme to digest a food fully. Examples include: Lactose intolerance, which means they have a hard time digesting dairy products Gluten intolerance, which causes discomfort after foods with wheat, rye, or barley Fructose intolerance, which makes it hard to fully absorb sugar in fruits and vegetables A food intolerance reaction usually doesn’t happen right away. The symptoms are uncomfortable, but they aren’t life-threatening. Typically, a food intolerance causes: Diarrhea Tummy pain Mild skin rashes and itching Gas Bloating"
