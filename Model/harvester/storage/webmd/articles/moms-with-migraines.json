        "May is for mothers -- and June, January, and September -- 7 days a week, 365 days a year is a day to appreciate mom (or mother figures). One month just doesn’t seem to be enough.",
        "I grew up with a mom with migraines. I didn’t understand it when I was young. But I was grateful that she was able to share information about what life with migraine might be like. I was grieved that she battled them throughout her life. However, I was appreciative that I had a safe place to bring my migraine questions and to learn about remedies. She was such a great support for me. She would make me cold packs for my head or brew a strong cup of coffee (even before I was officially allowed to drink it) to soothe my pain. Those things worked along with her sincere love and concern.",
        "As I went out into the world, meeting less than compassionate health professionals was jarring. I grew up with such love from my parents, younger brother, and other family that to face often dismissive behavior was devastating."

        "It wasn’t just one way, either. Even as a child, I did my best to help my mom when she was down for the count with a migraine. She’d retreat to her room and my brother and I would do our best to play quietly. That’s a tall order for kids who were 4 and 8, but we tried. We didn’t want our mom to have any pain -- especially pain worsened by us. I recall knocking on the door one day while she was lying down with a migraine. I asked her if she needed anything, and she said no. To me, this meant she was powering through and I didn’t like that. There should be something -- anything --  that could help. In hindsight, I wonder if she -- a Black woman growing up in rural Texas  -- was given any options.",

        "Be quiet . This isn’t just for kids. Often, noise is unbearable for someone going through a migraine. It may not be the time to vacuum the floors or watch a movie on loud volume. Keep in mind, Mom --- or anyone -- might appreciate you running an errand away from the house over anything you could do inside.",
        "Bring meds and water. It may be surprising to know that when you are in the middle of a migraine episode, even walking to the kitchen to get a glass of water could be difficult. Don’t assume we can easily walk to get our own items. I keep my prescription meds on my nightstand but know where they are in case you need to grab something.",
        "Gift strategically. Mother’s Day in the U.S. is one day. However, mothering is a 365-day-per-year gig. No one paid me to say this, but moms might appreciate little gifts anytime throughout the year. Consider items that might help relieve her migraines. Gifts like a lavender-infused eye gel pack or a massager for neck and shoulder tension that might trigger migraines."
