        "If you have CAH, the adrenal glands make too little cortisol, a hormone you need to function. This genetic defect causes the body to overproduce androgens (testosterone-like hormones). This can cause problems in both males and females, such as growth disruption, early puberty, irregular periods, or infertility. Females born with classic CAH can be born with external sex organs that resemble male genitalia.",
        "The defect in CAH may also cause a deficiency of another adrenal hormone called aldosterone. Without these hormones, classic CAH can lead to shock , coma, or death.",
        "For decades, treatment has been the same: steroids like hydrocortisone in high doses. But in December 2024, the FDA approved crinecerfont (Crenessity) – the first new drug for classic CAH in 70 years and the only one made specifically for the condition."
