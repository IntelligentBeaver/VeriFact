        "Having one autoimmune disease can make you susceptible to developing another autoimmune/autoinflammatory condition. For me and my psoriatic arthritis (PsA), I developed Sjögren’s syndrome. This is a condition that occurs when the immune system damages glands in your body that produce and control moisture, including the tear system, the salivary glands, the nose, the throat, the vagina, and the digestive system. You should see your health care provider if you experience any new dryness in your eyes, mouth, or anywhere else in your body, especially if you are also experiencing pain with it.",
        "I was experiencing dry, red, itchy eyes, dry mouth with increased mouth sores, vaginal dryness, increased dry skin, increased dry nose, frequent nosebleeds, and dry throat and hoarseness. I also experienced other symptoms with Sjögren’s, including increased joint pain, muscle pain, muscle weakness, swollen lymph nodes, increased fatigue, trouble swallowing, trouble talking, increase in cavities, increase in skin rashes, neuropathy, increase in heartburn and indigestion, and increase in light sensitivity."

        "Since Sjögren’s syndrome is an autoimmune disease, it happens because it mistakenly damages the body instead of protecting it. In Sjögren’s, the immune system attacks the glands specifically. Because I already had PsA, it is likely that the PsA triggered the secondary Sjögren’s syndrome.",
        "As you can probably imagine, when I was going to the doctors to get a Sjögren’s diagnosis, at first, it was not that easy. It was difficult because many of the symptoms overlapped with my PsA. All the eye symptoms were questioned because of my history of uveitis with PsA. The red, painful eyes were itchier, however, with the Sjögren’s and less painful. With the PsA, I often had rashes and dry skin, so I had to prove that the new rashes and dry skin were not psoriasis but were related to something new happening to my body. I was dealing with a lack of moisture. I could tell that it was all happening at the same time, the eyes, skin, vagina, mouth, and throat.",
        "Remember that you know your body best. Keep talking to your doctors if you believe that something else is going on. Keep a journal of your symptoms, treatments, therapies, and what works and what doesn’t. That is how I have been able to get my diagnoses and my treatments and therapies that work best for me. And most importantly, keeping the journal has helped me to realize how real everything is. It gets rid of all the doubt."

        "There are common treatments for dryness in the eyes, mouth, and vagina. I use artificial tears. I have prescription eye drops to help make tears as well. An eye surgeon can surgically close some or all your tear ducts to keep your natural tears in your eyes for longer. I have had punctal plugs placed and removed four separate times. Then I had my tear ducts cauterized. There are over-the-counter saliva supplements as well as prescriptions to help the body make saliva. I take a prescription and chew gum that moisturizes the mouth. There are also special mouthwashes that remove bacteria that build up without proper hydration in the mouth. I have more frequent dental cleanings, fluoride treatments, use a prescription toothpaste and mouthwash to help with removing bacteria in the mouth. Vaginal lubricants can be bought over the counter or by prescription. You may need this daily or during sexual intercourse. My doctor also gave me a prescription for an estrogen cream to treat vaginal dryness as well."
