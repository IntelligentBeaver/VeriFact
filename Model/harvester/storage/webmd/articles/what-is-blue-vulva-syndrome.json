        "When someone says that they have blue balls, they are referring to the medical condition called epididymal hypertension (EH). This condition occurs when those with male genitals stay aroused for a considerable period of time but are unable to orgasm or ejaculate. Due to this, they feel pain and discomfort in their genitals. Moreover, as the oxygen-deprived blood stays trapped in the testis, it develops a light bluish hue — hence the name blue balls.",
        "While the clitoris — the key pleasure center of the vulva in females — doesn't change color, it's equally prone to feeling discomfort when excess blood remains in it for a long time without release. In slang terms, this aching feeling in the female genitals is known as blue vulva. In some circles, you may also find this condition being called pink pelvis, blue uterus, or blue bean. Here, the bean refers to the clitoris.",
        "While many are familiar with the concept of blue balls, very few know about blue vulva syndrome. There's also not much research done on this topic. This is why there's very little awareness about this condition among the female population."

        "When those with male genitals are sexually aroused, the arteries in the sex organs expand so as to supply more blood to the penis. However, the veins carrying the blood away constrict so that extra blood remains within the genitalia . This process called vasoconstriction causes the penis to become erect and the testicles to expand, sometimes up to 50% of their normal size.",
        "For the male genitals to come back to their normal size, the person needs to have an orgasm and ejaculate so that the extra blood can go back from them. When this doesn't occur, the genitals remain enlarged for an extended period. At the same time, there's also a localized increase in their blood pressure, which leads to epididymal hypertension."
