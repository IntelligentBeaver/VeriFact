        "Melina Williams was diagnosed in 2018 at the age of 32 with stage III, grade 3, HR+, PR+, HER2- breast cancer with no family history or genetic markers. Due to the aggressive cancer treatment, Williams lost function of her pancreas and her adrenal glands and now lives with type 1 diabetes and adrenal insufficiency. Originally from San Diego and now enjoying the Midwest with her husband and their four dogs, Williams works as an investigative professional. In her free time, she volunteers for breast cancer organizations such as the Young Survival Coalition (YSC Indy Face 2 Face) and as a treasurer for the Young Breast Cancer Project. Williams shares her health journey, pet photos, and more on Instagram . She’s passionate about giving back to the breast cancer community and hopes to inspire others with her journey.",
        "The persistent pain and tightness that had restricted me started to melt away. With each session, I gained something invaluable: hope, strength, and a deep appreciation for movement.",
        "Through my experience, I’ve realized that too often, people urge us to “stay positive” or “smile – things will get better.” But they’re wrong.",
        "Losing your hair is much more than just a physical change. It comes with an emotional toll that’s deeply personal.",
        "Stereotypes about cancer being an \"older person's disease\" can be incredibly harmful and can spread misinformation.",
        "Some amazing organizations put retreats together just for cancer patients.",
        "I often wore super comfortable and loose-fitting clothes like sweats and oversized sweaters, and I always made sure to have a blanket with me.",
