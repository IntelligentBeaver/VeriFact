        "Cardio . Bicycling, outdoors or indoors, is a great low-impact exercise if you have spine stiffness from AS. Swimming and water workouts are easy on your joints. Resistance from the water helps keep your muscles strong at the same time. If you can do tougher workouts, try high-intensity interval training a couple of times a week. You'll alternate short sprints of intense exercise with periods of less strenuous movement. It can ease fatigue as you build endurance. Try to do some cardio exercise most days, for a total of 75-150 minutes per week. Avoid high-impact activities if they cause pain , as well as those that involve physical contact with others.",
        "Strength training . Train two to four times a week, using weights, exercise bands, or your body weight as resistance. Include \"core\" exercises to strengthen the ab and back muscles that support your spine.",
        "Stretching . Range-of-motion and stretching exercises can help ease stiffness and pain and help you move better. They can also keep your joints flexible and improve your posture. A specialist in physical therapy can help you if you don’t know where to start. It's best to stretch every day.",
        "Balance exercises. Better balance cuts your risk of falls. That's important because AS can cause low bone density and raise your risk of broken bones. Try yoga or tai chi balance exercises, or simple moves like standing on one foot. Do balance exercises three to five times a week."
