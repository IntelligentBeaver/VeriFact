        "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease caused by a feline coronavirus that affects wild and domestic cats. This type of coronavirus is different from the one that causes COVID-19 in people. FIP includes two forms: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), which is common and usually mild, and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), which is much more dangerous.",

        "Feline coronavirus is very common and usually doesn't cause any serious issues aside from mild diarrhea . But when the feline coronavirus changes to a specific strain of the coronavirus, it can cause FIP. The virus will multiply and mutate in about 10% of infected cats. The mutated form causes FIPV, leading to serious inflammation in the tissues around your cat's abdomen, including their kidneys or brain.",
        "Although doctors don't believe FIP in cats is contagious, it's a serious disease. When a cat gets FIP, it gets worse and will likely kill them without treatment."
