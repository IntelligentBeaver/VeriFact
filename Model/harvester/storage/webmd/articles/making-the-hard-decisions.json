You’d be surprised how similar the sentiments are among peers living with diabetes. One thing that always becomes a topic of discussion is that family members, caregivers, and other loved ones always have a lot of advice and suggestions to give -- with their hearts in the right place -- but most of it isn't asked for by the person who actually has diabetes."

If you want to have hope for a better life with better health outcomes, then go for it."

Making a detour in your life so that you can put some better health practices into place for yourself is difficult, but not impossible. As a matter of fact, from my experience, it’s hard. But I challenge you to take a different perspective on this. Life will also be very difficult when you don’t make the necessary lifestyle changes and find yourself seeking medical attention from head to toe because you chose not to pick the “hard“ way that leads to a relatively longer life.",

There are plenty of days that I am extremely unmotivated and tired, but I push myself to get a 20- to 30-minute workout in so that I don’t have to worry about my blood sugars. There are also times when I get urges to go back to old unhealthy eating habits like emotional or stress eating. Just because things aren’t going my way, it doesn’t mean that I have to throw away my A1c for a three-month period just to satisfy my comfort levels."
