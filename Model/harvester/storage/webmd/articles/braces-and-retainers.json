        "Braces are dental tools, sometimes called appliances, that help correct problems with your teeth, like crowding, crooked teeth, or teeth that are not aligned. Many people get braces when they’re teenagers, but adults get them too. As you wear them, braces slowly straighten and align your teeth until your bite is corrected.",

        "Some general dentists work with braces, but most likely, your treatment with braces will be overseen by an orthodontist, a type of dentist who specializes in straightening teeth, correcting bites that aren't aligned, and addressing jaw problems. An orthodontist has 2 to 3 years of advanced orthodontic education and training beyond dental school.",
        "The dentist or orthodontist you choose will ask questions about your health, do a clinical exam, take a digital scan of your teeth, take photos of your face and teeth, and order X-rays of your mouth and head. They’ll come up with a treatment plan based on this information.",
