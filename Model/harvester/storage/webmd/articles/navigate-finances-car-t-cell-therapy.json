Although new medicines are now available to people with the condition, costs haven’t come down. Direct CAR T-cell treatment costs may include: Apheresis (a process that draws blood and, using a cell separator, collects T cells before returning the remaining blood to the body) Biopsies CAR T-cell production Hospital stays Imaging studies Medicines Other related CAR T-cell therapy costs, such as housing and travel, can also quickly add up. If you have to leave your home to be closer to a treatment center, indirect CAR T-cell treatment costs may include: Caregiver support Housing Travel You can only get CAR T-cell therapy at a certified center, and you have to stay no farther than 2 hours away from the center for at least 4 weeks. If you don’t live near a treatment center, you and your caregiver may need to travel long distances for your treatment and pay for temporary housing. You might also lose income if you’re unable to work."

        "Many private health insurance plans cover CAR T-cell therapy, but other plans don’t. Some pay limited amounts only. Medicare covers CAR T-cell therapy. Medicaid covers it as well, but only in certain states. Even if your plan covers CAR T-cell therapy, you may have out-of-pocket costs that aren’t covered, including deductibles and other expenses, Koffman says. For example, your health plan may pay for inpatient stays but not for certain medicines or medical devices. Before you have CAR T-cell treatment, check with your health insurance provider to see what’s covered and what you are going to have to pay out of pocket. Your medical center may start the process by submitting the required paperwork to your health insurance company. The center may also be able to give you an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs. Ask your health insurance company if they offer travel and lodging benefits. Although your plan may cover medical expenses, it might not cover the cost of traveling to and staying near a certified center. “This can be quite costly,” says Hollie L. Benson, CAR-T program manager at Mayo Clinic Arizona."

Contact your health insurance company and find out what you need to do to appeal or dispute its decision to deny coverage. In most cases, your health plan should cover the treatment if you can prove it’s medically necessary, Benson says. You may need to show your past therapies and have your doctor explain why it’s the right treatment for you. If you’re having experimental treatment, you may need to share any information that supports CAR T-cell treatment, such as recommendations published in clinical guidelines from groups like the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Your doctor can help you collect this type of information.
