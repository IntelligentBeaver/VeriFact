        "Male-pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia ) is a genetic condition with no known cure. In the past there have been no legitimate treatment options, but now, with the introduction of Rogaine ( minoxidil ) and Propecia, there's some hope.",
        "Rogaine, an over-the-counter lotion that is rubbed on the scalp twice daily, is available in 2-percent and 5-percent strengths. Originally developed to treat high blood pressure, the drug has been studied for more than two decades and is considered safe, although how it works remains a mystery. While the 5-percent solution works faster, and most say better, some find the consistency too greasy and favor the lower dosage.",
        "In general, the younger the candidate and the smaller the amount of hair loss , the more likely Rogaine will work. Those between the ages of 25 and 35 who have experienced hair loss for less than five years and have only a small area of baldness see the best results, says Arthur Jacknowitz, Pharm. D., chairman of the department of clinical pharmacy at West Virginia University. Learn about the potential risk factors for male pattern baldness ."
