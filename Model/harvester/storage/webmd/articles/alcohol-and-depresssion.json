        "A drink every once in a while can be OK. But if you have trouble managing your drinking, become fixated on alcohol, or keep drinking even though it may cause issues, you might have alcohol use disorder . It's a condition that involves a pattern of using alcohol, which can include binge drinking or having more than a certain number or drinks within a set time frame, or increasingly having to drink more alcohol to lead to the same effects.",
        "There’s also a strong link between serious alcohol use and depression. If you have a mental disorder, like depression, schizophrenia , anxiety, or bipolar disorder, it's common to have trouble with substances including alcohol. This condition can lead to trouble in your daily life.",

There are lots of choices when it comes to medication that treats depression, and there are drugs that lower alcohol cravings and counter the desire to drink heavily. Your doctor will probably treat both conditions together. You can also get help from Alcoholics Anonymous or an alcohol treatment center in your area.",
