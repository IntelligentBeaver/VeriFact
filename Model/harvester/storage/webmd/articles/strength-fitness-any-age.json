        "Whether you’re a lifelong runner who delights in crossing the finish line of a race, a casual hiker who enjoys exploring new trails, or a passionate swimmer who’s still setting personal records, you know the benefits exercise has for your body and mind. If you’ve never run a mile, hiked a trail, or swum a lap, it’s not too late to start. Exercise is especially powerful for older adults because it can prevent or delay age-related health issues. People over 65 should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity every week, including 2 (or more) days of strength training. So lace up your sneakers, roll out a yoga mat, or dive into the pool to get these seven benefits of exercise. Aging increases bone loss and decreases bone density. Studies have shown that in the decade after menopause , women lose up to 2.5% of their bone mass each year, increasing their risk of breaks."

        "Exercise slows bone loss and improves bone density. And strength training appears to have the biggest benefit. Research has found that women who do resistance exercises three times a week end up with denser bones. Exercise could help you add a few more candles to your birthday cake. Not only does it lower your risk of heart disease and certain cancers, but new research shows that taking a brisk 11-minute walk or doing another moderate-intensity activity daily could reduce your risk of early death. Better brain health: A walk a day could keep dementia at bay. Walking 9,800 steps a day has been linked to a lower risk of dementia. Although long walks bring greater brain benefits, even short ones help. Walking just 3,800 steps per day was linked to a 25% lower risk of dementia. Reduced risk of depression: Sadness, changes in sleep patterns, crankiness, lack of energy, and other symptoms of depression don’t just affect your quality of life. Depression also raises your risk for conditions like heart disease, brain function losses, and long-term pain."

More exercise was even better at preventing depression. Group exercise classes, team or partner sports, and even walks with friends are great ways to stay connected as you age. Those social connections can keep you from feeling isolated and lonely. Better immunity: Your immune system becomes less effective as you age, putting you at higher risk of infections. Exercise gives your immune system a boost. It increases the number of cells that fight inflammation and decreases those that suppress your immune system. This makes your body better at fighting off illness. Sound sleep: Sleep issues are common in older people. Sleep loss not only leaves you feeling tired , but also takes a toll on your physical and mental health . Studies have shown that people over 60 who do moderate physical activity at least three times a week report better sleep."

Choose activities that fit your skills and abilities. And don’t be afraid to make adjustments, like choosing lighter weights or walking at a slower pace. Ramp up gradually as you build strength, endurance, flexibility, and confidence. Set goals: Whether you want to cross the finish line of a 5K, take a bike tour in Europe, or do 50 pushups, setting realistic personal goals can keep you motivated and accountable – and earn you serious bragging rights when you meet them. Mix it up: A diverse fitness routine offers big benefits. Look for ways to build endurance, strength, balance, and flexibility to reduce your risk of injuries. Adding new activities like swimming, lifting weights, or yoga also keeps your workouts interesting. Focus on health: Avoid the temptation to focus on the number on your scale. Instead, look for signs you’re becoming more fit, including increased energy, better sleep, and a happier mood."
