        "Jan. 30, 2025 -- Anorexia nervosa is a serious and complex mental health disorder marked by a distorted body image and an intense fear of weight gain. Often misunderstood, anorexia isn't about food or vanity – it stems from biological, psychological, and social factors and can affect anyone. What are the warning signs ? And how can recovery be supported? We spoke with Kamryn Eddy, PhD , co-director of the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School, about how to recognize the signs of anorexia, supporting loved ones, emerging treatments options, and the crucial role of hope in recovery."

We'll unpack the nuanced definitions of a variety of restrictive eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, atypical anorexia, and ARFID, avoidant restrictive food intake disorder, helping listeners understand their distinct characteristics and risks. We're going to explore early warning signs, risk factors across our lifespans, and how to approach a loved one you might be concerned about. This episode underscores the importance of early intervention, compassionate communication, and a commitment to seeking the right support for those affected by eating disorders.",

Maintaining and communicating hope is essential for patients and families because it plays a significant role in motivating engagement and to progress in treatment. Eating disorders don't discriminate. They affect people across all ages, genders, and ethnicities with trigger spanning life transitions and societal pressures.",

  "meta_description": "Anorexia nervosa is a serious and complex mental health disorder marked by a distorted body image and an intense fear of weight gain. Often misunderstood, anorexia isn't about food or vanity – it stems from biological, psychological, and social factors and can affect anyone. What are the warning signs? And how can recovery be supported? We spoke with Kamryn Eddy, PhD, co-director of the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School, about how to recognize the signs of anorexia, supporting loved ones, emerging treatments options, and the crucial role of hope in recovery.",
