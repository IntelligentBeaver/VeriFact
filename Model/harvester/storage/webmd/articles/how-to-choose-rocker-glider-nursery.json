If you want another opinion, you can have your significant other or a family member try it out, too. In the end, you’re going to want a glider that has a wide seat and arms that won’t make you uncomfortable.",
        "Cushioning: The color of the cushioning is important, too. Choosing a light color will mean that every spill will show up on it, and with a baby in your arms, the chances of having spills become greater. Plus, the fabric of furniture can look filthy after a long enough period of normal wear and tear. Avoid beige and pastel colors and, if possible, opt for washable fabrics.",
        "Mechanisms: When it comes to gliders, having a locking mechanism is essential. Locks will keep your glider in place at times when you want to sit still to feed your newborn. Locks are also important to have if you have other toddlers present who may otherwise make their way under your glider and end up getting injured.",
        "Backs: There are two backs to consider when purchasing a glider: a high back and a low back. High-backed chairs offer you a place to rest your head while low-backed chairs can offer more unobtrusive, pleasing aesthetics.",

            "Mechanisms: When it comes to gliders, having a locking mechanism is essential. Locks will keep your glider in place at times when you want to sit still to feed your newborn. Locks are also important to have if you have other toddlers present who may otherwise make their way under your glider and end up getting injured.",
            "Backs: There are two backs to consider when purchasing a glider: a high back and a low back. High-backed chairs offer you a place to rest your head while low-backed chairs can offer more unobtrusive, pleasing aesthetics.",
            "Ottoman: Some glider models include an ottoman that helps you reach your full relaxation level. Ottomans are great for propping up your feet and resting. Plus, they can help improve things like circulation and decrease swelling .",
            "Warranty: Since gliders tend to be pricey, you should check to see what kind of warranty is offered, especially on the bearings. Aim for a glider that offers a 10-year warranty at the very least."
