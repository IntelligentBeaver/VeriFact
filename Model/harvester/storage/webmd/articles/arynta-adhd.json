        "Arynta is a medicine used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD is a common condition in children, and it also affects adults. ADHD affects how you pay attention, focus, and control your behavior. There are three types of ADHD: inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, and combined.  It is often diagnosed during the early school years when children have problems paying attention. Symptoms in adults often cause trouble at work or with relationships. Treatment may include behavioral therapy, medicines, therapy, and lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, sleep, and stress management."
