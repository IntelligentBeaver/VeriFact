Side effects include daytime sleepiness, nausea , and lightheadedness.",

However, they may cause a worsening of symptoms for some people after daily use. Side effects can also include nausea, vomiting , hallucinations , and involuntary movements (dyskinesias).",
        "Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), and temazepam (Restoril), are sedatives. They do not so much relieve symptoms as help you sleep through the symptoms.",
        "Opiates: These drugs are most often used to treat pain, but they can also relieve RLS symptoms. Because opiates are very addictive, they are not typically used.",
