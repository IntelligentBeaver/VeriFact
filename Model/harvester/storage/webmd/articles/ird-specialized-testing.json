If you have IRD, you may find it hard to read or see in low light. Over time, you may lose part or all of your vision. There isn’t a cure, but an early and accurate diagnosis is key to helping you and your family plan for the future. You’ll need specialized tests to find out if you have IRD. Your eye doctor may order some or all of the following."
