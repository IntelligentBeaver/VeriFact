        "If you're a smoker, the healthiest resolution you can make is to kick the habit. But kicking butts often goes hand in hand with weight gain. Is it possible to be both slimmer and smoke-free in the New Year?",

        "\"People who quit tend to think, 'It's only been two weeks and I've gained two pounds. What's it going to be like in two months?' And they go back to smoking to avoid the weight gain,\" Purcell tells WebMD."

            "Drink more water. Shoot for eight, 8-ounce glasses of water a day, says Purcell. This will keep you hydrated, help you feel full, and give you something to do with your hands.",
            "Make smart choices when snacking. \"Quitting smoking will increase your snacking,\" says Purcell. While you should avoid substituting food for cigarettes, you should plan healthy snacks , like cut-up veggies, fruit, or almonds or pistachios (in limited amounts.) Try to avoid sugar and unhealthy starches. If you feel you must have sweets, go for sugarless and fat-free ones, suggests Purcell. But keep in mind that fat-free snacks often have just as many calories due to the added sugar.",
            "When a craving for a cigarette strikes, be prepared. \"If you want certain snacks around, make sure they're handy and healthy,\" says Purcell. \"Have water around. Take a walk, have a soda. Think these things through so when an urge hits, you are prepared. It's all about careful planning.\"",
