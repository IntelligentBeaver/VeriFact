        "If you're looking for relief from tummy trouble, you may want to consider trying helpful bacteria and yeast called probiotics . Millions of friendly bacteria live in your intestines, and they're important for your digestion. But diarrhea can throw the microbes in your gut off balance. Probiotics may help get things back on track. You can find probiotics in certain foods, like yogurt, and they also come in the form of supplements. Not all probiotics can ease diarrhea, though, and some help only certain types of diarrhea. So which ones can help, and when?"
