This event is life-changing, and as you recover and move forward, it’s crucial to have a solid grasp on your cholesterol management. Lowering your cholesterol can reduce your risk of future cardiac events and improve your overall cardiovascular health. Your doctor will go over your goals and lifestyle changes that are best for you based on your health history and cardiac function."

        "In general, doctors recommend a total cholesterol level of about 150 mg/dL,  with LDL, or “bad,” cholesterol at or below 100 mg/dL. These levels can lower your risk of heart disease and stroke. But after a coronary event, you’re at a higher risk of having another cardiovascular event and should aim for lower cholesterol numbers than you did before the event. Your doctor may tell you to lower your LDL, or “bad,” cholesterol levels by at least 50%. Or your doctor may tell you to aim for an LDL cholesterol of 70 mg/dL or below. But some doctors may target your “bad,” or LDL, cholesterol level below 55 mg/dL. This level is ideal for people with a history of heart issues because LDL levels below 55 mg/dL lowers the risk of another coronary event."

If high cholesterol runs in your family, lifestyle changes may not be enough to lower your cholesterol and your risk of a coronary event can be higher. You may need to take one or more medications to lower your levels. Statins, which are medications you take once a day by mouth, work by reducing the cholesterol your liver makes and by helping your liver get rid of extra cholesterol already present in your bloodstream. Doctors often prescribe statins for people who haven’t had a coronary event but who live with high levels of “bad” cholesterol or high blood pressure, even after trying lifestyle changes. Taking a statin can reduce your risk of having another coronary event in the future but once you start taking a statin, you typically take it for life."

You’ll also learn more about heart health and how to make healthy changes that work for you. You may start cardiac rehab while you’re still in the hospital after your coronary event.

        "The best way to lower your cholesterol is to eat less saturated fat and limit it to less than 6% of your daily calories. Try to avoid trans fat completely. Foods high in saturated and trans fats include red meat and dairy products made with whole milk. For more heart-healthy choices, go for skim milk, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, and healthy cooking oils such as vegetable oil. Limit the fried foods you eat, too. There are many non-meat sources of protein like beans, nuts, and seeds. Plant- and dairy-based protein can lower both “bad,” or LDL, and total cholesterol. If you do include animal protein in your diet, stick to these heart-healthy eating habits: Choose white meat or fish and poultry. Avoid red meat. If you eat red meat, choose only lean pieces like round, loin, or sirloin instead of prime cuts. Pick cuts with very little visible fat. Remove any fat before cooking. Avoid processed meats like bacon, ham, sausage, or hot dogs."
