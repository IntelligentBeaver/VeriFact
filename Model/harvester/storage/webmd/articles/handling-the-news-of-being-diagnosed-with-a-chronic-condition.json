        "Have you ever sat in a doctor’s office, nervously waiting for them to share what your gut tells you is bad news? Your heart was probably pounding, and you couldn’t stop your hands and legs from shaking. I know the feeling firsthand.",
        "In 2018, my doctor informed me that I had developed prediabetes and was at risk of later developing type 2 diabetes. In that cold office, he warned me about the other potential complications: high blood pressure and heart disease. He was straight with me. Unfortunately, I failed to take his advice seriously enough to make immediate changes. So at 268 pounds, the heaviest I had ever been, my attitude was, “Well, at least I don’t have full-blown type 2 diabetes. So I’m good.”",
        "Fast forward. The consequences of disregarding my health became evident by August 2020 when I found myself in a hospital bed, receiving the diagnosis that I had finally developed type 2. Dang! There I was: A diabetic person. Overweight, stressed, fatigued, dehydrated, and being pumped full of meds to stabilize my condition. My hospital stay led me to contemplate my life, its purpose, and how I almost died. Real talk."
