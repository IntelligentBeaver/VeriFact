Researchers have found that some people with the condition have a gene flaw that causes a lack of proteins called filaggrin and loricrin in their skin. They help form the protective outer layer of our skin and keep out germs and more. A lack of filaggrin dries out and weakens that skin barrier. People who don't make enough of these proteins lose more water from their skin, which causes the dryness and itchiness of eczema. This makes skin vulnerable to irritants, like soaps and detergents. It also makes it easier for allergens to get into the body. Scientists believe that that makes people more sensitive to those allergens and even some foods. One study found that infants with eczema had a breakdown in their skin barrier that made them more likely to get food allergies. That breakdown exposed immune cells in their skin to proteins in foods like eggs and cow's milk. These proteins caused their immune system to react.",
