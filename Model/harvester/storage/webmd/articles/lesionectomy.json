        "A lesionectomy is an operation to remove a lesion -- a damaged or abnormally functioning area -- in the brain . Brain lesions include tumors, scars from a head injury or infection, abnormal blood vessels, hematomas (a swollen area filled with blood ), and congenital malformations (brain malformations at birth).",
        "A lesion seems to cause seizures in about 20% to 30% of people with epilepsy who do not improve after taking medication ; it is not known for certain if the lesion itself triggers the seizures, or if the seizures result from irritation to the brain tissue surrounding the lesion. For this reason, surgery may also include the removal of a small rim of brain tissue around the lesion, called lesionectomy plus corticectomy."

Another test to assess electrical activity in the brain is EEG-video monitoring, in which video cameras are used to record seizures while the EEG monitors the brain's activity. In some cases, invasive monitoring -- in which electrodes are placed inside the skull over a specific area of the brain -- is also used to further identify the tissue responsible for seizures."

        "A lesionectomy requires exposing an area of the brain using a procedure called a craniotomy.

This creates a \"window\" in which the surgeon inserts special instruments for removing the brain tissue. Surgical microscopes are used to give the surgeon a magnified view of the lesion and surrounding brain tissue. The surgeon utilizes information gathered during pre-surgical brain imaging to help identify abnormal brain tissue and avoid areas of the brain responsible for vital functions.",

This is done so that the patient can help the surgeon find and avoid vital areas of the brain. While the patient is awake, the doctor uses special probes to stimulate different areas of the brain. At the same time, the patient is asked to count, identify pictures, or perform other tasks. The surgeon can then identify the area of the brain associated with each task. After the brain tissue is removed, the dura and bone are fixed back into place, and the scalp is closed using stitches or staples."
