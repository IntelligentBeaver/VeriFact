        "Pancreatitis is a serious illness that can cause damage to your dog's other organs. It happens when pancreatic enzymes activate in the pancreas before they reach the stomach. The enzymes begin to digest the pancreas and the tissues and other organs they come into contact with. Organ damage can kill your dog. If you think your pup has pancreatitis , take them to the vet right away. Dogs with mild cases have a good chance to recover, but dogs with severe cases may not recover, especially if they have organ failure."
