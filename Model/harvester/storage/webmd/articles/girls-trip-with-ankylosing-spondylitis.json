        "Every year, my girlfriend and I decide on a place and meet each other there for a girls’ trip. We leave the family behind. It is a time to relax, unwind a little, catch up from a year of not seeing each other, and have fun. I take vacations with my husband and son. I also take vacations with my family and other families joining us. This is a “girls only” trip. There is something about getting away from all the chaos of everyday life and heading on a trip with your bestie.",
        "Last year, we met up in Las Vegas. It was not the most relaxing trip because Vegas is so alive with activity all day and night, but it was so fun! We did things that we used to do in our youth. We saw some Vegas shows, went to some dance clubs, and we did some walking. We found some time to relax by the pool. We also were able to sleep in on most days because the city was open all night. Having ankylosing spondylitis (AS) can be challenging when you take a trip to places like Vegas because it is easy to ignore how exhausted you are. I find that you really must check in with yourself all the time to make sure you are not overdoing it. It might be worth it for you to even schedule your rest breaks.",
        "The plane ride to Vegas was long for me. It is incredibly challenging physically to sit on a long flight with AS. If it is possible to get a seat with more legroom so that you can stretch and move your legs around, then do so. If not, an aisle seat is best. You can always stretch into the aisle and then bring your legs back in. Also, I feel like it helps to tilt the seat back a bit for a while and then back upright for a while. This puts my lower back out of various positions of stress for the long flight sitting down. Get up, walk to the restroom, and move your legs a little. This will keep you from getting too stiff and sore, and it will keep the blood moving in your lower legs to prevent a blood clot. Drink plenty of water. Drinking water is always important, but it is especially important while on a long flight and while traveling in general. It’s easy to forget to hydrate with all the fun you’re having, but your body always needs to be replenished with some refreshing water."

        "This year’s girls’ trip was to Savannah, Georgia. It is hot there! My girlfriend flew in from Dallas, Texas, to meet me in Savannah. I took a bus from Atlanta. I have only taken a bus from Atlanta to Savannah one other time on another girls’ trip about 6 years ago. I knew the bus ride was going to be long. There are stops to walk around and to use the restroom. It is important to take advantage of those stops and move your legs. Get up, use the restroom, and walk outside of the bus for a little while. I bring a lumbar pillow, a U-shaped cervical pillow, and a pillow to sit on to take pressure off my tailbone and my SI joints. I dress in layers because it can be cold or hot, depending on how the AC works on the bus and where the sun is coming in. In the shade, it can get chilly. In the direct sunlight, it can be miserably hot.",
        "I have one carry-on and one suitcase that goes under the bus. The carry-on for me is a backpack. Now, I know that a backpack is usually not a good idea for someone with AS. I use a backpack with incredibly supportive, thick, soft, cushioned straps. If I have both straps over my shoulders, it does not pull on my neck or my shoulders. Also, I keep the backpack light. I want to be able to lift it over my head to store it above me in the overhead compartment on the bus. If it is over-stuffed, it will be too large to fit into the compartment anyway, and the weight of it will pull on my neck and shoulders. With AS, the cervical spine can be affected, as is mine, and no one with AS wants to cause any more damage to the neck if it can be avoided. The luggage that went under the bus also must be easy for me to take with me. I bring a suitcase with four wheels to push or pull along. It is small enough to fit in an overhead compartment and not overstuffed to keep the weight down as well."

        "Depending on where you decide to travel for your girls’ trip, they may have hotels, motels, or bed-and-breakfasts that are accessible to those with AS. Some places will have rooms on the ground floor with no steps to get there. Some will even have handrails in the bathroom for the shower/tub and toilet. There are some places that have extra-wide doorways and hallways if you need a wheelchair, walker, or other aid to get around. You should always ask about parking availability and if it is close by. Sometimes, parking spaces are limited, and you will need to park a distance away. This is challenging if you have a day of excursions, and then you return to the place you’re staying, only to realize there are no close parking spaces.",
        "The challenges that I faced with AS on my girls’ trip to Savannah were that there were a lot of places with a lot of steps. Also, there are lots of brick and cobblestone-type walkways. It is extremely hard to walk when you struggle with balance, pain, and the horrifying fear of falling. The architecture in Savannah is historic and old in many areas. This makes it almost impossible to stay in a building that is accessible, unless you choose to stay in a hotel. We decided to stay in a historic bed-and-breakfast. It was gorgeous! It was not accessible to people with AS like me. I struggled with the steps every day. The bed was extremely high, so I had difficulty getting on and off it. I will say that they had water, ice, and tea easily available to grab and to make at any time of day. Also, they ask about your dietary restrictions. I follow an anti-inflammatory diet, a non-dairy, gluten-free, soy-free, egg-free, nut-free diet. All the food that was made available to me was made specifically for my dietary needs and restrictions. That is incredible! I doubt a hotel would be able to cater to me in that manner.",
        "As for the other issues that were challenging for me with AS on my girls’ trip to Savannah, I took it slow. I asked for help when I needed it. I made sure that I rested throughout the day. I slept in. I stayed well-hydrated. I was careful not to injure myself. If I thought something seemed hazardous to me, I made sure someone was there to help make it less hazardous and safer or more attainable. It was hot! Summer in Savannah is hot! There was rain, but the rain did not cool anything down. In fact, it made it more humid, which made it feel even hotter."

        "If you have AS, and you have a bestie, don’t deny yourself a fun week or weekend girls’ trip. We all need socialization and fun in our lives. Yes, we may have a painful disease that tries to wreak havoc on our lives, tries to stop us from enjoying activities that require movement and mobility, and tries to make us so fatigued, we don’t have the energy to enjoy special moments with friends. I find it is worth it to go out past your everyday borders. Occasionally, step outside of your everyday life, and try something like a girls’ trip to expand your world a little bit. It helps me to do this once a year. It may not make me stronger physically to do this, but it makes me feel a stronger sense of self and a stronger self-assurance and self-awareness, too. It helps me to see that I am more than just a person with AS. I am a traveling, fun, spirited, lively, joyful person with AS. I am so grateful to be able to do the things I do and to have the help of others with life’s challenges."
