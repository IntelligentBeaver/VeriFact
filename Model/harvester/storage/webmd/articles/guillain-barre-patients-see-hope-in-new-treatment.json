Doctors diagnosed Stuart with Guillain-Barre syndrome , a rare neurological disease where a person’s immune system makes a mistake and begins to attack the peripheral nervous system (that part of the nervous system outside the brain and spinal cord ).",

Stuart went into the intensive care unit and received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin – a therapy that uses antibodies from the blood of healthy donors to boost the patient’s immune system. It wasn’t enough, and he ultimately needed a second round. He had a complete recovery, but it was a long road filled with physical, occupational, and aqua therapy. He didn’t walk for about 3 months."
