        "Yogurt is one of the most common dairy products on the market today — and for good reason. Yogurt is a creamy, tasty addition to many meals. You may prefer Greek yogurt over traditional yogurt if you enjoy a yogurt with a rich flavor and thick texture.",
        "Greek yogurt is made by straining regular yogurt to remove extra liquid and whey. The result is a thicker, denser final product with a higher concentration of protein and probiotics.",
        "This thick, protein-rich yogurt offers a wide variety of potential uses in savory and sweet recipes. It can also be eaten plain.",
        "Greek yogurt is typically creamier than regular yogurt because of the process used to make it, which removes whey. Greek yogurt can contain twice as much protein per serving as regular yogurt. Protein is an important part of a healthy diet and helps keep you full for longer. If either type of yogurt has added fruits or toppings, the sugar content can be higher than normal, but typically, Greek yogurt is lower in sugar and carbs.",
        "Both regular and Greek yogurt can be purchased in nonfat versions. Low-fat options are also available. The amount of fat in yogurt is determined by the type of milk used to make it. There are also more and more nondairy options available, which are made from coconut, soy, or almond milk.",
