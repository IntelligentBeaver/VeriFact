        "Sometime in the late ‘80s, I went to my family doctor armed with a possible name for my longtime headache situation. In agreement with my friend and co-worker’s diagnosis of my illness, (See my previous article) my doctor told me to come in for an injection the next time an episode occurred.",

I was told to lie down in the exam room for observation of my body’s reaction to the shot. The nurse also told me the pain might spike a bit right before it subsides. Yep, right again."

The survivor I see in the mirror is exactly who I should be whether I got here in spite of my migraines or because of them."
