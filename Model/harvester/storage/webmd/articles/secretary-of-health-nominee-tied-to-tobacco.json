        "Jan. 16, 2001 (Washington) -- Anti- tobacco advocates aren't too excited about President-elect George W. Bush's pick to head the nation's healthcare system.",
        "Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, Bush's nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), faces Senate confirmation hearings this week. And the long-standing governor of Wisconsin, who is popular and renowned for his pioneering welfare reforms, is likely to be confirmed. But on the road to confirmation, he will face questions on some of key health issues, including tobacco control.",
        "\"Thompson is about as good as it gets for the cigarette companies,\" says Stanton Glantz, PhD, a medical school professor at the University of California at San Francisco. Glantz, who has studied Thompson's tobacco record, tells WebMD, \"It's very troubling to have somebody with his intimate ties to the tobacco industry in charge of the FDA, CDC, and NIH.\"",
        "Thompson is scheduled for hearings on Jan. 18-19 before two committees that share jurisdiction over health issues. The sessions will afford lawmakers the opportunity to question -- and potentially grill -- the Wisconsin governor about his stances and his plans for a cabinet department with a total annual budget of more than $400 billion."
