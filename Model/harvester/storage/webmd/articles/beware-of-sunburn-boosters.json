One type is a phototoxic reaction, which occurs when UV radiation reacts with a drug to form compounds that damage the skin.

Those who take the lower dose at night will see blood levels of the drug peak at night, when they are not at risk of sun exposure, she says. That reduces their risk of photosensitivity.",

Make sure to apply at least 1 ounce for adequate coverage, put it on at least 20 to 30 minutes before going outdoors, and reapply every two hours or after swimming or perspiring heavily.
