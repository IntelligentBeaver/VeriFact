        "If you find yourself saying to others “I beg your pardon” or “Come again” more than usual, it could be a sign of hearing loss. Although not as common, multiple sclerosis can cause a hearing deficit called sensorineural hearing loss due to nerve damage in the brainstem. Sometimes it can be temporary, like during a flare-up, and improve once it ends.",

        "I don’t like earbuds. Actually, I hate them. They just gross me out. But since we live in a virtual world now, in some instances I’ve been forced to wear them completely against my will. Just thinking about it makes me queasy. Oh Lord, I’m so dramatic sometimes.",
        "One day, I was wearing just one earbud, specifically in my left ear, and it sounded soft. I tried adjusting the volume, but it was all the way up. I switched the earbud to my right ear and it was as loud as can be. I kind of freaked out, so I switched it over to my left ear again, and the same thing happened. The volume was low."
