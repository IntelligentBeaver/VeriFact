You may find that steaming, boiling, or stewing them will allow you to eat them without increased GI symptoms. If red meat causes symptoms, you could try eating ground sirloin to see if you can handle a leaner cut of beef.

Some fast foods can offer a valuable supply of key nutrients and calories. For instance, pizza offers calories, protein, and nutrients such as calcium and vitamins A, B, C, and D. A milkshake is high in calories and calcium . Of course, if you are lactose-intolerant, you need to remember to take the proper medication before drinking a milk product.",
