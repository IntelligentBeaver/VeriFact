        "Bee pollen collects on the bodies of bees as they fly from one flower to another. Bee pollen may also include bee saliva because they use their saliva to pack the pollen into easier-to-store balls. It contains vitamins , minerals, carbohydrates, lipids, and protein.",

Honey also contains a combination of different pollen collected as bees travel from flower to flower, sugars (carbohydrates) that feed the good bacteria in your gut, and amino acids (which are the building blocks of protein).",
        "“Honey has been used for centuries,” says Susan Arentz, PhD, editor-in-chief of Advances in Integrative Medicine and Australian Journal of Herbal and Naturopathic Medicine. “So there’s a lot of anecdotal evidence supporting its use.”"
