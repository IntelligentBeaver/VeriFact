        "Life with sickle cell disease has not ever been an easy journey for me. Some of my experiences as a person with this disease have not only traumatized me, but they also have forced me to face more adversity than the average adult will experience in their entire lifetime.",
        "Can you imagine being an adolescent and hearing people decades older than you complaining about circumstances you’ve endured before even making it to high school? You think to yourself, “I’d kill to have problems as simple as the ones they are describing.” They’re complaining about missing random weekend activities due to other responsibilities while I’m in danger of missing major life milestones like my senior prom because of weeklong hospitalizations or an unexpected crisis. They get frustrated with having the symptoms of a common cold, while I’m struggling with pain each day I open my eyes.",
        "Living with SCD has required me to become far more mature beyond my years and have a deeper appreciation for the things that are truly important. It’s difficult to waste time on nonsense when you’re consistently feeling as though you are just living your life on borrowed time, and sooner or later, it can be over from complications of your illness. Oftentimes I’ve felt isolated from my peers because of the huge difference in the things we’ve desired or things we’ve chosen to be upset about. Many other 28-year-olds have never stepped foot inside a hospital, let alone feared for their lives in one. However, I have. And over the years, I’ve probably spent almost as much time at the hospital as I’ve spent at my own home.",
        "I’ve had days where I’ve cried in the shower or with my head buried beneath the covers of my bed in a dark room midday. I’ve also had instances where a 15-minute ride to the emergency room feels like 50 minutes because of the unruly and excruciating pain I was in. These days also included lying on a hard, thin hospital bed with a ton of overhead lights covering me while three to five nurses have tourniquets on my extremities, looking for a good vein to start an IV. Yet, the task is difficult because of all the scar tissue in my veins due to years of puncturing and overuse. The desperate search continues even though I’m usually dehydrated by then, causing there to be not a single promising vein in sight."

        "After each nurse has tried their luck at least once or twice with no success, they’ll begin suggesting locations for the IV like my neck or foot. The pain has my spirit screaming and my body squirming, but still I’m trying my hardest to stay motionless for the inexperienced nurse working the nightshift in the ER who has attempted to start the IV for almost an hour and is on her third try. A nurse with compassion would have just requested assistance by now, but mine’s pride is too fragile, and they’d rather continue puncturing my already inflamed body with needles with no results instead of asking another nurse for help.",
        "A person living without SCD could never understand what it feels like to have each breath get more and more shallow with each tear that falls from your eyes as you are racked with pain and must wait on someone else to come save you from it. Medication can provide some relief, but you are at the hands of doctors or nurses who don’t consider the impact of moving quickly to provide your treatment."

They wouldn’t know how it feels to see the people who love you watch you endure some of the worst times in your life, and notice them feeling paralyzed because there is absolutely nothing they can do to stop it from happening. They will never experience having that pain time after time because you need more appropriate care, and no one is concerned enough to provide it for you."
