        "Nov. 21, 2024 -- Domestic violence affects millions of people in the United States, regardless of ethnicity or gender, and can take on the form of mental, physical, emotional, sexual, or financial abuse. Myths like “it’s easy to leave” or “it only happens to certain people” add layers of stigma and make it harder for survivors to speak up, get help, or leave. What are the critical signs we should recognize to better support those affected? And what kind of help can survivors expect from existing resources? In this special episode, we sat down with Lyndsey Dearlove, global director of operations at NO MORE , who highlights the widespread impact of domestic violence and shares essential tools and resources. We then spoke with Denise Murray, senior manager at the National Domestic Violence Hotline , about the critical support that the hotline provides, including what to expect when you call and the trauma-informed approach they take to empowering survivors.",

Myths like “it’s easy to leave” or “it only happens to certain people” add layers of stigma and make it harder for survivors to speak up, get help, or leave. What are the critical signs we should recognize to better support those affected? And what kind of help can survivors expect from existing resources?",
