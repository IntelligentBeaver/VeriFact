        "Spring Kapchinski, 32, is pregnant with twins that she and her husband, Max, conceived through IVF . During the procedure, they had three embryos transferred. At first, their doctor only saw twins, and then the Katy, Texas, couple got a surprise -- there was a triplet. But a few days later, one of the triplets miscarried, leaving the couple with the twins Spring is carrying. This is the couple's second attempt at IVF; their first resulted in a miscarriage. The twins are due in June.",

        "We were not hoping for twins, necessarily. My husband and I both have twins that run in our families and figured that we had a good chance of having twins.",
        "We never would have guessed that we couldn't conceive on our own. But by the time we did IVF, we [had been] trying for 4.5 years to get pregnant , with no luck.",
        "So by the time we did IVF, it wasn't necessarily a hope anymore for twins, it was just a hope for a healthy baby. But we were very excited to find out it was twins."
