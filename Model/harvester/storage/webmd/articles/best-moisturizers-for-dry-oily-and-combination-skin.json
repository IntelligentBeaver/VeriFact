        "Dry Skin",
        "Dry skin can be a result of genetic conditions, like eczema, which occur due to the absence of proteins and various substances that protect against trans-epidermal water loss. To restore the skin barrier, products that contain ceramides are essential. I recommend CeraVe Moisturizing Cream. This is oil-free, so it’s also safe to use for acne-prone skin.",
        "Dry skin can also develop over time from environmental causes, like dry climates or medications that dry out your skin’s natural oil production. Opt for products with humectants, like hyaluronic acid, to draw water into the skin and aid in moisturizing. I recommend CeraVe Hydrating Hyaluronic Acid Face Serum. Additionally, occlusive moisturizers, like Vaseline or Aquaphor, are also helpful to retain the body’s natural moisturizing capabilities.",
        "Oily Skin",
        "Oily skin is a product of overactive oil glands. While this aids in natural skin hydration, it can also make your skin more prone to breakouts. Additionally, excess oil production can make pores look more prominent, a common complaint I hear from my oil-prone patients. Oily skin is often genetic and difficult to control without prescription medications from your dermatologist. To control the oil, I recommend gel-based moisturizers that offer hydration, while not worsening the oil: Products like Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream or CeraVe Ultra-Light Moisturizing Gel. Also, always opt for oil-free products, including serums and sunscreens."

Typical sensitive skin patients may also have underlying conditions, such as rosacea or eczema (atopic dermatitis). Microscopically, there is typically an impaired barrier that causes significant irritation to develop. I recommend products that are absent of harsh chemicals or have limited amounts of inactive ingredients. Sensitive skin care lines, like Vanicream, are all-encompassing and offer many staple skin care products to choose from.",
