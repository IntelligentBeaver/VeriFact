        "Sept. 18, 2023 -- The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria says it may not reach its goal of ending those three diseases by 2030 because of climate change, conflict, deepening inequalities, and growing threats to human rights.",
        "“Working together, the Global Fund partnership has saved 59 million lives over the past two decades,” Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund, said in a news release that accompanied the release of the fund’s annual report .  “Despite several record-breaking results achieved in 2022, we will not achieve the 2030 targets unless we take extraordinary steps.”",
        "The fund has recovered from a slowdown caused by the international COVID-19 pandemic , the release said, but faces other problems.",
        "Some diseases are spreading because of climate change, the fund said. Malaria is spreading to highland parts of Africa that were previously too cold for mosquitoes carrying the illness. Floods and cyclones are causing outbreaks in places such as Malawi and Pakistan. Food insecurity and water scarcity are causing groups to move, making them vulnerable to diseases like TB."
