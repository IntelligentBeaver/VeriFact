        "Plaque psoriasis , the most common form of psoriasis, is a type of autoimmune condition where the body’s immune cells attack its own healthy cells. In people with plaque psoriasis, the immune system attacks healthy skin cells, which causes swelling ( inflammation ). This can make too many skin cells form on the skin, causing discolored patches. These patches, which are known as “plaques,” are sections of thick, raised skin that may be covered with a thin silvery-white scale."

Plaques most often appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back, although some people may get plaques on other parts of the body as well.",
        "People with plaque psoriasis have “flare-ups,” or times when their symptoms are most noticeable. These flare-ups can last weeks or even months. Many “triggers” can make psoriasis worse or cause a flare-up, including certain medicines. An infection, such as a cold or the flu, can also trigger a flare-up. Some other common triggers include:",
        "For most people, the key to treating plaque psoriasis is to avoid triggers, moisturize the skin, and apply topical treatments as prescribed. But this does not always work for people with very bad symptoms. People with more severe plaque psoriasis may need more treatments that target the body’s overactive immune system.",
        "The active ingredient in Bimzelx is a medicine called bimekizumab. This medicine blocks two substances in the body from working, called interleukin-17 (IL-17) A and F. Many people with plaque psoriasis have too much of these substances, which can increase swelling. By blocking IL-17A and IL-17F, Bimzelx can reduce swelling in people with plaque psoriasis, easing symptoms."
