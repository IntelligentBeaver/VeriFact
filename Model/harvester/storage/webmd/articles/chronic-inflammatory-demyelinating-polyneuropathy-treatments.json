        "Treatments for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) help stop your body’s attack on the myelin covering that protects your nerves. They can make you feel better and stronger. Roughly 90% of people with CIDP improve with treatment. Almost 40% of them are cured or go into remission, which means they have few or no symptoms for a while. You may be able to stop treatment altogether if you respond well. But about half of those who get treatment will relapse, which means they start to feel worse again after feeling better for a time. You can recover from CIDP, but you may have lasting symptoms like weakness or numbness. Several types of treatment are available. All of them work by changing your immune system so that it stops attacking your own nerves. Once that happens, the damage to your nerve tissues may start to heal. Your treatment will depend on your type of CIDP and other factors. Your doctor will probably start with the standard treatments: corticosteroids, immunoglobulin therapy, and plasma exchange. If those aren’t effective, they may suggest other options, like monoclonal antibodies and other types of immunosuppressant drugs. You may also need treatment to relieve your nerve pain."

Then, your blood moves from your body into a machine. The machine filters antibodies from your blood, then returns the blood  back to you. The process takes several hours. Plasmapheresis is usually only effective for a few weeks. You may need four to seven treatments over eight to 10 days. But this depends on how badly you need it.
