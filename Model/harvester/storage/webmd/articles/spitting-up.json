        "Spit-up is what happens when the contents of your baby’s tummy come back up easily – not forcefully – through their mouth. It often comes along with a burp. It’s not the same as vomiting, which is when your baby throws up their stomach contents with force and muscle contractions.",
        "If you’re a parent, you’ve probably dealt with your fair share of spit-up. Every baby does it at least every now and then. Some do it often, even with every feeding.",
        "Most babies who spit up are \"happy spitters.” They’re content, comfortable, and growing well, and they have no breathing problems caused by vomiting. If that sounds like your little one, they don’t need medicine. If not, tell your doctor what you've noticed so they can look for possible problems."

A ring of muscles connects the esophagus and stomach. It opens to let the milk go into the stomach, and then it closes again. If that ring, called the lower esophageal sphincter, doesn't tighten, the milk can come back up. That's reflux.",

Also, the lower esophageal sphincter, a valve where their esophagus meets their stomach, may not be mature enough to work the way it should. That usually changes around age 4 to 5 months. After that, they should stop spitting up."
