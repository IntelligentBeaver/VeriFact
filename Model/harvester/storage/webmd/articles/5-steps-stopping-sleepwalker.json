        "He fumbled through the dark, often muttered incoherently, and occasionally walked into walls. But she stopped laughing when he made his way to the garage one night and started the car.",
        "Experts estimate that sleepwalking afflicts between 1% and 15% of the general population. It's more common in children -- especially those between the ages of 3 and 7 -- than in adults. According to the National Sleep Foundation's 2004 Sleep in America Poll, 1% of preschool children and 2% of school-age children walk in their sleep at least a few nights a week. The persistence of sleepwalking into adulthood is common. Overall, it is more likely to happen in sleep-deprived people.",
        "Fortunately, sleepwalking is not usually associated with underlying psychiatric or psychological problems. It's simply a sleep disorder that usually happens when a person is in the deep-sleep phase, which should be the most restful, recuperative phase. Instead, sleepwalkers begin to do activities typical of wakefulness, such as talking, sitting up and looking around the room, getting out of bed and roaming the house, or even picking up car keys and going for a drive -- all while remaining in deep sleep."
