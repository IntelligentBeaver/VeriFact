And, dust mite droppings are the most common trigger of allergy and asthma symptoms , according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology. Although you’ll find dust mites all over the house, they concentrate in areas rich with human dander (dead skin flakes) and high humidity: bedrooms, carpets, bathroom rugs.",

        "Pet Dander: If you have pet allergies , you’re not actually allergic to cat or dog hair . Instead, the allergic reaction is caused by a tiny protein in an animal’s saliva . Even homes without pets may contain dander. That’s because pet dander is sticky and light. It clings to clothes, shoes, and hair . Thus, pet dander can be found in boardrooms and classrooms, as well as at home.",
