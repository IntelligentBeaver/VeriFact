The organization’s recent events have included an open-mic night called “Heart and Soul,” with free STD testing on site for attendees. It also hosted a sex-positive night aiming to educate attendees about STDs and safe-sex practices. Self-love, self-care, and self-awareness of your body is one of the group's most prominent messages. “If something feels or looks different, love yourself enough to be proactive in following up to find out what's going on – because avoidance leads to outbreaks,” Anderson said.",
