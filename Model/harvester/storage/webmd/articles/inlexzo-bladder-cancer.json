        "Bladder cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in the United States and the 10th leading cause of cancer deaths. Many treatments can be used for bladder cancer, and the kind of treatment that your health care provider will suggest depends on the kind of tumor and if it has spread.",
        "​​ Inlexzo is used to treat adults with a type of cancer of the bladder lining called non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) that has not spread to other parts of the body. It is for people whose cancer has come back or has not responded to other treatments. Inlexzo delivers the chemotherapy medicine gemcitabine directly into the bladder, where it slowly releases the medicine to help destroy cancer cells. This approach treats the cancer locally while helping to preserve the bladder.",

The longer the surgery is delayed while cancer cells remain, the higher the risk. Your health care provider should discuss with you the risks of delaying surgery before starting treatment with Inlexzo."

        "Inlexzo is a small, pretzel-shaped system made of a thin, flexible silicone tube that contains a chemotherapy medicine called gemcitabine. Inlexzo is placed directly into your bladder by your health care provider using a thin tube called a catheter. The catheter is gently inserted through the urethra (where urine leaves your body) into the bladder. Before it is placed, Inlexzo is straightened so it can easily pass through the catheter and urethra. Once inside your bladder, it curls back into its pretzel shape, which helps it stay in place while slowly releasing the medicine over time.",
        "After about three weeks, Inlexzo is removed from your bladder by your health care provider. During the first six months of treatment, Inlexzo may be placed into your bladder once every three weeks for a total of eight doses. During the next 18 months, it may be placed once every 12 weeks for a total of six doses. Your health care provider will determine how many times you will get Inlexzo based on how well your cancer responds to treatment and how you tolerate the therapy."

Most people (80%) were men; 87% were White, 10% were Asian, 2.4% were Black or African American, and 10% were Hispanic or Latino. In total, 89% of people identified as not Hispanic or Latino, and for 1.2%, ethnicity was unknown or not reported. The most common tumor stage was carcinoma in situ (67.1%). This means that the cancer was only growing in the inner lining layer of the bladder. The rest had either cancer that had grown inward toward the hollow part of the bladder but not grown deeper (22.4%) or cancer that had grown into the layer of connective tissue under the lining layer of the bladder (10.6%). The median number of prior doses of BCG was 12 (range, 7-42). Nearly all (96.5%) people chose not to undergo bladder removal surgery (cystectomy).",

About 32% of people had to pause treatment temporarily because of side effects such as urinary pain, blood in the urine, or frequent urination.
