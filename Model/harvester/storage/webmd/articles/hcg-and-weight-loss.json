        "Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone your body normally makes. However, during pregnancy, the placenta makes hCG in large amounts. So, hCG is what pregnancy tests measure to find out whether someone is pregnant.",
        "hCG is a treatment for medical conditions such as infertility and hormone imbalances. Also, some weight loss lozenges, drops, and sprays that you can buy online, in certain stores, and at weight-loss clinics contain a lab-made version of hCG. These supplements are meant to be paired with a very low-calorie (as little as 500 calories per day) diet.",
        "The makers of these products claim they can boost your metabolism, reduce hunger, and help you shed up to 30 pounds in a month or two. But hCG is not approved for weight loss and there’s no evidence it helps. The U.S. FDA warns against its use, saying that very restrictive diets, such as the hCG diet, are dangerous.",
        "The history of the hCG diet",
        "British doctor Albert T. W. Simeons introduced the hCG diet in a 1954 medical journal article. He came up with the idea after treating young boys with Fröhlich syndrome, a rare hormonal disorder that causes obesity. Simeons found that injecting these boys with hCG taken from the urine of pregnant women helped them lose weight, especially in places like their belly, hips, and thighs.",
        "The diet he developed claims to help people lose weight quickly by eating 500 to 800 calories a day and adding daily hCG injections to promote fat loss in places like the butt and thighs. In 1971, Simeons published a book about the diet, titled Pounds & Inches: A New Approach to Obesity . In 2009, thanks to renewed attention on the Internet, the hCG diet surged in popularity."
