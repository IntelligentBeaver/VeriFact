Some never worked at all. Others would provide a brief glimpse of what life on the other side of the darkness and deepness of real depression was like, only to stop working weeks or months later.",
        "They'd up the dose, switch the meds, and try combinations of the two – all while I was in talk therapy, one or two sessions a week on average. Medicine has helped me, as I'm a believer that depression is either a chemical imbalance or deficiency – possibly genetic, brought on by early drug use, or both.",
