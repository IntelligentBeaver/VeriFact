It refers not just to food but to a more general way of living or lifestyle. The diet includes many plant foods that come from the Mediterranean and other regions.",

Keys was one of the first to note a link between diet in the Mediterranean and improved heart health. The diet has since been well studied, with proven benefits for heart health, longevity, and a wide range of other health conditions."

        "Does the Mediterranean diet have proven health benefits?",
        "\"It is so heavily studied, and there's been just a preponderance of evidence about the benefits of a Mediterranean diet,\" Zelman says. \"There's such a nice variety within the Mediterranean diet, too. If you're in Greece, you're going to eat a little differently than maybe you would in Italy. But yet it's plant-based with reasonable portions. It's lifestyle. It's exercise. It allows for alcohol.\"",
        "Does the Mediterranean diet work?",
        "Those basic features of the Mediterranean diet, including its adaptability, make it easier than some other diets for many people to follow, Zelman says. Because it isn't rigid, it also can form the basis of a sustainable, lifestyle approach to healthy eating.",
        "\"Compared to Weight Watchers, for instance, the Mediterranean diet is much more flexible and I think more adaptable to most people's preferences, disease conditions, and lifestyle,\" Zelman says. \"It offers a great deal of flexibility.\"",
        "Is it good for certain conditions?",
        "The Mediterranean diet scores big for heart health and longevity , Zelman notes . Studies suggest it may make you less likely to get heart disease, lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, help you manage diabetes , and help you avoid certain cancers and chronic diseases. The benefits for your heart are key, given that heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide, she says.",
        "\"It's really good for just about anyone, unless there may be some very particular things you need to avoid,\" Zelman says.",
        "Who shouldn't try the Mediterranean diet?",
        "Zelman says that people with certain health conditions, including genetic conditions, that affect their ability to process certain foods or ingredients need to take special precautions with any diet. People with kidney disease also may need to consider other nutrient restrictions. Even then, the Mediterranean diet may offer benefits with some adjustments. Zelman advises working with a registered dietitian nutritionist to help you navigate it.",
        "The final word",
        "Research continues to show the Mediterranean Diet, based on healthy foods and physical activity , is a top choice among diets aimed at heart health, longevity, and many other health benefits.",
        "Even if you don't follow the diet faithfully, simply eating more of the foods that are consistent with this diet, dining more leisurely, and being more active are worthwhile health goals.",
        "\"It's survived the test of time,\" Zelman says. \"If you adopt the Mediterranean diet as a lifestyle and not just a diet, and you follow the tenets of whatever Mediterranean preferences you might have — the olive oil and fish and lean protein and whole grains and fruits and vegetables — they're never going out of style. They're never going to be not good for you because they're just so full of phytonutrients and fiber and other nutrients. We've just learned more and more about the benefits of it over time.\""
