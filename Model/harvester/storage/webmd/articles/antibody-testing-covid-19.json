        "An antibody test is a screening for things called antibodies in your blood. Your body makes these when it fights an infection, such as COVID-19. The same thing happens when you get a vaccine, such as a flu shot. That’s how you build immunity to a virus.",
        "Antibody testing uses a blood sample to see if your body has created antibodies to fight the virus that causes COVID-19. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images)",
        "The antibody test, also known as a serology test, isn’t checking for the virus itself. Instead, it looks to see whether your immune system -- your body’s defense against illness -- has responded to the infection or vaccination.",
        "Can COVID-19 antibody tests show if you have COVID-19?",
        "A COVID-19 antibody test shows whether you had the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS -CoV-2) virus, which causes COVID-19, at some point in the past. It could be gone, or you could still be contagious. The test can also indicate whether your body created antibodies in response to the COVID-19 vaccine.",
        "To diagnose COVID-19, you should take a coronavirus test , sometimes called a diagnostic test. It’s simpler and faster than an antibody test. It tells you if you have the virus active in your body at the moment when you’re tested."
