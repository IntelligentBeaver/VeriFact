        "Essential oils have been used for a variety of things since humans existed. History shows essential oils being used in everything including forms of worship, beauty treatments, physical uses, psychological treatments, aromatherapy, baths, and much more.",

There are many methods of extracting the oils, and it’s best if they’re diluted before you use them. I also like to make sure I find pure essential oils and none that have been blended with other ingredients.",
        "These oils have so many properties attached to them depending on which one. Essential oils may be antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, antineuralgic, antirheumatic, antispasmodic, antivenomous, antitoxic, antidepressant, digestive, expectorant, sedative, nervine, and a host of other beneficial medicinal and therapeutic properties.",
        "There are many methods of receiving the benefits of oils externally such as compresses, body oils, and baths; inhaling methods include either directly from the bottle or dropping into your hand -- which I often do when congested -- diffusers, room sprays, and other environmental methods. It’s important to note that you should research oils before you use them, especially if you’re dealing with other health conditions, as we all respond differently to any type of remedy or treatment."
