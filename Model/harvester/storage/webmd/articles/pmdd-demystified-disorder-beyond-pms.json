        "Welcome to the WebMD Health Discovered podcast. I'm Dr Neha Pathak, WebMD's Chief Physician Editor for Health and Lifestyle Medicine. While many of us have heard of or experienced PMS linked to our menstrual cycles, today, we're going to discuss a lesser-known condition that impacts about 1.6 percent of the population, or 30 million people worldwide—PMDD, or premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Very few of us know about the way this intense form beyond PMS symptoms can impact our daily lives. So it's hard to know how to manage it, treat it, or even discuss it with our doctors. So if you've consistently felt like your time of the month is more than just PMS—where overwhelming mood swings, irritability, or intense fatigue take over so dramatically that it leaves you feeling unrecognizable—it's important to learn more about PMDD. We'll explore why sudden drops in estrogen can amplify everything from irritability to brain fog, and how it impacts our relationships, jobs, and sense of self. We'll also tackle the big questions many of us are likely asking: How do I know if it's PMDD, severe PMS, or a different mood disorder altogether? How do life's other hormonal shifts—for example, postpartum mood changes or mood shifts during perimenopause—interact with PMDD? And most importantly, if you do have this condition, what are the treatment options, hormonal or otherwise? We'll look at everything from continuous birth control to lifestyle strategies and symptom-tracking methods that can help us take back control of our lives. If you've ever suspected your body's monthly rhythms were throwing your entire world off track, this conversation is for you. But first, let me introduce my guest, Dr Heather Hirsch. Dr Hirsch is the founder of the Menopause and Midlife Clinic at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and also served on the faculty at Harvard Medical School. She's board-certified in internal medicine and completed advanced fellowship training in women's health at the Cleveland Clinic. She's now the CEO and founder of a private telemedicine practice, The Collaborative, by Heather Hirsch MD, which provides care for women in midlife. She's also the author of her first book, Unlock Your Menopause Type , which hit shelves in 2023. Her specialty practice focuses on menopausal hormone therapy, perimenopause, breast cancer survivorship, sexual dysfunction, bone health, and other conditions common to women in midlife. Welcome to the WebMD Health Discovered podcast, Dr Hirsch."

        "Me too. So before we jump into our conversation, I'd love to start with your own personal health discovery around how you became interested in the topic of PMDD and women's health. You are an internal medicine doc. I'm an internal medicine doc. But it seems like you have really dived into this world, specifically around women's health. So can you tell us a little bit about that journey? And was there an aha moment working with your patients that led you down this path?",
        "Hirsch: Yeah, absolutely. I always wanted to take care of women, and so I thought that that meant OB-GYN. So I did spend a year and a couple of months in OB-GYN residency, but I quickly realized I really loved helping women make complex decisions, and I would much rather talk all day than do surgery. So I transitioned to internal medicine and became board-certified in internal medicine. And during that transition—because I stayed at the same training hospital—so many of my internal medicine colleagues knew me as the former OB-GYN resident. So I would get so many questions about women's health. It really surprised me, and I realized there was kind of this gray area between OB-GYN, where these doctors are trained very intensely on gestation, pregnancy, surgery—and internal medicine. Whereas internal medicine residents, you spend so much time learning about the whole body, but it's kind of easy to skip over some of the gynecologic conditions because, well, that's for the gynecologist. But they're not learning it either. So I then did a two-year fellowship at Cleveland Clinic that was focused on hormonal health. I spent the majority of my time learning about perimenopause, PMDD, and menopause. And I really just had my aha moment that there was this really big gap in women's hormonal health that no one was really doing with just the intensity that's actually really needed. And that just became my mission, my passion, and my focus for the last decade plus."

        "Let's just take a step back. We hear these terms in common parlance—PMS, PMDD. So can you take a step back and help us define what these terms are?",
        "Hirsch: I always say PMS is a physiologic process, not a social construct. Certainly you cannot get away from seeing some movie or TV show where they're kind of poking fun at that time of the month. What's really happening each and every cycle is the estrogen is declining before menstruation and progesterone is rising. This helps us so that we can potentially have to get pregnant every month—not that in today's society that's what we're necessarily always aiming for. When the estrogen declines, women can feel this, oftentimes closer to perimenopause. This can bring about symptoms of low estrogen like hot flashes before your period, or brain fog, or vaginal dryness. And as progesterone increases, that can make us think of bloating, or maybe salt and chocolate sweet cravings, the formation of acne—as both estrogen is declining and progesterone is increasing. So every month there is this physiologic process, and that is premenstrual symptom or syndrome, or PMS. PMDD, which stands for premenstrual dysphoric disorder, is kind of taking that PMS up on steroids a little bit. It's really when patients feel this shift so intensely that it really impacts their function and their quality of life. So they may have severe brain fog, huge amounts of irritability, anger, and hostility—and that's the estrogen declining, because actually estrogen increases serotonin in the brain. So it acts like a natural antidepressant. Bloating, water retention, weight gain, can't get your rings on and off. Women with PMDD—as the nickname for premenstrual dysphoric disorder—will really find that their quality of life suffers so immensely that it disrupts relationships not just at home, but also at work. And they find themselves very, very disarmed and struggle during this time of the month.",
        "Pathak: Can you talk a little bit about how you go about diagnosing PMDD? And I say this because—I'm sure you experience this personally and amongst your patients—is that we are really great at forgetting and not recognizing patterns. Sometimes it's sort of like when you're over that phase and you're back to your normal, you may not even recognize how hard things were. So how do you go about making the diagnosis?"

        "Wonderful question. You know, the same thing exists for perimenopause—and we’ll talk about that—because PMDD can really, really flare in late thirties and early forties, as women are also experiencing perimenopause. But these are both clinical diagnoses. The way I say that is—I’m the clinician, so I decide. So there is no lab test, which for clinicians, we—you know, that can sometimes make it easier. We can clearly diagnose hypertension or diabetes because we've got clear cutoffs, but this is really a clinical diagnosis. So therefore, what I like to do is—if I have a patient who is either describing what sounds like severe PMS or potentially PMDD, or thinks they have it—I like to, in an ideal world (we don’t live in one necessarily), have her journal and track for three or four months. That gives her three or four cycles to really journal and track and see how bad those symptoms are and how much they affect her quality of life. Now, you can also do this retrospectively if they've been doing that. Or, for me, people tend to come to me by the time they've seen several other clinicians. It can take on average five or six visits with a clinician or healthcare provider—your OB-GYN, a psychologist, a psychiatrist, a sleep doctor, your internist—to get the diagnosis of PMDD. So it's really up to the clinician to decide. But when they say keywords like, I have almost gotten fired several times during this time of the month. There's a cyclic pattern to this mood. I've almost tried to divorce my husband. I've gone off on my children —any type of pattern where you see this repeated type of extreme behavior that they feel just is not like their normal self—you can really cinch that diagnosis. And then—we'll probably continue to talk in this episode—but what else is actually very helpful is, sometimes treatment is not only therapeutic but diagnostic. If you do treat with hormonal support and they feel like they function much better, that's going to also cinch that diagnosis pretty clearly for you."

        "Hirsch: Great question. So you’ll tend to see this cyclic pattern. If anything, I want to tell you a story about a patient that I had, because this will put this in clear perspective. When we think about the cycle—although not every woman has a beautiful 28-day cycle—you've got the first two weeks after menstruation, which is your follicular phase, and then the last two weeks of the menstrual cycle, which is the luteal phase. So during the follicular phase, estrogen tends to rise. And estrogen helps increase serotonin in the brain. Not always—some women certainly react slightly differently to hormones. Some women don't really seem to be impacted on a day-to-day basis. But let’s go through the cycle for learning purposes. As that estrogen is increasing—typically around day 14, or ovulation—women tend to feel pretty well. They'll say they feel energized, cognitively really sharp, maybe their libido goes up because there should be a testosterone spike a few days before ovulation. So they're feeling really good. Then we go into the luteal phase, where that estrogen tends to decline and the progesterone is increasing. So as progesterone rises, there can be irritability, low mood, sometimes heat intolerance, bloating, water retention, exhaustion—because progesterone can make you feel a little tired—cravings, migraines, or acne. So when you see this kind of cycle, it can really help when you look at their different behaviors. With something like major depressive disorder, there's going to be more of a persistent low mood that doesn’t have such an almost predictable variation.",
        "So my one patient said to me: \"After my period, for the next seven days, I want to eat fruits and vegetables, and I'm starting to feel really good and motivated. The next week, I am so happy. It’s all lollipops and cotton candy, with a dash of chickpeas and hummus, and I'm just feeling great. The week after that, I start to feel really moody. I'm getting a little more irritable. I'm starting to eat the snacks in my house—lots of carbohydrates, junk food. And then the next week—oh my gosh—it’s pizza, Coke, I’m laying in bed. I’m miserable. I’m snapping at everyone. I don’t want to go to work. I won’t get out of bed. I won’t put my clothes on.

Why can it magnify symptoms like irritability, brain fog, and emotional distress—and how does that ripple into work, relationships, and identity? In this episode, we talk to Heather Hirsch, MD, MS, NCMP, author of Unlock Your Menopause Type, about what defines PMDD, how it's diagnosed, how to tell it apart from other mood disorders, and the latest in treatment options, risk factors, and lifestyle changes that can help.",
