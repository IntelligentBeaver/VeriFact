Geri Butts, 54, says witnessing that culinary feat was a special moment she would have missed if she and her husband David, 49, hadn't decided to become parents to their grandson, Ryan.",
        "According to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 3.9 million American children under the age of 18 live in 2.5 million households headed by grandparents. For about 1.4 million of those children, the only parental figure is a grandparent.",

In her case, she says simply that Ryan's mother was \"not mature enough to take on the responsibilities of being a mother.\" Geri and David have raised Ryan since he was 2 months old and have legal custody of the boy."
