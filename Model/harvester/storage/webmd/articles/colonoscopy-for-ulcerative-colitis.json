        "Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation and sores to form in the large intestine and rectum. It happens when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the lining of the colon, leading to swelling and irritation. This can cause symptoms like diarrhea , blood in your stool, stomach cramps, or an urgent need to poop. To diagnose ulcerative colitis, doctors use an endoscope – a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached – to examine the colon. They might perform a colonoscopy , which provides a full view of the colon, or a sigmoidoscopy, which focuses on the lower part. During the procedure, they take a small tissue sample (called a biopsy) to check for inflammation and other signs of the disease under a microscope. While additional tests can rule out other types of inflammatory bowel disease, a biopsy is the only way to confirm an ulcerative colitis diagnosis with certainty.",

        "If you've already been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, your doctor will recommend regular colonoscopies to monitor any damage to your large intestine and screen for colon cancer. While medications can help manage symptoms, ulcerative colitis has no cure. People with inflammatory bowel disease have a slightly higher chance of getting colon cancer, but routine colonoscopies can detect changes in the large intestine early, often before cancer can grow."
