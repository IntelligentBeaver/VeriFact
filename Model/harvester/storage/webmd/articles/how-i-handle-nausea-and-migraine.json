        "It’s been about 4 years since my last migraine-induced vomit. That’s a good run. I’m crossing my fingers in hopes of keeping the run going for as long as possible. Not that luck has much to do with it. I’m good at managing my migraine illness. That’s the best way to keep me from landing curled up on the floor in front of the toilet.",
        "Even with a well-managed illness, I still experience some level of nausea with each of my migraine episodes. In my fifth decade of living with migraine, I haven’t determined exactly what alters the intensity level of the earliest stage of nausea. There doesn’t seem to be a noticeable pattern at the onset of the attack to determine if my body will ease gently into nausea or dive quickly into the deep end.",
        "Once the episode is in progress, however, a pattern emerges. It’s as if all my migraine symptoms are joined together by a gnarly, tangled string. When my sensitivity to light pulls on the string, pain pulses stronger through half of my head, and a wave of nausea punches me in the stomach. The same happens if a loud sound enters my ears, or my nose draws a strong smell into my lungs."

The queasy feeling rises up in my chest a little more with each spike of pain as the migraine pulls harder and harder on the string. Like a tug of war, I fight against the need to vomit. The medicine I ingested to abort the migraine won’t do me any good if I expel it into the toilet bowl. And so the battle goes, episode after episode.",

I eat as little as possible and hope it doesn’t come right back up."

Because I’m able to catch most of my attacks at the earliest symptoms, my nausea level is easily manageable without medication. For this, I am grateful.",
