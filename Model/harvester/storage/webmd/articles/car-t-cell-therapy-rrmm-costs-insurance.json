        "CAR T-cell therapy is a powerful treatment for relapsing-refractory multiple myeloma. It’s a form of gene therapy, which means that it changes the DNA of some of your cells. This helps boost the immune system so it can better recognize and fight cancer. Although it’s not a cure, CAR T-cell therapy can help you get to remission (no signs of cancer) and live longer. But it has serious risks and is very expensive. It’s only used if other therapies haven’t worked. Here’s an idea of what it costs."
