        "Whether your baby is 6 days, 6 weeks, or 6 months old, there’s always one constant: They have delicate skin. This means many of the bath and skin care products you use on your own body can cause rashes and irritation on them. But there’s a lot you can do to protect your little one from common skin problems. Here’s what to do to keep their skin soft, smooth, and safe.",
        "Don’t bathe them every day . Two or three times a week is fine until they start to crawl. If you wash them more often, it can dry out their skin. Instead, use a wet washcloth to regularly clean their diaper area, around their mouth, and anywhere they have skin folds (think armpit and groin folds, as well as double chins and dimpled thighs). When you do give them a bath, use a fragrance-free, dye-free baby wash.",
        "Change their diaper often. Babies should get a fresh diaper every 2 to 4 hours, or right after they poop. You don’t need fancy diaper wipes: tap water and cotton balls or a soft cloth work fine for the basic wet diaper. For poopy ones, though, you may want wipes to do a thorough cleanup. Choose those that are hypoallergenic and don’t have lanolin or alcohol. It’s also a good idea to let their little bottom air-dry every now and then, so their skin gets a break from moisture. Put them in a crib with waterproof sheets or on a large towel on the floor while they are diaper-free.",
        "Deal with diaper rash . It’s best to prevent it in the first place. Keep their bottom as clean and dry as possible. You can also occasionally soak their diaper area with warm water between diaper changes. Put their diaper on loosely so it doesn’t chafe, and change it every 2 hours or so or after every poop. If you use cloth diapers, run an extra rinse cycle after you wash them to make sure you get rid of any detergent. You should also avoid fabric softeners and dryer sheets."

As soon as you take them out, gently pat them dry, but leave some water on their skin so that it feels damp. Then, slather on their regular moisturizer, but make sure it’s in the form of a cream or ointment, not a lotion.
