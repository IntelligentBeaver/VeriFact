        "Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a rare but serious complication that can happen in people with Still's disease . Still's disease is a type of inflammatory condition that causes daily fevers, joint pain, and rashes. Still's disease can happen in children, known as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), or adults, which is called adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD).",
        "MAS is a serious complication where the immune system becomes overactive and starts damaging the body's own tissues. It can lead to high fevers, liver and spleen swelling, very high levels of inflammation in the blood, and life-threatening organ problems.",

HLH stands for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a serious condition where the immune system becomes dangerously overactive and causes widespread inflammation. When HLH happens in people with autoimmune diseases like Still's disease, it's often referred to as MAS.",
