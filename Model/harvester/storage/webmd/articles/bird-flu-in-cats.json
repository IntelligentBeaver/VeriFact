        "Bird flu, also called H5N1 avian influenza , is a flu virus. It causes severe illness and death in all types of birds, particularly wild birds, ducks, geese, and chickens. Since it was discovered in 1996, the virus has spread to some mammals as well, such as rodents, squirrels, rabbits, and cattle.",
        "The virus is now also affecting wild and domesticated cats, which are highly susceptible to bird flu. This means they can get it easily. Unfortunately, when cats get bird flu, the illness is very serious and often results in death.",
        "“We don’t know why cats are so susceptible yet,” says Jane Sykes, PhD, a professor of small animal internal medicine at the University of California, Davis and a board-certified specialist in small animal internal medicine with a special interest in infectious diseases of dogs and cats with public health significance.",
        "It may have something to do with the location and density of receptors called sialic acid receptors in their respiratory tract and elsewhere. These receptors make it easier for viruses to attach in the body and make the cat sick.",
        "“Or it may relate to the way the cat’s immune system responds to the virus,” Sykes says.",

        "That said, if your cat seems sick, see your veterinarian. Be sure to let them know if your cat eats a raw poultry diet or unpasteurized milk products, or if it’s been exposed to animals that could be infected, like dairy cattle. It would be helpful to tell your vet if you have had that kind of exposure too, in case you brought the virus home. This way, your veterinarian can isolate your cat and use protective gear if needed.",
        "At home, if you think your cat has bird flu, keep it away from other pets and family members, especially if they are immunocompromised , or have a weakened immune system. After handling your cat, food and water bowls, toys, and litter box, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water."
