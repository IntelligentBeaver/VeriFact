        "Feb. 6, 2023 -- A pill that could change the way postpartum depression is treated has been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for priority review, pharmaceutical companies Sage Therapeutics and Biogen announced.",
        "The drug, zuranolone, would be taken once-a-day for two weeks and could replace other postpartum depression treatments that take much longer to have any effect. Because the FDA is giving the application priority review, the drug might be approved this calendar year.",
        "“Most current approved therapies may take weeks or months to work. We are committed to advancing treatments that could help physicians and patients by addressing depression symptoms quickly,” Laura Gault, MD, chief medical officer at Sage, said in a news release . “We believe zuranolone, if approved, could offer a new way for physicians to support patients.”",
        "About one in eight U.S. women giving birth experience postpartum depression, or about 500,000 annually, the drug companies said. The pill also could be used to treat major depressive disorder, which is diagnosed in about 14 million people yearly."
