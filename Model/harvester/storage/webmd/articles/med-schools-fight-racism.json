        "When it comes to medical school orientation, students expect to meet equally anxious peers, hear a rundown of the curriculum, and get to know the professors and advisors who will guide them. However, that day will be a little different for first-year students at University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine. “We are doing a poverty simulation as part of our orientation,” reveals Shirley Smith, director of student diversity and enrichment at University of South Florida (USF). “Students will be placed into family units and experience a month in the life of a family on a limited, fixed income. They will see what it’s like to try to make ends meet and just keep your family intact and housed.”",
        "The goal of this simulation is simple: to reveal the often-experienced social impediments to health, and in the process, teach these future doctors to care, in addition to cure.",
        "A growing number of educators believe students are the key to solving one of medicine’s most insidious problems."

Lessons on those social factors are embedded into all of the rotations such as surgery, internal medicine , and pediatrics. Students are also required to work with community-based organizations in Winston-Salem, NC. “It has been really impactful for the students because of the material they’re able to see in real life,” observes Nancy Marie Denizard-Thompson, MD, associate professor of internal medicine and program architect at Wake Forest School of Medicine. “The students are asking patients about their transportation, how they access their medical care or their food. That way, they know how to adjust a plan so that patients are really able to actualize the care that we provide.”",

If a patient is not following dietary advice, it could be because they live in a food desert and don’t have access to healthier options.

He found dermatology to be one of the most problematic areas. In certain classes, almost all of the examples of diseases were on white skin. Even common conditions can look very different on dark complexions, but how would a new doctor even know what to look for? So Bervell, a student at Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine, launched a series of videos titled “Racial Biases in Medicine,” which showed how certain conditions appear on both light and dark skin . He also addresses everything from why sickle cell isn’t just a “Black disease” to the cognitive bias the NFL employed when evaluating concussions of Black players.",
