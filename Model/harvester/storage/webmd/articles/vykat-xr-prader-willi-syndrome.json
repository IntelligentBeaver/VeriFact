        "Prader-Willi syndrome is a condition that affects your ability to feel full after eating. It can also cause anxiety and constant thoughts about food, or the constant urge to eat, known as hyperphagia (excessive hunger). If hyperphagia is not controlled, it can lead to weight gain and obesity. Vykat XR (diazoxide choline) is a medicine used to manage these symptoms in children and adults with Prader-Willi syndrome"

        "Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare condition usually caused by genetic changes in your DNA. It can also occur after a head or brain injury. The condition affects the part of the brain known as a hypothalamus, which tells you that you are full when you eat enough food. One of the challenges of Prader-Willi syndrome is that people often do not have the feeling of being full after eating and may have nonstop hunger and weight gain. Children with Prader-Willi syndrome may always seek out more food, eat big portions, or try to store or hide food to eat later. Some children may even eat food that is still frozen or that is in the garbage. This food seeking and excessive hunger often sets in during early childhood. If these symptoms are not controlled, they can lead to weight gain and obesity.",
        "Vykat XR may help to lower the urge to eat. The medicine works on certain hormones and parts of your brain that affect appetite."
