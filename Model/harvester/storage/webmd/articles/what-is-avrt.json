        "Normally, electricity in your heart follows one path. The signal goes from your upper chambers (atria) to your atrioventricular (AV) node, a cluster of cells at the bottom of your upper right atrium that helps control heart rate and rhythm. The AV node slows down the signal before it passes to your lower chambers (ventricles). That's when your heart contracts, or beats. It usually happens about 60-100 times a minute.",
        "At birth, you can have tissue that makes an extra electrical connection between your atria and ventricles. That's called an accessory pathway (AP) or bypass tract. When you have AVRT, impulses can go through your AV node and this extra, faster circuit. This creates an electricity loop. That's when you get more heartbeats than normal.",
        "In most cases, the signal circles from your atria, through your AV node, down to your ventricles, and back through your AP. But it can go in both directions."
