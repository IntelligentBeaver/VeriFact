        "Soft pretzels While delicious, the soft pretzel is a nutrition-poor source of carbohydrates. One medium soft pretzel (the kind you buy at the mall food court) contains 80 grams of carbs and just 2 grams of fiber. That's 29% of the daily recommended serving of carbohydrates.",
        "Processed sugary cereal Most cereals aimed at kids are loaded with sugar. For instance, a cup of Post Golden Crisp has 34 grams of carbs, 0 grams of fiber, and 21 grams of added sugar. That's 12% of your recommended daily serving of carbohydrate and 42% of your recommended daily serving of sugar. It's also low in most vitamins and minerals. Look for cereals that are low in sugar or try oatmeal instead  -- the unsweetened kind. You can always add a little sugar if need be, and the carb load will be lower than eating the presweetened kind.",
        "Canned fruit Nutritionists say we should eat more fruit. But canned might not be the way to go if you like the ones in heavy syrup. One 8.25 ounce can of peaches in syrup has 25 grams of carbs (including 22 grams of sugar). This sugary snack would be better replaced with fresh fruit or canned fruit in 100% juice or water. Frozen fruit, which typically has no syrup or juice added, is also a good alternative.",
        "Bagels Bagels seem \"healthier\" than doughnuts, but they're actually deceiving. Bagels have a whopping 55 grams of carbohydrates, while a chocolate-frosted doughnut contains 34 grams of carbs. How about skipping both for some whole wheat toast spread with avocado?",
        "Soda One 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola contains 39 grams of carbs in the form of sugar. This is 78% of your recommended daily serving of added sugar and 14% of your carb budget. S oda is one of the most common sources of empty calories. Studies show that people who drink soda are less likely to eat healthy sources of carbs. A sugar-free soda or sparkling water is a better option.",
        "Potato chips Potato chips contain about 15 grams of carbohydrates. They're also high in saturated fats and sodium . Good substitutes are popcorn (hold the butter) and homemade kale chips.",
        "Candy No surprise here, candy is full of carbs and sugar. Just 10 small gummy bears contain 22 grams of carbs. A bar of Hershey's chocolate has 26 grams of carbs, including 21 grams of added sugar, plus 40% of your daily serving of fat. Keep candy as an occasional treat, rather than something you consume daily or weekly.",
        "French fries One medium-sized order of fries from McDonald's can yield 43 grams of carbs, providing 15% of your daily recommended carbohydrates. They're also high in sodium and fat. When you drive up to the fast-food window, ask for fruit or a salad with your burger instead of the fries.",
        "Sweetened yogurt This can be a healthy food -- or not. Plain Greek yogurt is low in carbohydrates (just 8 grams per serving or 3% of your daily requirement). But the popular flavored and sweetened types might be much higher in carbs. One strawberry-flavored yogurt has 26 grams of carbs per serving. Yogurt typically has a lot of protein and other nutrition in it, so have at it. Just pick a plain or low-sugar variety and add your own fruit.",
        "Fruit juice Here's another product that sounds healthy but often isn't. Many fruit drinks (especially those labeled \"fruit punch\" or \"fruit cocktail\") have very little real juice in them and are mostly sugar. Even ones labeled 100% juice have a lot sugar. An 8-ounce glass of orange juice has 23 grams of sugar, the equivalent of eating five or six oranges, but without the benefit of the fiber. Orange juice does have vitamins and minerals, so it does have some benefits. If you're going to drink it, keep the sizes small and look for products labeled \"pure orange juice.\""
