        "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a very rare disease. It’s also very complex. If you or a loved one has recently been diagnosed with PNH, you may wonder what sort of challenges you will face. It’s hard to know right away. Sometimes, people with PNH have few, if any, symptoms. Other times, they have many different symptoms and complications that dramatically impact their quality of life. Since PNH is so rare – there are only 1.3 new cases diagnosed per million people each year – your doctor may not know a lot about it, either. While it used to be thought that people with PNH only live on average of 15 to 20 years, research suggests that life expectancy has been increasing over the last 2 decades. Soon, PNH patients may have a life span similar to that of people without the condition. But it’s important to be aware of the challenges you may have so that you can best face them head-on. Here’s a closer look at them."

        ". With PNH, you have hemolysis, a condition where red blood cells are destroyed before your body can replace them. As a result, you may have many symptoms that impact your ability to do daily activities. This includes: Fatigue Stomach pain Headache Shortness of breath Trouble swallowing Erectile dysfunction The good news is there are treatments available to help you manage these symptoms of PNH. They include: Blood transfusions, to increase levels of red blood cells. Vitamin and mineral supplements such as iron, vitamin B12 , and folic acid to boost production of red blood cells. Erythropoietin, a growth factor that stimulates your bone marrow to make more red blood cells to boost energy with less need for blood transfusions. Eculizumab (Soliris ) and ravulizumab (Ultomiris), parts of a group of drugs called complement inhibitors that block your body from destroying red blood cells. Medicines to suppress the immune system such as antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine . In the case of severe bone marrow failure, a bone marrow/stem cell transplant (BMT/SCT) may be an option."

          "text": "In addition, PNH can cause sexual problems. If you are male, you may find it hard to maintain an erection. Both men and women may also feel so tired that they have no interest in sex. It’s important to be open with loved ones about all your feelings. They can help you manage your priorities so that you focus your time and energy on things that are most important – and most enjoyable – for you. You may also benefit from professional counseling. Your medical team can help you navigate many of the challenges that come with PNH. They can work with you to come up with a treatment plan to help manage your symptoms and side effects from various therapies and medications. This way, you’ll be able to navigate life with PNH head-on.",
