        "Thymoma and thymic carcinoma are two types of thymus cancer . The thymus is a small organ in the upper chest. It’s in front of and above the heart. It makes white blood cells that help your body fight infection.",
        "With these types of cancer, tumors form on the outside of the thymus. Both kinds are rare. Between the two, there are about 400 cases each year in the United States. Generally, thymoma is less serious than thymic carcinoma. It’s also easier to treat.",
        "With thymoma, the tumor cells don’t look much different than the regular (non-cancerous) thymus cells. They grow slowly and they don’t usually spread to other places in the body. People with thymoma often have autoimmune diseases like myasthenia gravis and acquired pure red cell aplasia too. With these conditions, your body attacks its own healthy tissues and organs.",
        "With thymic carcinoma, the tumor cells do not look like normal thymus cells. They grow more quickly. By the time the cancer is found, it often has spread to other areas. That makes it harder to treat."
