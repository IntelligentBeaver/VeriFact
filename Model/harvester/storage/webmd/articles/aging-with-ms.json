        "Aging with MS is not much fun.",
        "When I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) about 40 years ago, my doctor told me what to expect. “You will get worse until your 60s,” he said. “Then the MS will stop. At that point, unfortunately, aging will kick in and continue to take you downhill.”",
        "There were no medications claiming to slow the disease then, and the doctor turned out to be mostly right. I’m in a mobility scooter now, and at 75, aging is really kicking in big time. My life is shrinking. Because it’s rainy and cold, I sometimes go days without getting out of the apartment building.",
        "Aging has its benefits, like MS does. People don’t expect as much of you; they are willing to do things for you. But like with MS, the downsides outweigh the benefits most of the time.",
        "I notice these downsides more when I’m visiting older friends who don’t have MS. I notice they forget things they knew the last time we spoke. Sometimes, they say things that just don’t make much sense, or things that are completely unrealistic."
