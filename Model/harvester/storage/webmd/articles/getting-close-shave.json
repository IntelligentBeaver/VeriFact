        "Roxanne Griego, administrator and director of the Arizona Board of Barbers, has been a barber for 32 years and followed her father and grandfather into the profession. The first step in shaving, she tells WebMD, is to prepare the surface of the skin . “You want to remove the hair while preserving the skin's integrity,” she says. “Massaging in the cream or shaving soap plumps up the muscle called the erector pili, which pushes the hair up, kind of like gooseflesh. This also releases skin-softening oils from underneath the skin. What you want is to push the hair up and soften it so you can cut it off in one cold snap.”"
