        "March 3, 2025 – The top health official in the United States is calling on all parents to discuss measles vaccination with their children’s health care providers.",
        "“Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote in a statement that was published Sunday afternoon on Fox News Digital and on the social media platform X.",
        "Kennedy’s statement has drawn heightened attention due to his past skeptical comments about vaccines, and amid the Trump administration’s recent cancellation of a vaccine planning meeting that regularly happens among U.S. health officials.",

Officials announced Wednesday that an unvaccinated school-age child had died of measles complications, marking the first U.S. measles death in the U.S. in a decade."
