The bigger fish, such as pike, bass, and very large tuna, seem to contain more mercury because they eat smaller fish and almost immediately inherit those fish's mercury stores.",

By eating different species of fish, you are spreading out your risk of consuming environmental contaminants that might be in any one of those species. When you have a choice, try to avoid the larger fish that are on the list of higher-mercury types: shark, tilefish, king mackerel, and swordfish.",
        "Eat wild or canned salmon instead of farmed salmon when you have a choice, and consider eating no more than 8 ounces of farmed salmon per month, according to a recent report from the Environmental Working Group. (But don't get the idea that wild salmon is completely PCB-free; it, too, should be consumed in moderation.)",
        "Trim any visible fat from your fish before cooking (since PCBs are stored in fish fat) and cook your fish with a method where the fat can drip away while it cooks (grilling, broiling or baking).",
        "Stick to cooked (not raw) clams, oysters, mussels, scallops, and other mollusks. These filter-feeding fishes can carry waterborne bacteria, viruses, or toxins that can cause severe gastrointestinal problems if they are eaten raw or uncooked. Oysters and clams should be boiled for at least 3 minutes or steamed for 4-6 minutes to destroy harmful microorganisms.",
        "If you are a big sushi fan (or if you like sashimi or ceviche dishes), make sure the restaurant you go to is a reliable source for sushi and that they use only ocean-dwelling fish in their raw dishes.",
        "Raw seafood should be kept well chilled, at refrigerator temperatures, even while defrosting.",
        "Be extra cautious that raw fish juices don't contaminate other foods, especially those eaten raw. All utensils and surfaces used to prepare raw seafood should be thoroughly washed with hot soapy water as soon as possible.",
        "Remember that the FDA considers up to 1 part per million of mercury in fish to be safe. On average, the goods in the U.S. seafood market contain less than 0.3 parts per million of mercury.",
        "The top 10 safer fishes to eat are: canned tuna, shrimp, pollock, salmon, cod, catfish, clams, flatfish, crabs, and scallops. According to the FDA, these generally contain less than 0.2 parts per million of methyl mercury.",
        "Buy your fish at fish outlets that sell lots of fish. That way you are more likely to get fish that hasn't been sitting around too long. And don't be afraid to ask the merchants which fish came in today. Look around. If the seafood counter has a bad smell and looks unclean, chances are their fish isn't the freshest. Buying frozen fish works well, too. Just put it immediately into the freezer if you aren't going to eat it within a day or two. If you're planning to cook the fish within a day or two, put it directly into the refrigerator to thaw (make sure it is in a container that doesn't allow raw fish juices to drip on other items in your refrigerator.)"

            "Eating a variety of fish and seafood is a smart way to go. By eating different species of fish, you are spreading out your risk of consuming environmental contaminants that might be in any one of those species. When you have a choice, try to avoid the larger fish that are on the list of higher-mercury types: shark, tilefish, king mackerel, and swordfish.",
            "Eat wild or canned salmon instead of farmed salmon when you have a choice, and consider eating no more than 8 ounces of farmed salmon per month, according to a recent report from the Environmental Working Group. (But don't get the idea that wild salmon is completely PCB-free; it, too, should be consumed in moderation.)",
            "Trim any visible fat from your fish before cooking (since PCBs are stored in fish fat) and cook your fish with a method where the fat can drip away while it cooks (grilling, broiling or baking).",
            "Stick to cooked (not raw) clams, oysters, mussels, scallops, and other mollusks. These filter-feeding fishes can carry waterborne bacteria, viruses, or toxins that can cause severe gastrointestinal problems if they are eaten raw or uncooked. Oysters and clams should be boiled for at least 3 minutes or steamed for 4-6 minutes to destroy harmful microorganisms.",
