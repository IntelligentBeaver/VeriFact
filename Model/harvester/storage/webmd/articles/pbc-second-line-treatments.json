One reason might be that by the time it’s diagnosed, liver damage from PBC is beyond the healing scope of drugs like biologics.

Some treatments work to move trapped bile out of the liver and limit fibrosis, or scar tissue. That’s important, because scarring can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. The first medication you’ll likely take for PBC is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), also called ursodiol. But UDCA doesn’t improve liver function tests for everyone. In fact, between 25% and 50% of people who take it don’t respond or don’t respond enough to it. This makes it more than five times more likely that their PBC will progress to cirrhosis and three times more likely that they’ll die of the disease."

Because fibrates can damage the liver, you shouldn't take these medicines if you have severe cirrhosis. Fenofibrate (Tricor) is a fibrate drug that doctors may prescribe off label for PBC symptoms.

It targets PPAR-alpha and -delta. In its clinical trials, just over half the people being studied achieved normal bilirubin levels and a lower ALP level – 15% reached a normal ALP. The drug also lowered total and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The most common side effects were belly pain, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea."
