        "When it comes to diet, one size does not fit all. The key to eating right for type 2, is finding an eating plan that works for you . Maybe it’s a vegetarian diet, or maybe it’s low-carb. Or you may want to create your own plan using whole grain foods or dumping all processed foods. If you work with a nutritionist, make sure to let them know your preferences and don’t be railroaded into a regimen that doesn’t fit your preferences. A healthy diabetes diet is not a two-week affair – it should last a lifetime.",
        "Get moving. Exercise helps build muscle and lower blood sugars. If you’re already working out, congrats. If not, consider this an invitation to begin. While gyms are closed, consider purchasing a few weights since the best way to control your sugars and your scale is to do both aerobic and anerobic exercise. In addition, adding a 15- to 20-minute post-meal stroll can help fight sugar spikes.",
        "Embrace your blood sugars, good and bad. No one likes to a high blood sugar. But even if you’ve had a few highs, don’t abandon tracking your glucose readings."
