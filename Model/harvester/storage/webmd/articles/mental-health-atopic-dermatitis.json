This, in turn, creates even more anxiety and stress, which leads to even more atopic dermatitis. Here’s why this happens and how to break this vicious cycle."

        "When you go through a stressful situation, your body goes into fight-or-flight mode. It increases stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol . But while this can be helpful if you’re facing an attacker, it can cause damage. In fact, if your body makes too much cortisol, it suppresses your immune system and causes an inflammatory response in your skin. People who live with atopic dermatitis are already quite susceptible to this inflammatory response. This doesn’t mean that if you get rid of stress, you’ll get rid of your atopic dermatitis. But it may help improve some of your symptoms. More than 30% of people with atopic dermatitis have also been diagnosed with depression or anxiety, according to the National Eczema Association. That’s much higher than the general population, which hovers at around 7.6% It makes sense that if you have atopic dermatitis, it could make you feel sad or anxious. But atopic dermatitis is also associated with skin inflammation, which may be then communicated to your brain. This may leave you feeling anxious, depressed, tired, and with foggy thinking."

Both atopic dermatitis and chronic itch appear to activate areas of the brain related to chronic stress and pain. These parts of the brain stay overactive, which leads to the release of stress hormones and other inflammatory chemicals. Research has shown that meditation itself deactivates these parts of the brain, which may in turn relieve itching and lower inflammatory and stress hormones. One study found that people with atopic dermatitis who practiced meditation for 8 weeks reported improved quality of life and less itching. There are many ways to practice mindfulness, which include: Deep breathing Using a guided meditation app Yoga or tai chi Nature walks You may have to do a little trial and error to find a technique that works best for you. Get enough sleep . If you have atopic dermatitis, you may find it harder to get a good night’s rest, which can make symptoms of anxiety or depression worse.  Some ways to make nodding off easier are: Sleep in silk. Try using specially treated silk-like Dermasilk, which is coated with antimicrobial agents such as triclosan. It can help relieve atopic dermatitis symptoms. Keep a constant sleep schedule. Avoid daytime naps. Avoid afternoon caffeine. Keep the temperature down. Lower skin temperature leads to constriction of your blood vessels, which can decrease inflammation and itching. In addition to turning down the heat (or cranking up the AC), you can try cooling pillows and mattress covers. Try a mini massage. It can help relieve insomnia as it relaxes muscles and reduces anxiety. You can also rub coconut oil on areas of skin that have atopic dermatitis, as it has anti-inflammatory properties."
