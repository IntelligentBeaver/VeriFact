NMO, also called Devic's disease, is a rare autoimmune disease that affects your spinal cord and optic nerves. Your optic nerves carry messages from your eyes to your brain. NMO can be confused with multiple sclerosis (MS), since some of the warning signs are similar. Tests can help your doctor figure out what's causing your symptoms."
