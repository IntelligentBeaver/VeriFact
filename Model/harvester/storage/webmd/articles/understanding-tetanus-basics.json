        "Tetanus (lockjaw) is a dangerous nerve ailment caused by the toxin of a common bacteria, Clostridium tetani . You can find these bacterial spores everywhere, but mostly in soil. They're also found in animal poop, house dust, the human colon, and on the surfaces of rusty tools such as nails. The spores can survive for years because they resist heat and antiseptics. The condition isn't spread from person to person.",

        "If the spores enter a wound that penetrates the skin and extends deeper than oxygen can reach, they germinate and produce a toxin that enters the bloodstream. This toxin, tetanospasmin, ranks with botulism toxin as one of the most dangerous. It's absorbed from the blood by the outermost nerves and moves toward the spine .",
        "Once there, it begins to short-circuit nerve signals and block the relaxation of muscles. This results in a tightening of your muscles and the locking of your jaw, so you can't open your mouth or swallow. Once tetanus has spread through your body, it leads to death in 10%-20% of cases, even in a modern hospital setting."
