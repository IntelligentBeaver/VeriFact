        "Interstitial cystitis (IC), or painful bladder syndrome, causes a range of symptoms that include a frequent and urgent need to urinate, painful urination, and intense pelvic pain. The condition is not well-understood and it is difficult to treat. The pain from interstitial cystitis is hard to cure because part of the pain comes from the nervous system (the brain and nerves).",
        "If you’ve been struggling with burning sensations in your bladder, frequent trips to the bathroom, and pain during sex, you might wonder why there’s no quick fix for your symptoms. Unlike a bladder infection, which can be treated with an antibiotic that resolves the symptoms in days, IC is more complicated to treat. That’s why it’s important to find a holistic treatment provider who understands the factors that contribute to IC.",
        "1. The Pain From Interstitial Cystitis Is Different",
        "Interstitial cystitis is difficult to treat because much of the pain arises from the nervous system. The medical term is nociplastic pain . It occurs when the body’s attempt to heal from an injury, infection, or other problem goes awry. Inflammation spreads to the nerves and disrupts the normal processing of pain signals. Over time, typically months, the nerves become abnormally sensitive to stimuli. Pain comes on faster and lasts longer. Pain continues even after the original injury has resolved."

A score of 40 or higher on the CSI (within a range of 0 to 100) suggests a significant number of symptoms are from nervous system pain. The inventory is available for free at the link above. After completing it, show the provider treating your IC so they may tailor your treatment.",
        "3. Procedures Don’t Work for Nervous System Pain",
        "Proper pain treatment depends on the pain type you have. Procedures work well for many types of pain, but not nervous system pain. Procedures and surgeries may worsen this pain type because the nerves are hyper-sensitive. Procedures treat the bladder, not the nervous system. In my experience, when the CSI score is higher than 40, procedures may not be helpful and often worsen symptoms."
