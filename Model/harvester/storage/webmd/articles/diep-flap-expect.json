        "DIEP is one type of flap surgery. It stands for deep inferior epigastric perforator and is named for an artery that runs through your abdomen, or lower belly.",
        "DIEP flap “involves using tissue from the lower abdomen and utilizing microsurgery, surgically connecting small blood vessels to establish a blood supply for the tissue that is moved from the abdomen to the chest, to create a new breast,” explains Neelesh Kantak, MD, Chief of Plastic Surgery for Mid-Atlantic Permanente Medical Group.",
        "Your surgeon will take skin, fat, and blood vessels, but no muscles, from your lower belly above your pubic bone. This is sometimes called the “ tummy tuck ” area.",
        "Using your own tissue often creates more natural results. And you can avoid the complications that can come with breast implants.",

You might find it painful to change positions, such as going from standing to sitting or vice versa. But you should be able to manage the pain, and it should lessen over time. If not, talk to your doctor."
