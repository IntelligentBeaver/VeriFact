In most cases, these tests offer reassurance that everything is going smoothly, and many of them are meant to spot problems, such as iron deficiency or diabetes, that can be treated before complications occur.",

They are intended to determine if you are at higher-than-usual risk and may call for additional diagnostic tests that carry some risk to the fetus, although the odds of a healthy baby are still high -- only about 2% to 3% of all babies are born with a genetic defect."

During the procedure, a device is moved across the abdomen that transmits sound waves to create an image of the uterus and fetus on a computer monitor.

This test measures your blood-sugar level an hour after you've had a glass of soda. If the reading is high, which happens about 20% of the time, you'll take a more sensitive glucose-tolerance test, in which you drink a glucose solution on an empty stomach and have your blood drawn once every hour for three hours.",
        "Amniocentesis: This optional diagnostic test is usually performed between 15 and 18 weeks (but can be done earlier) for women who are 35 or older, have a higher-than-usual risk of genetic disorders, or whose AFP or multiple-marker screen test results were suspicious. The procedure is done by inserting a needle through the abdomen into the amniotic sac and withdrawing fluid that contains fetal cells. Analysis can detect neural tube defects and genetic disorders. The miscarriage rate varies depending on the experience of the physician, averaging about 0.2% to 0.5% at 15 weeks and 2.2% at 11 to 14 weeks, but the test can detect 99% of neural-tube defects and almost 100% of certain genetic abnormalities."
