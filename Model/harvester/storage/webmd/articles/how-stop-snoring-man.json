        "Sometimes I snore like a steam shovel, other times more like a teakettle. This \"gentle, unromantic music of the nose,\" as William Makepeace Thackeray called it, is the nighttime soundtrack in many homes. For most of us, snoring is no more than an irritant to those trying to sleep within range. But for 12 million American men, the cause of snoring is an invisible, though not-so-silent, epidemic -- obstructive sleep apnea , a cessation of breathing during sleep.",
        "We snore -- about half of adult men snore, according to studies -- for one of two reasons. Mostly we snore because our airways narrow in sleep , creating resistance in the passageways that connect our nose and mouth to the lungs . The narrower the tube, the greater amount of pressure needed to establish enough flow. The fatter we are -- and in particular, the thicker our necks -- the more pressure there is on the airways, and the more they tend to collapse as we sleep.",
        "A small percentage of men have a structural problem, a small jaw or a \"shallow midface\" -- the area between your nostrils and the back of your head -- which can cause snoring even in thin men. In either case, the more suction pressure on the soft tissues of the mouth, the more vibration and the more snoring."

        "In the 1990s, a snoring surgery that involved \"lasering off\" bits of flesh from the soft palate of the mouth was popular. But this turned out largely to be a disaster because \"it doesn't necessarily unblock your breathing. You decrease the snoring sounds -- the feedback to patient and bed partner is that they don't snore. But they might still have obstruction,\" says Strollo.",

After the surgery, the patient is required to wear a retainer for 18 months. Strollo recommends it in fewer than 5% of the patients he sees.",
