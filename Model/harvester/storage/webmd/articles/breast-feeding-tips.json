        "\"I strongly believe that a new mom should stay at home with her baby and that help should come to her, so I do home visits,\" Mason says. \"I come when the baby is awake and I can make a good assessment and observe the baby nursing. I stay for about 1 and a half hours. During this time, I gather information from Mom, observe the baby nursing and latching on, and then provide Mom with a plan of action to address her breastfeeding questions and concerns.\"",
