But when your breast cancer is described as HER2-positive, it means the cancer cells have more HER2 protein than usual. Since this protein can make cancer cells grow more quickly, it’s natural to worry that your HER2-positive breast cancer might spread, or “metastasize.” If breast cancer spreads to other parts of your body, doctors call it “metastatic.” That means it’s at a more advanced stage than if it’s only in your breasts."

        "Any type of breast cancer can spread. This happens when cancer cells get into healthy cells around the breast. If they spread, cancer cells usually go to other parts of the breast first. Lymph nodes near the breast tend to be the next place cancer cells go. From there, cancer cells can travel to other parts of the body farther from the breast. About one in every five breast cancers are HER2-positive. This means they have extra copies of a gene that makes the HER2 protein. HER2-positive breast cancer can grow and spread faster than other breast cancers because HER2 protein speeds that growth."
