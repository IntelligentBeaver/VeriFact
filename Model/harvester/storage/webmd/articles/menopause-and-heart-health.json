Generally speaking, levels of LDL-cholesterol (“bad” cholesterol) increase while HDL-cholesterol (“good” cholesterol) declines after menopause, upping the chances for clogged arteries that block the flow of blood to your heart, brain, and legs. Get your cholesterol tested every 4 to 6 years, or more often if you’re at higher risk. If you’re over age 20, total cholesterol should be under 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). Aim for an LDL less than 100 mg/dl and HDL levels of 60 mg/dl or higher.",

This is the type that surrounds your internal organs and contributes to high blood pressure, elevated blood cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes -- all risk factors for heart disease. If you carry more weight around the middle, you have a greater chance for heart attack than if you’re just heavier overall. If your waist measures 35 inches or more, you probably have extra visceral fat."

Some research suggests that they’re also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Tell your doctor if you’re having frequent or persistent hot flashes, or if you did during perimenopause."
