        "Gallstones are crystal-like deposits that develop in the gallbladder -- a small, pear-shaped organ that stores bile, a digestive fluid produced by the liver .",
        "These deposits may be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball; they may be hard or soft, smooth or jagged. You may have several gallstones or just one.",
        "Some 30 million American adults suffer from gallstones. Yet most of those who have the condition do not realize it. In this case, what you don't know probably won't hurt you; gallstones that are simply floating around inside the gallbladder generally cause no symptoms and no harm.",
        "These \"silent\" stones usually go unnoticed unless they show up in an ultrasound exam conducted for some other reason. However, the longer a stone exists in the gallbladder, the more likely it is to become problematic. People who have gallstones without symptoms have a 20% chance of having an episode of pain during their lifetime.",
        "When symptoms do occur, it's usually because the gallstone has moved and become lodged within a duct that carries bile, such as the cystic duct, a small conduit that connects the gallbladder to another tube called the common bile duct. The typical symptom is abdominal pain , perhaps accompanied by nausea , indigestion , or fever . The pain, caused by the gallbladder's contraction against the lodged stone, generally occurs within an hour of eating a large meal or in the middle of the night. Stones can also clog the common bile duct, which carries bile into the small intestine, and the hepatic ducts, which take bile out of the liver ."
