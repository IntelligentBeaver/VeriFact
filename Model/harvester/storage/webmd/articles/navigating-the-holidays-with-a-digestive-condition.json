        "This should obviously be a priority all year long, but you’ll want to pay special attention to it right now. The holidays tend to be prime time for stress, which is known to worsen many digestive conditions. Exercise, including walking, is a smart choice since it both reduces stress and helps keep your GI system moving. Try to let go of what most exhausts you about the holidays, whether that’s attending every function or sending holiday cards. And don’t be afraid to cancel or postpone something if you just don’t feel well.",

Many of the common culprits for people with digestive issues tend to be everywhere during the holidays, such as alcohol and high-fat dishes. Mocktails are trendy right now, so consider ordering an alcohol-free drink. If you feel pressured by a host to eat something you know is a problem food for you, ask to take some home instead (where you can either share or toss it)."

They may even offer to modify the menu – most people are more than happy to make accommodations for loved ones.
