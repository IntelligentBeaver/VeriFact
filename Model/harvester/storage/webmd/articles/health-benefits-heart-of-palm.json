        "Heart of palm is a white vegetable that comes from the core of certain kinds of palm trees. It's also called palm hearts, palm cabbage, palmito, chonta, and swamp cabbage. Heart of palm grows in humid and tropical areas such as Costa Rica and the Amazon. Farmers harvest the vegetable by cutting down a palm tree and cutting away its outer bark and layers, leaving the tree's tender inner core.",
        "Most people don't eat heart of palm fresh. Even in countries where it's cultivated, the vegetable is usually boiled and processed before eating because it goes bad quickly. Heart of palm is typically exported internationally in pickled form and comes in jars or cans.",
        "Because hearts of palm contain 17 different amino acids, they make for a rich source of protein. They're also low in fat and sugar, high in fiber , and have several healthy vitamins and minerals."
