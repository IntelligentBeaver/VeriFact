Cover your nose and mouth in public. If you have COVID-19, you can spread it even if you don't feel sick. Wear a mask to protect others. This isn't a replacement for social distancing. You still need to keep a 6-foot distance between yourself and those around you.

Wash your hands often with soap and water or clean them with an alcohol-based sanitizer. This kills viruses on your hands.
Don't touch your face. Coronaviruses can live on surfaces you touch for several hours. If they get on your hands and you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, they can get into your body.
Practice social distancing. Because you can have and spread the virus without knowing it, you should stay home as much as possible. If you do have to go out, stay at least 6 feet away from others.
Clean and disinfect. You can clean first with soap and water, but disinfect surfaces you touch often, like tables, doorknobs, light switches, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Use a mix of household bleach and water (1/3 cup bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water) or a household cleaner that's approved to treat SARS-CoV-2.

Cover your nose and mouth in public. If you have COVID-19, you can spread it even if you don't feel sick. Wear a mask to protect others. This isn't a replacement for social distancing. You still need to keep a 6-foot distance between yourself and those around you. Don't put a face covering on anyone who is: Under 2 years old Having trouble breathing Unconscious or can't remove the mask on their own for other reasons
Wash your hands often with soap and water or clean them with an alcohol-based sanitizer. This kills viruses on your hands.
Don't touch your face. Coronaviruses can live on surfaces you touch for several hours. If they get on your hands and you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, they can get into your body.
Practice social distancing. Because you can have and spread the virus without knowing it, you should stay home as much as possible. If you do have to go out, stay at least 6 feet away from others.
Clean and disinfect. You can clean first with soap and water, but disinfect surfaces you touch often, like tables, doorknobs, light switches, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Use a mix of household bleach and water (1/3 cup bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water) or a household cleaner that's approved to treat SARS-CoV-2.

Morgan,"Mahammad  Juber, MD",2025-09-15,"People first used the word “pandemic” in 1666. Some notable pandemics over time include:
Bubonic plague. It's also called the Black Death or the Plague. It happened in Europe, Asia, and Africa from 1346 to 1353 and is considered the deadliest and worst pandemic in history. The disease spread to people from fleas on rats. About 200 million people died.
Cholera. Cholera has caused several pandemics dating back to the 1800s. Cholera spreads through contaminated water or food. The disease has killed millions of people, with more than a billion now at risk around the world.
Spanish flu. The 1918 flu pandemic started in Kansas from an H1N1 influenza strain that came from birds. It killed so many young people that it dropped the average life expectancy to just 12 years.
Asian flu. Starting in China in 1957, an H2N2 influenza virus caused this pandemic. It also came from a bird strain and spread to the U.S., England, and Scotland fast. By 1958, it had killed more than a million people.
Hong Kong flu. An H3N2 influenza virus caused this outbreak, starting in Hong Kong in 1968. It quickly spread to the U.S. and other places, killing up to 4 million people.
HIV/AIDS. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has killed 36 million people and continues to infect millions around the world. While there's no cure for HIV , medicines can now control the infection and keep it from spreading.
SARS. This pandemic was caused by a coronavirus related to the one that causes COVID-19. It started in 2002 in China and spread to 29 countries, killing 774 people. The pandemic ended in 2003.
Swine flu. In 2009, swine flu started spreading to infect about 1 in 10 people. The H1N1 influenza virus that caused it started in Mexico and mostly affected teens and young adults.
MERS. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which emerged in 2012, spreads to people from camels. Since 2012, 27 countries have reported MERS cases, with a combined toll of more than 850 deaths.
Ebola. This hemorrhagic fever arose first in Guinea in 2013. Ebola is now a rare but very deadly disease, which can spread to people from other animals or people.
COVID-19. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 showed up first in China in late 2019. It quickly spread to other countries. WHO declared it a pandemic in March 2020. Before the pandemic emergency ended 3 years later, the virus had killed more than 2 million people.",0.9359127283096313,0.924373984336853,2026-01-28T13:48:53.118724

Wash your hands often with soap and water or clean them with an alcohol-based sanitizer. This kills viruses on your hands.
Don't touch your face. Coronaviruses can live on surfaces you touch for several hours. If they get on your hands and you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, they can get into your body.
Practice social distancing. Because you can have and spread the virus without knowing it, you should stay home as much as possible. If you do have to go out, stay at least 6 feet away from others.
Clean and disinfect. You can clean first with soap and water, but disinfect surfaces you touch often, like tables, doorknobs, light switches, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Use a mix of household bleach and water (1/3 cup bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water) or a household cleaner that's approved to treat SARS-CoV-2.

An epidemic is the spreading of a disease that outpaces what would be expected within a certain time and location. A pandemic is an epidemic that spreads across various continents and regions of the world. COVID-19 is a new virus, which makes things tricky. “Before 2020, our baseline was zero because COVID-19 didn't exist,” says Vasan. “So, the question we can't really answer from an epidemiologic standpoint is – ‘is it still a pandemic?’ Well, is it circulating beyond what's to be expected? I think we're going to have to figure out what those expectations are at baseline.” Jim Versalovic, MD, pathologist-in-chief at Texas Children’s Hospital, deems this a “post-pandemic” period, since the virus isn’t impacting us as dramatically as it did in 2020 and 2021.

But you should also take these steps:
Cover your nose and mouth in public. If you have COVID-19, you can spread it even if you don't feel sick. Wear a mask to protect others. This isn't a replacement for social distancing. You still need to keep a 6-foot distance between yourself and those around you. Don't put a face covering on anyone who is: Under 2 years old Having trouble breathing Unconscious or can't remove the mask on their own for other reasons
Wash your hands often with soap and water or clean them with an alcohol-based sanitizer. This kills viruses on your hands.
Don't touch your face. Coronaviruses can live on surfaces you touch for several hours. If they get on your hands and you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, they can get into your body.
Practice social distancing. Because you can have and spread the virus without knowing it, you should stay home as much as possible. If you do have to go out, stay at least 6 feet away from others.
Clean and disinfect. You can clean first with soap and water, but disinfect surfaces you touch often, like tables, doorknobs, light switches, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Use a mix of household bleach and water (1/3 cup bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water) or a household cleaner that's approved to treat SARS-CoV-2.

Bubonic plague. It's also called the Black Death or the Plague. It happened in Europe, Asia, and Africa from 1346 to 1353 and is considered the deadliest and worst pandemic in history. The disease spread to people from fleas on rats. About 200 million people died.
Cholera. Cholera has caused several pandemics dating back to the 1800s. Cholera spreads through contaminated water or food. The disease has killed millions of people, with more than a billion now at risk around the world.
Spanish flu. The 1918 flu pandemic started in Kansas from an H1N1 influenza strain that came from birds. It killed so many young people that it dropped the average life expectancy to just 12 years.
Asian flu. Starting in China in 1957, an H2N2 influenza virus caused this pandemic. It also came from a bird strain and spread to the U.S., England, and Scotland fast. By 1958, it had killed more than a million people.
Hong Kong flu. An H3N2 influenza virus caused this outbreak, starting in Hong Kong in 1968. It quickly spread to the U.S. and other places, killing up to 4 million people.
HIV/AIDS. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has killed 36 million people and continues to infect millions around the world. While there's no cure for HIV , medicines can now control the infection and keep it from spreading.
SARS. This pandemic was caused by a coronavirus related to the one that causes COVID-19. It started in 2002 in China and spread to 29 countries, killing 774 people. The pandemic ended in 2003.
Swine flu. In 2009, swine flu started spreading to infect about 1 in 10 people. The H1N1 influenza virus that caused it started in Mexico and mostly affected teens and young adults.
MERS. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which emerged in 2012, spreads to people from camels. Since 2012, 27 countries have reported MERS cases, with a combined toll of more than 850 deaths.
Ebola. This hemorrhagic fever arose first in Guinea in 2013. Ebola is now a rare but very deadly disease, which can spread to people from other animals or people.
COVID-19. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 showed up first in China in late 2019. It quickly spread to other countries. WHO declared it a pandemic in March 2020. Before the pandemic emergency ended 3 years later, the virus had killed more than 2 million people.",0.95,0.8702762126922607,2026-01-28T14:00:04.918190

Cover your nose and mouth in public. If you have COVID-19, you can spread it even if you don't feel sick. Wear a mask to protect others. This isn't a replacement for social distancing. You still need to keep a 6-foot distance between yourself and those around you. Don't put a face covering on anyone who is: Under 2 years old Having trouble breathing Unconscious or can't remove the mask on their own for other reasons
Wash your hands often with soap and water or clean them with an alcohol-based sanitizer. This kills viruses on your hands.
Don't touch your face. Coronaviruses can live on surfaces you touch for several hours. If they get on your hands and you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, they can get into your body.
Practice social distancing. Because you can have and spread the virus without knowing it, you should stay home as much as possible. If you do have to go out, stay at least 6 feet away from others.
Clean and disinfect. You can clean first with soap and water, but disinfect surfaces you touch often, like tables, doorknobs, light switches, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Use a mix of household bleach and water (1/3 cup bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water) or a household cleaner that's approved to treat SARS-CoV-2.

Cover your nose and mouth in public. If you have COVID-19, you can spread it even if you don't feel sick. Wear a mask to protect others. This isn't a replacement for social distancing. You still need to keep a 6-foot distance between yourself and those around you.

Wash your hands often with soap and water or clean them with an alcohol-based sanitizer. This kills viruses on your hands.
Don't touch your face. Coronaviruses can live on surfaces you touch for several hours. If they get on your hands and you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, they can get into your body.
Practice social distancing. Because you can have and spread the virus without knowing it, you should stay home as much as possible. If you do have to go out, stay at least 6 feet away from others.
Clean and disinfect. You can clean first with soap and water, but disinfect surfaces you touch often, like tables, doorknobs, light switches, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Use a mix of household bleach and water (1/3 cup bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water) or a household cleaner that's approved to treat SARS-CoV-2.

It has also amplified social divisions and has made it harder for many people to separate fact from fiction and to distinguish big risks from small ones.

This will increase blood flow to the brain to prevent future stroke. Your doctor may suggest either of the following procedures:
Carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This has been the commonly performed procedure for patients who have carotid atherosclerosis and TIAs or mild strokes. While you’re under general anesthesia, an incision is made in the neck at the location of the blockage. The surgeon isolates the artery and surgically removes the plaque and diseased portions of the artery. Then, the artery is sewn back together to allow improved blood flow to the brain. The risks and benefits of CEA depend on your age, the degree of blockage, and whether you’ve had a stroke or TIA.
Carotid artery stenting (CAS). Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a newer treatment option. It’s less invasive than carotid endarterectomy and is performed in a catheterization laboratory. With CAS, a small puncture is made in the groin. A specially designed catheter is threaded to the area of narrowing in the carotid artery. Once in place, a small balloon tip is inflated for a few seconds to open the artery. Then, a stent is placed in the artery and expanded to hold the artery open. A stent is a small tube that acts as a scaffold to provide support inside your artery. The stent is usually made of metal and is permanent. It can also be made of a material that the body absorbs over time. Some stents have medicine that helps keep the artery from getting blocked again. CAS is a newer procedure, and there is still some controversy as to how well it prevents strokes caused by carotid artery disease. Research suggests that the standard CEA may be safer than CAS, which may raise the risk of stroke or death post-procedure.",0.9406347274780273,0.9952704310417175,2026-01-28T14:09:13.929718

These neuromodulation devices modulate, or change, activity in your brain to stop pain signals. While they don't work for everyone, they're thought to be safe and cause few side effects. Several types are available, such as: External trigeminal nerve stimulation (ETNS). Using electrical impulses transmitted through an electrode, this therapy gently stimulates a nerve along your forehead called the trigeminal nerve. Some studies suggest an hour of treatment with ETNS can significantly improve headache pain for people with migraine. Regular use may help to prevent migraine attacks. You can get an ETNS device without a prescription and use it at home. But talk to your doctor before you try one. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). These devices use magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in your brain via a coil placed on your scalp. Research shows that TMS may relieve pain and reduce the frequency of migraine attacks. You need a prescription for a TMS device. You can get these treatments in a doctor's office or with devices you use at home. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). These devices, applied to the side of your neck, deliver electrical impulses to your vagus nerve . This long nerve regulates many body functions, like mood, heart rate, digestion, and immune responses. Studies suggest VNS may lessen migraine pain and also prevent future attacks. You'll need a prescription for VNS therapy. But one handheld device lets you can do the treatments yourself. Implantable occipital nerve stimulation. This kind of device, which a surgeon implants at the base of your skull, sends electrical pulses to your occipital nerve. The therapy works to prevent headaches for some, but not all, people with migraine. One study found it was effective in a little less than half of those who used it. Remote electrical neuromodulation (REN). You wear a REN device on your upper arm. You use a phone app to control the device, which targets part of your nervous system that’s involved in pain control. Some studies show it can lessen migraine pain within a couple of hours. Multi-channel brain neuromodulation . You get this therapy via a device you wear as a headset. It targets six branches of the occipital and trigeminal nerves in your head. You control it through your smartphone. Studies have shown it can relieve head pain as well as other symptoms like light and noise sensitivity.",0.95,0.9990736246109009,2026-01-28T14:11:01.672777

Topical treatments . Some medications in the form of creams, rubs, or sprays may be applied to the skin of affected areas to relieve pain and inflammation .
Exercise: Physical activity can improve joint movement and strengthen the muscles that surround the joints. Gentle exercises, such as swimming or walking on flat surfaces, are recommended because they create less stress on joints. Activities that increase joint pain ( jogging , high-impact aerobics , etc.) should be avoided. If you have arthritis, talk to your doctor to find out the best exercise routine for you.
Weight control : Losing weight can prevent extra stress on weight-bearing joints.
Prescription anti-inflammatory pain relievers: These help reduce pain and swelling in the joints.
Hyaluronic Acid Injections: These medications can be given as injections to relieve pain in some people with osteoarthritis. Medications include Euflexxa, Hyalgan, Orthovisc, Supartz, Synvisc, and Synvisc-One.
Duloxetine ( Cymbalta ): Originally approved as an antidepressant , Cymbalta is also used to fight various forms of pain, including osteoarthritis pain.
Hot or cold compresses: These treatments may be given in the form of a hot shower or bath, or by applying heating pads or cold compresses.
Joint protection devices: These can help prevent strain or stress on painful joints.
Integrative therapy: Acupuncture has been shown to help relieve pain. While research is conflicting, there is some evidence that the supplement glucosamine and chondroitin may relieve some pain in some people with osteoarthritis, especially in the knee.

Not everyone may need or want to take medicine for Parkinson’s, especially in the early stages. Talk to your doctor about exercise, physical and speech therapy, and other treatments that could help your symptoms.
Ask your doctor about other types of Parkinson’s medicines. Options include a type of antidepressant called MAO-B inhibitors, dopamine agonists, anticholinergic agents, and COMT inhibitors. But these drugs don’t work as well as levodopa and have side effects, too.
If you get dyskinesia, you and your doctor have a few treatment options. One is a medicine called amantadine ( Gocovri , Osmolex ER ). It might also help to lower your dose of levodopa or take it less often. Another is clozaril ( Clozapine ), a drug typically used to treat mood disorders. The trick is to take enough to control your Parkinson's symptoms but not enough to cause dyskinesia. You could also try taking an extended-release form of levodopa.

But it adds other mental strategies that can be especially helpful when symptoms worsen, such as:
Staying flexible: This can mean changing the way you think of normal. A good sense of humor and a positive outlook can help a lot when you’re dealing with some of the serious issues that MS can throw your way.
Planning ahead: There are serious practical challenges that can arise with MS. You can help lessen the challenges and the anxiety that goes along with them if you plan for them. For example, as you start to become less mobile, you can slowly work toward making your home easier to navigate by wheelchair.
Seeking meaning: This can mean involvement in your community through outreach, hobbies, or religious organizations. Or it may be time together with friends and family.

If you have moderate or severe symptoms, you may need surgery for relief. Options include:
Myomectomy. This surgery takes out fibroids while trying to leave healthy tissue alone. This might be your best option if you hope to become pregnant in the future. There are multiple ways to do a myomectomy , from major abdominal surgery to laparoscopy (surgery done through one or more small cuts instead of one large one).
Endometrial ablation. A surgeon uses either a laser, wire loops, boiling water, an electric current, microwaves, or freezing to remove or destroy the lining of your uterus. You may be able to have this minor surgery as an outpatient. Typically, you’ll stop having periods afterward, and you'll no longer be able to get pregnant.
Uterine fibroid embolization (UFE), or uterine artery embolization (UAE). In this procedure, a doctor blocks the flow of blood to your fibroids by inserting gel or plastic particles into the nearby blood vessels. This makes the fibroids shrink.
Hysterectomy. This surgery removes your uterus completely. This is the only way to cure fibroids entirely. It’s a major surgery, but your doctor has options for how to do it, including cutting through your belly or even laparoscopy .",0.9498949646949768,0.790282130241394,2026-01-28T14:13:55.718437

Cut back on processed and fast foods. They tend to be higher in calories and fat. Instead, fill your child’s plate with fruits and vegetables , and trade white bread, rice, and pasta for their whole-grain versions. They have fiber, which can help your child feel full for longer. If your kid isn’t a fan of these changes at first, don’t give up. Research shows that children are more likely to eat something after they’ve seen it on their plates a few times.
Don’t serve sugary drinks. Swap soda, juice, and sports drinks for water and skim or low-fat milk.
Encourage good eating habits. Three meals and two snacks a day can keep your child from getting too hungry, which make them less likely to overeat.
Make small changes. Overhauling your family’s diet all at once can leave your child upset or confused.

Urine tests check for blood in your urine or other signs of problems.
Blood tests show how well your kidneys are working.
Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) involves X-raying your kidneys after the doctor injects a dye that travels to your urinary tract, highlighting any tumors.
Ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of your kidneys. It can help tell if a tumor is solid or fluid-filled.
A CT scan uses X-rays and a computer to create a series of detailed pictures of your kidneys. This may also require an injection of dye. CT scans have virtually replaced pyelogram and ultrasound as a tool for diagnosing kidney cancer.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of soft tissues in your body. You may need an injection of a contrast agent to create better pictures.

Kidney biopsy. This is a test where kidney tissue is removed and then looked at under a microscope. It is the only way to definitely prove that you have interstitial nephritis, but it is performed in rare cases to see if corticosteroids should be prescribed.

The number of seeds and their locations are determined by a computer-generated treatment plan for each patient. The seeds remain in place permanently and become inactive after a period of months. HDR brachytherapy is a newer treatment and involves the temporary placement of hollow needles in the prostate. These are filled with a radioactive substance for a period of minutes and then removed. This is repeated two to three more times over several days.",0.95,0.9065066576004028,2026-01-28T14:16:24.487404

Boost your intake of omega-3 fatty acids. You can get these healthy fats by taking fish oil supplements and eating fish. They may help reduce inflammation in the glomeruli and don’t cause harmful side effects. You can buy supplements over the counter, but talk to your doctor before taking them.
Keep your blood pressure in check. Having a healthy blood pressure can help slow down kidney damage. Take your medications the way your doctor prescribes. You can also improve your blood pressure through diet, especially by reducing your salt intake and avoiding excess alcohol. Losing excess weight and getting regular exercise are also helpful. You should also keep track of your blood pressure numbers by monitoring them at home.
Eat less protein. Eating too much protein can make your kidneys work too hard and speed up the worsening of your IgA nephropathy. But before you cut back, check with your doctor or nutritionist to be sure you get enough. Eating too little protein can cause malnutrition.
Eat less salt. Too much salt can increase your blood pressure and cause more protein to spill into the urine.
Avoid harmful meds. This can include over-the-counter meds such as NSAIDs, as well as certain prescription medications. Talk to your doctor before starting any new medicine.
Quit smoking. Along with slowing down blood flow to your kidneys, smoking can affect how well your blood pressure medications work.

One new study shows women with HER2-positive early breast cancer were able to be successfully treated without chemotherapy thus avoiding its harsh side effects. HER2 positive breast cancer is not that common, and diagnosed in about 1 in 5 women with breast cancer. It means that the cancer cells have additional copies of the gene producing the HER2 protein, and this cancer type tends to be more aggressive than others.

Johnson, MD",2024-02-11,"Treatment of a STD during pregnancy depends on how far the infection has progressed and how far along you are in your pregnancy. Many bacterial STDs like syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia are treated with antibiotics given as a shot or taken by mouth . Below are common treatments for STDs in pregnant women and newborns:
HIV/AIDS: Medications can reduce the HIV virus to such a low level, as in an undetectable viral load. You can prevent transmitting the virus to your baby by taking several medications.
Herpes: Your doctor can prescribe antiviral pills to treat these lesions. Women with active herpes lesions at delivery will likely have a C-section to prevent transmitting the infection to the baby.
Gonorrhea: Pregnant women with the infection can be treated with antibiotics. Because gonorrhea is often without symptoms, all newborns are given medications in their eyes at birth to prevent development of the gonorrhea eye infection.
HPV (Genital Warts): If you contract genital warts during pregnancy, treatment may be delayed until after you deliver. Although the virus never leaves the body, the warts can be treated with surgery or medications . Small warts require no treatment, while larger, more bothersome, ones may be treated by chemical burning with acids or by cutting them away.
Chlamydia: Mothers with chlamydia are treated with antibiotics. The drug used on all newborns to prevent a gonorrhea eye infection also prevents chlamydia from infecting the eye, but it can't prevent the pneumonia that may develop later. Even if you have been treated, you should be retested within 3 months to ensure the infection is truly gone, even if your partner has been treated. During pregnancy you should not use the antibiotic doxycycline because it can discolor your baby's teeth . Ointment is now routinely put in the eyes of newborns to prevent conjunctivitis due to a mother’s chlamydia infection, which can lead to blindness if not treated.
Syphilis: Your doctor will prescribe antibiotics during your pregnancy to decrease risk of transmitting the infection to your baby and stop the syphilis from progressing in you.
Hepatitis B: If you have hepatitis B, your doctor will give your newborn an injection of antibodies to prevent them from becoming infected.
Trichomoniasis: Pregnant women can be treated with medication to cure the infection. Your partner should also be treated at the same time to prevent reinfection and further spread of the disease. You should get retested after 3 months to be certain the infection is gone, even if your partner has been treated.",0.95,0.9961044788360596,2026-01-28T14:19:04.763184

These drugs work by blocking estrogen’s effect. Still others target the vascular system and block development of blood vessels that help feed the cancer cells.,0.95,0.9956125020980835,2026-01-28T14:20:25.716591

When they are used, which is rare, there are two main types of implants to control pain:
Intrathecal Drug Delivery. Also called infusion pain pumps or spinal drug delivery systems. The surgeon makes a pocket under the skin that's large enough to hold a medicine pump. The pump is usually about one inch thick and three inches wide. The surgeon also inserts a catheter, which carries pain medicine from the pump to the intrathecal space around the spinal cord. The implants deliver medicines such as morphine or a muscle relaxant directly to the spinal cord , where pain signals travel. For this reason, intrathecal drug delivery can provide significant pain control with a fraction of the dose that would be required with pills. In addition, the system can cause fewer side effects than oral medications because less medicine is required to control pain.
Spinal Cord Stimulation Implants. In spinal cord stimulation , low-level electrical signals are transmitted to the spinal cord or to specific nerves to block pain signals from reaching the brain. This method being especially used for back and limb pain. In this procedure, a device that delivers the electrical signals is surgically implanted in the body. A remote control is used by the patient to turn the current off and on or to adjust the intensity of the signals. Some devices cause what’s described as a pleasant, tingling sensation while others do not. Two kinds of spinal cord stimulation systems are available. Partial and totally implanted units. The unit that is more commonly used is fully implanted. The latter system's antenna and transmitter are carried outside the body, while the receiver is implanted inside the body",0.9448753595352173,0.5758181214332581,2026-01-28T14:20:56.548780

The following is a common strategy, but ask your doctor exactly what you should do to help prevent breast cancer or find it early:
Have a medical checkup and mammogram on a regular basis. The American Cancer Society recommends women ages 40 to 44 should have a choice to start yearly screening mammograms if they would like. Women ages 45 to 54 should have a mammogram each year, and those 55 years and over should continue getting mammograms every 1 to 2 years. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends every-other-year mammograms beginning at age 40 through age 74. Talk to your doctor about when you should have your first mammogram.
If you use contraception, ask your doctor about the pros and cons of birth control pills .
If you are near or in menopause, ask your doctor if you should use hormone replacement therapy to treat menopause symptoms. Studies suggest that hormone replacement, especially therapies with a combination of estrogens and progestins, can increase the risk of breast cancer. You and your doctor can make this decision based on your risk of breast cancer.
If you are at high risk for breast cancer, certain drugs that block the effects of estrogen , such as raloxifene and tamoxifen , have been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer. Drugs called aromatase inhibitors, including anastrozole (Arimidex) and exemestane (Aromasin), have also been shown to lower breast cancer risk in post-menopausal women.

Gardner, MD",2025-04-17,"Treatments for moderate to severe cases of psoriasis include:
Biologic treatments. These work by blocking the body's immune system (which is overactive in psoriasis) to better control the systemic inflammation linked to psoriasis. Biologic medications include adalimumab ( Humira ), brodalumab ( Siliq ), certolizumab (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), guselkumab (Tremfya), infliximab (Remicade), ixekizumab (Taltz), risankizumab-rzaa (Skyrizi), secukinumab ( Cosentyx ), tildrakizumab (Ilumya), and ustekinumab (Stelara).
Light therapy. A doctor uses ultraviolet light to slow the growth of skin cells. PUVA is a treatment that combines a medicine called psoralen with a special form of ultraviolet light.
Enzyme Inhibitor. The medication apremilast (Otezla) is a new kind of drug for long-term inflammatory diseases like psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis . It's a pill that works by blocking a specific enzyme, which helps to slow other reactions that lead to inflammation. D eucravacitinib (Sotyktu) may also be prescribed as an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
Methotrexate. This drug can cause liver disease and lung problems, so it’s only for serious cases. Doctors closely watch patients. You may have to get lab work, a chest X-ray, and possibly a liver biopsy.
Cyclosporine. This drug, made to suppress the immune system, may be taken for serious cases that do not respond to other treatments. It can damage the kidneys and raise blood pressure , though, so your doctor will closely watch your health while you take it.
Retinoids. These pills, creams, foams, and gels are a class of drugs related to vitamin A . Retinoids can cause serious side effects, including birth defects, so they’re not recommended for women who are pregnant or planning to have children.
Aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist. Tapinarof ( Vtama ) is a new steroid-free topical cream that is an aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist, approved to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Applied once a day, it can be used on sensitive areas of the body and is safe for long-term use.",0.937157154083252,0.9846618175506592,2026-01-28T14:21:21.378456
