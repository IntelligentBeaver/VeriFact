Are there clinical trials I can participate in? What are the risks and benefits of each treatment? Will the cancer be surgically removed? Will I need treatment before surgery? How will you decide about my cancer treatment before and after surgery? How long will I have to undergo each treatment? What type of side effects might I experience, and what can I do to minimize them?",

Does it have doorways wide enough for a wheelchair, handrails, and other safety features you need with MS? Does it offer social and recreational activities that interest you?\nAdmission.

Have fees gone up lately?\nStaff. Do they have experience with MS? Are they willing to work with your current care team? How available are they? How do they interact with residents?\nMedication and health care. What’s the policy on storing medication and helping residents take it? How do they coordinate therapy visits? Does a doctor or nurse visit the residents regularly to give checkups? How do they handle an emergency?\nFood service. What’s the food like? Do they accommodate special diets?

It's important to find a doctor who you and your child feel comfortable with and trust. It's helpful to understand any medicine your doctor prescribes for your child, including how it works and what side effects it might cause. Here are some questions to ask your doctor when they prescribe any new medication: Why did you recommend this medicine? How does it work in the brain? Is it a stimulant or non-stimulant? What are the alternatives? How much does it cost, and will our insurance cover it? Are any generic versions available? When and how should my child take the medicine? With food or without? How often will you monitor my child while they take the medicine? How long should it take to start working? What kind of improvement can we expect? What are the possible side effects? What should I do if my child has side effects or the medicine isn't working? For how long will my child need to stay on it? How should my child come off the medicine? Can they just stop taking it, or do they need to taper off slowly? Expect to see the doctor about once every three to six months for follow-up visits. At these appointments, the doctor will check your child's height, weight, heart rate, and blood pressure. They'll ask whether ADHD symptoms have improved and if your child has had side effects from the treatment.",

    "text": "Here are the answers to the following questions:\nHow dangerous is the radiation from the damaged Japanese nuclear reactors?\nOn April 11, a month after the disaster, Japan raised the radiation alert status to its highest level, level 7 -- the same as the Chernobyl plant meltdown in Russia. It had previously been at level 5. What does this new status mean?\nIsn’t it bad that radiation is leaking into the ocean?\nWhat kind of radiation is coming from the plant?\nAre radiation-contaminated foods being imported from Japan?\nCould radiation from Japan's nuclear plants affect the U.S.?\nWhat is the best way to prevent radiation exposure?\nShould I take potassium iodide pills?\nWhat are the health effects of radiation?\nIs it safe to visit Japan?\nWhat does it mean for a nuclear plant to melt down?\nCould the nuclear disaster in Japan happen in the U.S.?",

Are there clinical trials I can participate in? What are the risks and benefits of each treatment? Will the cancer be surgically removed? Will I need treatment before surgery? How will you decide about my cancer treatment before and after surgery? How long will I have to undergo each treatment? What type of side effects might I experience, and what can I do to minimize them?",

For prescribed infusions, is the medication and infusion covered? Are they covered at an infusion site and for home infusion? Are they covered as durable medical equipment or as a prescription? Are supportive therapies like physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and behavioral health covered? Are non-traditional therapies like acupuncture covered? Is durable medical equipment covered? Are repairs covered? Does my plan have a copay accumulator or maximizer program? If your plan has a copay accumulator or maximizer program, it means any deductibles, copay, and coinsurance costs paid on your behalf don’t count toward your deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. So if you get financial assistance from a drug manufacturer, foundation, or charity, the payments don’t go toward lowering your deductible, nor are they tallied as part of your out-of-pocket maximum.",

You may want to schedule an introductory visit to meet with the healthcare provider you are considering and determine if you feel comfortable with him or her. Here are some questions to ask during your meeting:\nHow long have you been in practice?\nWhen and where did you receive training?\nAre you board-certified?\nDo you have professional or patient references?\nWhat are your general philosophies about pregnancy, labor, and delivery? Think about how they fit in with your own beliefs.\nHow many babies do you deliver per week?\nWhat is your cesarean delivery rate?\nAre you in a group practice? If so, will I see every provider with whom you rotate during my doctor visits? Do I have a choice about whom I see and who delivers my baby? Note that there are no guarantees that a specific healthcare provider will deliver your baby since no provider is available 24 hours a day; make sure you know the other providers in the practice or the providers with whom the doctor shares delivery responsibility.\nWho will I see at each appointment?\nWill you be in town around my due date ? Note that there are no guarantees that a specific healthcare provider will deliver your baby since no provider is available 24 hours a day; make sure you know the other providers in the practice or the providers with whom the doctor shares delivery responsibility.\nIf I have a question, who do I call? Who responds to the calls? Do you accept questions via email?\nAm I allowed to write a personal birth plan? A personal birth plan is a written agreement between you and your doctor as to how your baby will be delivered. It gives the parents more of a role in the decision-making process; however, the plan is no guarantee that your birthing process will go as planned because complications can arise. If there are problems, your doctor will make decisions based on what is safest for you and your baby.\nWhat is your policy on inducing labor if I go beyond my due date?",

    "text": "A psychiatrist, pediatrician, or primary care doctor will prescribe ADHD medicines and monitor your child while they’re on them. It's important to find a doctor who you and your child feel comfortable with and trust. It's helpful to understand any medicine your doctor prescribes for your child, including how it works and what side effects it might cause. Here are some questions to ask your doctor when they prescribe any new medication: Why did you recommend this medicine? How does it work in the brain? Is it a stimulant or non-stimulant? What are the alternatives? How much does it cost, and will our insurance cover it? Are any generic versions available? When and how should my child take the medicine? With food or without? How often will you monitor my child while they take the medicine? How long should it take to start working? What kind of improvement can we expect? What are the possible side effects? What should I do if my child has side effects or the medicine isn't working? For how long will my child need to stay on it? How should my child come off the medicine? Can they just stop taking it, or do they need to taper off slowly? Expect to see the doctor about once every three to six months for follow-up visits. At these appointments, the doctor will check your child's height, weight, heart rate, and blood pressure. They'll ask whether ADHD symptoms have improved and if your child has had side effects from the treatment.",
