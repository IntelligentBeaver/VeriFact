As a result, there’s growing interest in using “magic mushrooms” to treat different types of depression, including major depressive disorder, treatment-resistant depression, and depression tied to a physical illness. Studies show that medically supervised treatment with psilocybin is generally safe, well-tolerated, and eases depression symptoms for people who haven’t responded to other treatments. But psychedelic drugs haven’t been approved by the FDA to treat any mental health condition. Here’s what research has found so far: A single 25-milligram dose eased depression for some people within eight days. Two doses eased depression for at least a year when paired with talk therapy. Repeat doses are linked to more symptom improvement. Psilocybin works well to ease depression due to a life-threatening illness.	0.95	0.9835303425788879	2026-01-27T14:06:33.153243

Alyftrek is approved to treat people ages 6 and older who have the genetic condition called cystic fibrosis . Cystic fibrosis happens because of a change in a gene on chromosome 7. This gene is responsible for making a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which helps control the movement of salt and water in the body. Cystic fibrosis changes the way chloride (salt) moves through the cells of your body. This causes the mucus (which should be thin and slippery) in various organs to become thick and sticky, which can lead to infections, inflammation, problems with your organs, and electrolyte imbalances. Symptoms of cystic fibrosis can appear at any age from infancy to adulthood.	0.9183018803596497	0.99967360496521	2026-01-27T14:06:36.734348

Mirza, MD, as told to Rachel Reiff Ellis To understand how far we’ve come with geographic atrophy (GA), it’s important to start with the basics of the disease. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision impairment in older adults. There are two types: wet AMD, which is more aggressive, and dry AMD, which in its late stages can lead to GA. The treatment for wet AMD has been revolutionized during my career. When I was a resident, there was no wet AMD treatment that could improve your vision, only a thermal laser which burned areas of abnormal blood vessels in your eye. But then we developed photodynamic therapy to address abnormal blood vessels. Not long after, anti-VEGF treatments. Suddenly, I wasn’t seeing people with large areas of scarring anymore. The injections changed that. These developments with wet AMD are why I'm excited about the development of a new approach to dry AMD. Because we've seen how rapidly, and with such promise, innovation can come to those we treat.	0.9432839155197144	0.9339307546615601	2026-01-27T14:06:47.485772

But they do have other uses, including:
Heart attack long-term outcome. Your doctor may give you an hs-cTn test following your recovery from your heart attack. If your troponin level remains above normal, it means you have a higher risk of having another heart attack or other problem.
Unstable angina. Angina is chest pain that develops when your heart does not get enough oxygen-rich blood. The pain comes and goes. Unstable angina is a more dangerous type of angina that puts you at a high risk of getting a heart attack. A high-sensitivity troponin test can help diagnose and monitor unstable angina.
Heart failure. Research shows that high-sensitivity troponin tests can help doctors identify people at risk of heart failure even before they have symptoms of the disease. If you have heart failure, the test may be used to see if you're at risk of needing hospitalization for the condition.
Pulmonary embolism. This life-threatening condition develops when a clot breaks off from a vein -- often in one of your legs -- and travels to your lungs, where it blocks an artery and cuts off blood flow. An hs-cTn test is more likely to detect this condition than a standard test.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). High blood pressure in the arteries in your lungs puts strain on your heart and can lead to heart failure. Your doctor may use a troponin test when diagnosing PAH and determining your outlook.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD). Kidney disease can cause ongoing damage to your heart muscle. That keeps your troponin level elevated. And because your kidneys don’t work as well as they should, they may not be able to filter troponin out of your blood and into your urine. Tracking your troponin levels may help your doctor determine whether you are at risk of a heart attack or other heart problems.
Heart surgery follow-up. Damage to your heart muscle can occur during surgery. You may have an hs-cTn test before and after surgery. This can help your doctor compare the results of the tests and determine if any damage has occurred.
People without symptoms. If you're over 65 and have no symptoms of heart disease, regular hs-cTn testing may be useful. An increase of 50% or more in the result predicts heart failure. Your physician can prescribe treatment to help you."	0.9383130669593811	0.9026538729667664	2026-01-27T14:06:58.601453

As a result, each state has launched its own challenges to the legality of abortions and if they are allowed, at what stage of pregnancy. The laws continue to change quickly, so it’s hard to get an exact state-by-state count, but common restrictions include:
Complete ban on abortions
Banning abortions after a certain point in the pregnancy, including after the detection of a heartbeat (usually 6 weeks after the last period) or when the fetus can live outside the mother's womb. In many states, this threshold is 20 weeks. In some, it’s 24 weeks. Most states make exceptions if the mother’s life or health is in danger.
Requiring a licensed doctor to perform abortions
Waiting for an abortion, usually 24 hours, while you get counseling
Allowing individual health care providers to refuse to perform abortions
Allowing health care institutions to refuse to perform abortions
Allowing religious or private institutions to refuse to perform abortions

That can help slow down the amount of cholesterol that builds up in your arteries, lowering your chance of a heart attack or stroke. When you’ve had a cardiac event, doctors recommend high-intensity statin therapy. This therapy can lower your LDL cholesterol by 50% or more. In some cases, your doctors might add another cholesterol-lowering medication and suggest you make lifestyle changes like a heart-healthy diet and exercise more often.	0.95	0.9983912110328674	2026-01-27T14:08:11.062491

Omega-3 fatty acid. Omega-3 fish oil supplements have piqued great interest. Studies suggest that a higher intake of omega-3 fatty acid from foods such as cold-water fish, plant and nut oils, and English walnuts are strongly linked to a lower risk of Alzheimer's. However, thorough studies comparing omega-3s to placebo are needed to prove this memory benefit from supplements.
Huperzine A. Also known as Chinese club moss, this natural medicine works in a similar way as Alzheimer's drugs. But more evidence is needed to confirm its safety and effectiveness.
Acetyl-L-carnitine. Some studies suggest that this amino acid might help Alzheimer's patients with memory problems. It may provide a greater benefit to people with early onset and a fast rate of the disease.
Vitamin E . Although vitamin E apparently doesn't decrease the risk of developing Alzheimer's, it may slow its progression. Recent studies have raised concerns about an increased risk of deaths in unhealthy people who take high doses of vitamin E, so be sure to consult with your doctor before taking this supplement.
Asian (or Panax) ginseng. An herb that's sometimes used with ginkgo biloba, Asian ginseng may help with fatigue and quality of life, Fugh-Berman tells WebMD.

Morgan	Zilpah  Sheikh, MD	2024-01-15	"While a hantavirus may be the most devastating disease spread by rodent urine and feces, it is not the only one. Other diseases that are endemic to the U.S. and spread by rats or their droppings include:
Leptospirosis. A bacteria that spreads through the body fluids of infected animals, leptospirosis is most often caused by exposure to contaminated water, but humans can also be infected through the mucous membranes or cuts in the skin. Symptoms vary widely and can include belly problems, chills, fever, jaundice , and headaches. But some infected people show no symptoms at all.
Lymphocytic chorio meningitis (LCM). LCM is caused by exposure to the droppings, urine, or saliva of an infected rodent. While it is usually carried by the common house mouse, any rodent can become a carrier. The illness begins with flu-like symptoms but can get worse, causing encephalitis, meningitis, or meningoencephalitis. It's rarely fatal, but getting LCM during pregnancy can cause serious and permanent birth defects or even fetal death.
Rat-bite fever (RBF). In North America, RBF is caused by the bacteria Streptobacillus moniliformis . The bacteria spreads through saliva via bites – as indicated by the common name – but can also spread through contact with the urine or feces of an infected rodent. RBF starts with flu-like symptoms but can quickly lead to infections throughout the body, which are fatal about 10% of the time."	0.95	0.9852805733680725	2026-01-27T14:10:42.767682

Gardner, MD	2025-06-20	"Many over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription treatments are available for people with eczema. You may work with your doctor and try several options to find the best medications for your skin . A health care professional may recommend one or more of the following:
Antihistamines : These block histamines, which cause allergy symptoms, like redness and itching. They are effective but may cause you to feel tired.
Antibiotics: Scratching your skin can introduce bacteria and cause a skin infection. Oral antibiotics get rid of this bacteria and can ease eczema symptoms. Take the entire course of antibiotics.
Biologics: These drugs block the source of inflammation that causes eczema. There are four biologics approved for eczema. They are dupilumab (Dupixent), lebrikizumab (Ebglyss), nemolizumab (Nemluvio), and tralokinumab (Adbry).
Calcineurin Inhibitors: These are immunosuppressant drugs that lead to a reduction in inflammation in conditions like eczema and rheumatoid arthritis. For eczema, they include pimecrolimus (Elidel) and tacrolimus (Protopic).
Corticosteroids : Prescription pills, creams, ointments, or shots that are used for more severe cases. This steroid type has serious side effects when used for long periods and is usually only used to stop a flare-up.
Cyclosporine : A medication that suppresses the immune system to prevent flare-ups. It can be taken as a pill or liquid. Talk to your doctor about potential side effects.
JAK Inhibitors : These oral and topical drugs – abrocitinib ( Cibinqo ), ruxolitinib (Opzelura), and upadacitinib ( Rinvoq ) – are used to treat chronic inflammatory disorders like atopic dermatitis . They work by suppressing enzymes that promote inflammation .
Methotrexate: This treatment is also an immunomodulator/immunosuppressant that can help manage eczema. But there is evidence it can harm the liver if used for long periods.
Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE-4 inhibitors) : These are drugs that suppress inflammation. These are FDA-approved for eczema: Zoryve cream and Eucrisa ointment .
Phototherapy: Light therapy relies on specific wavelengths of ultraviolet (UV) light to target the immune system and stop inflammation.
Topical steroid creams: An ointment or cream applied directly to the affected area to ease inflammation and swelling. Steroid creams, ointments, foams, lotions, and solutions come in different strengths. Overusing them can lead to discoloration and thinning of the skin.
AhR agonists. AhR is short for aryl hydrocarbon receptor. It can help to lower inflammation by activating AhR along with proteins that may help your skin barrier work better. The AhR agonist tapinarof ( Vtama ) is approved for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, which may include hand eczema. Studies have shown it can help clear your skin and ease itching."	0.9416713714599609	0.7670055627822876	2026-01-27T14:13:36.571415

Bisphosphonates Bisphosphonates are also called antiresorptives (anti-bone resorption drugs). If you already have low bone density or have had fractures from minor injuries, your doctor may recommend bisphosphonates. Some of the most commonly prescribed bisphosphonates for treating osteoporosis include: Alendronate (Binosto, Fosamax): One pill daily or weekly Risedronate (Actonel, Atelvia): One pill daily, weekly, or monthly Ibandronate: A monthly pill or an intravenous (IV) infusion every three months Zoledronic acid (Reclast): One annual IV infusion Anabolic medications Unlike bisphosphonates, which slow bone loss (resorption), anabolic medications help form new bone and are used in cases of advanced osteoporosis. Some of them include: Abaloparatide (Tymlos). A synthetic form of a natural hormone in the body (parathyroid hormone). You give yourself a daily injection in your abdomen. It helps create new bone and increases its density and strength. It isn’t typically used for more than two years.	0.95	0.9809858202934265	2026-01-27T14:14:16.421456

This is because their brains work differently from those of kids without ADHD: They develop more slowly and have fewer chemical messengers like dopamine and norepinephrine to relay the signals that regulate behavior and emotion. Stimulant and non-stimulant ADHD medications work by increasing levels of these chemicals. Medicine is just one part of an ADHD treatment strategy. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends treating children ages 6 and older with a combination of medication and behavioral therapies. Every child is unique and responds differently to treatment. Getting on the right medicine can take time.

Possible tests include the following:
Carotid ultrasound (standard or Doppler). This non-invasive, painless screening test uses high-frequency sound waves to view the carotid arteries. It looks for plaques and blood clots and determines whether the arteries are narrowed or blocked. A Doppler ultrasound shows the movement of blood through the blood vessels. Ultrasound imaging does not use X-rays.
Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This imaging technique uses a powerful magnet to gather accurate information about the brain and arteries. Then a computer uses this information to generate high-resolution images. An MRA can often detect even small strokes in the brain.
Computerized tomography angiography (CTA). More detailed than an X-ray, a CT uses X-rays and computer technology to produce cross-sectional images of the carotid arteries. Images of the brain can be collected as well. With this imaging test, the scan may reveal areas of damage on the brain. The CT scan uses a low level of radiation .
Cerebral angiography (carotid angiogram). This procedure is considered the gold standard for imaging the carotid arteries. It is an invasive procedure that lets a doctor see blood flow through the carotid arteries in real-time. Cerebral angiography allows the doctor to see narrowing or blockages on a live X-ray screen as contrast dye is injected into the carotid arteries. This procedure provides the best information. It does carry a small risk of serious complications."	0.9407241344451904	0.808040201663971	2026-01-27T14:16:38.429293

Morgan Griffin	Louise  Chang, MD		"The list of diseases is impressive, but Ertl and other experts say that most of these vaccines are in very early stages of development. Here are a few examples of therapeutic vaccines being studied.
HIV. Researchers have been looking for a therapeutic HIV vaccine for decades, but they have made some progress. One approach had researchers loading dendritic cells with killed AIDS viruses and then injecting them back into the person, triggering an effective immune response. In one 2004 study of 18 people injected with the vaccine, the amount of virus in the blood dropped by 80%. After one year, eight of the people still had a 90% drop in their viral levels.
Alzheimer's Disease . One experimental vaccine for Alzheimer's disease may help the immune system attack a protein that plays a key role in the illness. By getting the immune system to attack the protein, the vaccine might slow down the progress of the illness. A study of the vaccine was suspended in 2002, when 6% of the subjects developed brain inflammation. However, researchers kept tracking the people who received the vaccines. After a year, about 20% of the people were making antibodies to the protein, meaning that their immune system was attacking it. This group also scored slightly better on memory tests than people who had not received the vaccine.
Cancer. A cancer vaccine has been the Holy Grail for many immunologists, and dozens of vaccines have been tested in dozens of types of cancer. Vaccines are being developed for breast cancer , colorectal cancer , kidney cancer , leukemia , lung cancer , lymphoma , melanoma , ovarian cancer , prostate cancer , and pancreatic cancer , among others. One prostate cancer vaccine, Provenge, was shown to lengthen the life of men with widespread disease. It also is a dendritic vaccine -- dendritic cells are taken from a man, ""taught"" to recognize tumor cells, and reinjected into the body. In a group of 127 men with metastatic prostate cancer, the men who received the vaccine lived four and a half months longer than the men who didn't. One vaccine that will help prevent cervical cancer , Gardasil, is likely to be approved by the FDA soon. Studies show that Gardasil will block the underlying cause of 70% of all cervical cancers. Another similar HPV vaccine , Cervarix, is also in the pipeline. However, these aren't truly therapeutic vaccines -- they work by preventing infection with a virus (HPV or human papillomavirus) that can lead to cervical cancer."	0.9307556748390198	0.3322949707508087	2026-01-27T14:19:06.718878

Used for thousands of years, capsaicin has antimicrobial and pain-relieving properties and may support heart health, weight loss, and pain management by interacting with TRPV1 nerve receptors throughout the body. You'll mainly find capsaicin in hot peppers and supplements such as cayenne. It's also an active ingredient in many topical pain relief products. Although generally safe, it can cause side effects such as nausea, acid reflux, or digestive upset, especially in those who aren't used to it.

When you apply it topically to your skin, capsaicin can help with pain by reducing the amount of a chemical messenger known as substance P, which travels to your brain to signal discomfort. With less substance P, you feel less pain. The FDA has approved topical capsaicin treatment for certain kinds of nerve pain, and research on capsaicin injections to relieve arthritis pain is promising.	0.9490518569946289	0.951796293258667	2026-01-27T14:19:32.846364

Your body makes its own vitamin D when you’re exposed to the sun, but about half of people worldwide don’t get enough. It’s in fatty fish, fortified milk, and cereals, but not many other foods. Vitamin D is important for bone and immune health and helps with nerve signaling. It’s generally safe, but too much can cause vomiting, weakness, or constipation. It can interact with medications like statins or steroids. Breastfed babies should take extra because human breastmilk doesn’t contain much. What to look for: Adults up to age 70 should get 600 IU (international units) daily. People over 70 should get 800 IU a day.

Gardner, MD	2025-06-20	"Many over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription treatments are available for people with eczema. You may work with your doctor and try several options to find the best medications for your skin . A health care professional may recommend one or more of the following:
Antihistamines : These block histamines, which cause allergy symptoms, like redness and itching. They are effective but may cause you to feel tired.
Antibiotics: Scratching your skin can introduce bacteria and cause a skin infection. Oral antibiotics get rid of this bacteria and can ease eczema symptoms. Take the entire course of antibiotics.
Biologics: These drugs block the source of inflammation that causes eczema. There are four biologics approved for eczema. They are dupilumab (Dupixent), lebrikizumab (Ebglyss), nemolizumab (Nemluvio), and tralokinumab (Adbry).
Calcineurin Inhibitors: These are immunosuppressant drugs that lead to a reduction in inflammation in conditions like eczema and rheumatoid arthritis. For eczema, they include pimecrolimus (Elidel) and tacrolimus (Protopic).
Corticosteroids : Prescription pills, creams, ointments, or shots that are used for more severe cases. This steroid type has serious side effects when used for long periods and is usually only used to stop a flare-up.
Cyclosporine : A medication that suppresses the immune system to prevent flare-ups. It can be taken as a pill or liquid. Talk to your doctor about potential side effects.
JAK Inhibitors : These oral and topical drugs – abrocitinib ( Cibinqo ), ruxolitinib (Opzelura), and upadacitinib ( Rinvoq ) – are used to treat chronic inflammatory disorders like atopic dermatitis . They work by suppressing enzymes that promote inflammation .
Methotrexate: This treatment is also an immunomodulator/immunosuppressant that can help manage eczema. But there is evidence it can harm the liver if used for long periods.
Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE-4 inhibitors) : These are drugs that suppress inflammation. These are FDA-approved for eczema: Zoryve cream and Eucrisa ointment .
Phototherapy: Light therapy relies on specific wavelengths of ultraviolet (UV) light to target the immune system and stop inflammation.
Topical steroid creams: An ointment or cream applied directly to the affected area to ease inflammation and swelling. Steroid creams, ointments, foams, lotions, and solutions come in different strengths. Overusing them can lead to discoloration and thinning of the skin.
AhR agonists. AhR is short for aryl hydrocarbon receptor. It can help to lower inflammation by activating AhR along with proteins that may help your skin barrier work better. The AhR agonist tapinarof ( Vtama ) is approved for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, which may include hand eczema. Studies have shown it can help clear your skin and ease itching."	0.95	0.9675595760345459	2026-01-27T14:20:14.136376

It may depend on what’s causing or triggering your chronic hand eczema and its symptoms. It also will depend on whether your hand eczema symptoms are mild, moderate, or more severe, and how much they’re impacting your life and ability to work or do other everyday activities. You’ll likely start with basic steps you can take at home or at work and topical therapies first. If topical therapies and other steps you can take to protect your hands aren’t working, talk to your doctor about systemic medicines you could try for your hand eczema.	0.95	0.7620781064033508	2026-01-27T14:20:16.155251

Some basic things you might buy over-the-counter or try at home to help with your hand eczema include: Ice packs or cold compresses Petroleum jelly Moisturizing creams containing more oil than water Bleach baths Wet wraps Trigger avoidance, including wearing gloves when doing wet work or handling irritants Existing treatments doctors may use for hand eczema include: Topical steroids (corticosteroids) Topical calcineurin inhibitors Topical phosphodiesterase inhibitors Topical aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) modulators Oral steroids Retinoids IL inhibitors JAK inhibitors Biologics The best choice of medication for you may depend on whether you have signs of eczema or atopic dermatitis on other parts of your body or not. It may depend on what’s causing or triggering your chronic hand eczema and its symptoms. It also will depend on whether your hand eczema symptoms are mild, moderate, or more severe, and how much they’re impacting your life and ability to work or do other everyday activities. You’ll likely start with basic steps you can take at home or at work and topical therapies first. If topical therapies and other steps you can take to protect your hands aren’t working, talk to your doctor about systemic medicines you could try for your hand eczema.	0.95	0.7111890316009521	2026-01-27T14:20:18.332059

Medication. Finasteride ( Proscar ) was one of the first drugs used to treat BPH by shrinking the prostate gland. Dutasteride ( Avodart ) is another similar drug that can be used for the same purpose. They both work by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to the hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which affects the growth of the prostate gland. These medications appear to be most helpful for men with larger prostates. The FDA has revised labels on Proscar and Avodart to include a warning that the drugs, while capable of reducing overall prostate cancer risk by 25%, may be linked to an increased risk of an unusual type of aggressive or high-grade prostate cancer. More common are drugs referred to as alpha blockers that relax the muscle in the prostate to reduce the tension on the urine tube. These include alfuzosin (Uroxatral), doxazosin (Cardura XL), silodosin (Rapaflo), tamsulosin (Flomax), and terazosin ( Hytrin ). Side effects may include light-headedness and weakness. Taking both a DHT inhibitor and an alpha blocker at the same time can be more beneficial at controlling symptoms and preventing the progression of BPH than taking either drug individually. Other medications may be effective for some men. These may include anticholinergics when symptoms of overactive bladder are present, and PDE-5 inhibitors such as tadalafil ( Cialis ) if erectile dysfunction is also a problem.
Surgery . A number of surgery types can remove the prostate tissue blocking the flow of urine. The most common is called transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP. It involves removing the tissue blocking the urethra (urine tube) with a special instrument. Although TURP is effective, side effects may include bleeding, infection, impotence (inability to maintain an erection suitable for sex), and incontinence (inability to control the flow of urine). Another, less complicated procedure is transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP). Instead of removing tissue, as with TURP, this approach involves widening the urethra by making several small cuts in the bladder neck (area where the urethra and bladder join), as well as in the prostate gland itself. This relieves some of the pressure on the urethra and improves urine flow.
Minimally invasive treatments . Newer treatments can effectively reduce the size of the prostate and relieve urinary obstruction, but are less invasive and damaging to healthy tissue than surgery. In general, less invasive procedures require less time in the hospital, result in fewer side effects, are less costly, and allow for quicker recovery. Side effects may be urinary frequency and irritation while the prostate is healing. However, many of these techniques are new. Little is known about the long-term effectiveness and complications of these procedures, which include: Transurethral Microwave Thermotherapy (TUMT). Microwave energy delivers temperatures above 45 degrees C (113 F) to the prostate by way of an antenna positioned in the prostate using a special catheter (tube). Cool water circulates around the catheter which protects the urethra and helps keep you reasonably comfortable throughout the procedure. The entire procedure is computer-controlled, based on temperature recordings obtained in the urethra and rectum. This technique is performed in your doctor's office and takes approximately 90 minutes. Patients are generally given medicine to prevent pain and relieve anxiety . The most common complaints during the treatment are an urge to urinate and a burning sensation in the penis . There are two programs: ""standard treatment"" or ""high-energy"" treatment. High-energy treatment delivers more energy to the prostate, which generally provides better results and improved flow, but patients may have more side effects in the recovery period. Interstitial Laser Coagulation . ILC uses a specially designed laser fiber to deliver heat to the interior of the prostate. The laser fiber is inserted into the prostate using instruments placed in the urethra. The procedure is usually done in the operating room, under anesthesia to numb the pain but not put you to sleep . This technique allows the surgeon to view the prostate directly and to treat specific areas of enlargement. Transurethral Needle Ablation (TUNA). This technique uses low-level radiofrequency energy delivered through two small needles to ablate, or burn away, an area of the enlarged prostate . Transurethral Electrovaporization. This technique uses electrical energy applied through an electrode to rapidly heat prostate tissue, turning the tissue cells into steam. This allows the doctor to vaporize an area of the enlarged tissue and relieve urinary obstruction. Laser photo-vaporization can also be performed. Intraurethral stents . Stents (wire devices shaped like springs or coils) are placed within the prostate channel (where the urethra runs through the gland) to help keep the channel from tightening around the urethra. Prostatic Urethral Lift. A prostatic urethral lift (PUL) is a permanent implant used to treat BPH. The PUL is placed in the urethra and works by pulling back the prostate tissue that is pressing on the urethra and impeding urine flow. Studies have shown improvement in symptoms in many men for up to five years or more."	0.9462507963180542	0.9953312277793884	2026-01-27T14:20:22.983954

Only 1 in 10 people who need palliative care receive it worldwide. This will be a growing problem as the global population ages. By 2060, the need for palliative care is expected to nearly double. A poll by The John A. Hartford Foundation found that while 96% of U.S. adults over age 50 think it is important to have access to palliative care when it’s defined for them, more than half (55%) are unfamiliar with the term. The familiarity with palliative care is even lower among Black adults over age 50, with 70% slightly or not at all familiar with the term, compared to 55% of Hispanic and 53% of White adults. Lack of awareness stems from health care providers not talking enough about palliative care before a serious illness happens or in the early stages of serious illness. Fifty-four percent of respondents shared that no health care professional started a conversation about what matters to them in their health. Organizations are working to change this, but patients and family caregivers can act now. Asking your health care providers about palliative care as soon as you or a family member receives a diagnosis of any serious illness can help you get the right care when it’s needed.	0.9478451609611511	0.4666139483451843	2026-01-27T14:20:48.400280

It has also amplified social divisions and has made it harder for many people to separate fact from fiction and to distinguish big risks from small ones. For many Americans, political messaging and misinformation have framed the debate over COVID-19 vaccinations as being more about liberty and freedom than public health, which helps explain why nearly 4 in 10 Americans remain unvaccinated , says Rupali Limaye, PhD, a social and behavioral scientist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore."	0.9363665580749512	0.9278379678726196	2026-01-27T14:22:23.268528

Certain strains of HPV are linked to cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, and rectum. Other strains cause genital warts. Genital warts are usually not a major health risk, and there are several ways to treat them. Your doctor may suggest a topical medication or a procedure to remove genital warts. Getting treatment right away can reduce the symptoms of genital warts, which can include itching and discomfort. Once you have HPV, the infection itself can't be treated. But a vaccine can prevent HPV in those who haven't been infected yet. The CDC recommends vaccination for people through age 26. Children's vaccines are generally scheduled at age 11 or 12, but the vaccine is safe for those as young as 9.	0.95	0.990279495716095	2026-01-27T14:23:32.090201

As a result, there’s growing interest in using “magic mushrooms” to treat different types of depression, including major depressive disorder, treatment-resistant depression, and depression tied to a physical illness. Studies show that medically supervised treatment with psilocybin is generally safe, well-tolerated, and eases depression symptoms for people who haven’t responded to other treatments. But psychedelic drugs haven’t been approved by the FDA to treat any mental health condition. Here’s what research has found so far: A single 25-milligram dose eased depression for some people within eight days. Two doses eased depression for at least a year when paired with talk therapy. Repeat doses are linked to more symptom improvement. Psilocybin works well to ease depression due to a life-threatening illness.	0.9441331624984741	0.9993452429771423	2026-01-27T14:25:08.602799

There’s building evidence for the use of psychedelic drugs to treat major depression. Drugs like psilocybin, commonly known as mushrooms, and LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) can change the properties in your brain chemistry that are involved in depression. Microdoses or millidoses of these drugs can be very effective, either by themselves or when used with antidepressants. They can improve symptoms, behavior, and function. They tend to be fast-acting, but for some people the effects don’t last long. Psychedelics are still viewed with relative stigma and they’re a controlled substance. It’s necessary to find the right microdose and schedule for the best effect. Not all clinicians are skilled, comfortable, or willing to provide psychedelic drugs. Another drawback is that people may try to self-medicate, which is very difficult. This is a very specific method that requires clinical skill.	0.9424261450767517	0.8639796376228333	2026-01-27T14:25:09.934349

If you have moderate or severe symptoms, you may need surgery for relief. Options include:
Myomectomy. This surgery takes out fibroids while trying to leave healthy tissue alone. This might be your best option if you hope to become pregnant in the future. There are multiple ways to do a myomectomy , from major abdominal surgery to laparoscopy (surgery done through one or more small cuts instead of one large one).
Endometrial ablation. A surgeon uses either a laser, wire loops, boiling water, an electric current, microwaves, or freezing to remove or destroy the lining of your uterus. You may be able to have this minor surgery as an outpatient. Typically, you’ll stop having periods afterward, and you'll no longer be able to get pregnant.
Uterine fibroid embolization (UFE), or uterine artery embolization (UAE). In this procedure, a doctor blocks the flow of blood to your fibroids by inserting gel or plastic particles into the nearby blood vessels. This makes the fibroids shrink.
Hysterectomy. This surgery removes your uterus completely. This is the only way to cure fibroids entirely. It’s a major surgery, but your doctor has options for how to do it, including cutting through your belly or even laparoscopy ."	0.9498949646949768	0.790282130241394	2026-01-27T14:25:56.696707

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were launched in the mid to late 1980s. This generation of antidepressants is now the most common class used for depression. Examples include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva), fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem), and sertraline (Zoloft). Two medicines, classified as ""serotonin modulators and stimulators"" or SMS's (meaning they have some similar properties as SSRIs but also affect other brain receptors) are vilazodone (Viibryd) and vortioxetine ( Trintellix ) Side effects are generally mild, but can be bothersome in some people. They include nausea, stomach upset, sexual problems, fatigue, dizziness , insomnia, weight change, and headaches.
Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are a newer type of antidepressant. This class includes venlafaxine (Effexor), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq and Khedezla), duloxetine (Cymbalta), and, levomilnacipran ( Fetzima ). Side effects include upset stomach, insomnia , sexual problems, anxiety, dizziness, and fatigue.
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were some of the first medications used to treat depression. Examples are amitriptyline , desipramine (Norpramin), doxepin (Adapin, Sinequan), imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), protriptyline (Vivactil), and trimipramine (Surmontil). Side effects include stomach upset, dizziness, dry mouth, changes in blood pressure, changes in blood sugar levels , and nausea.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) were among the earliest treatments for depression. The MAOIs block an enzyme, monoamine oxidase, that then causes an increase in brain chemicals related to mood, such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. Examples are phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate), isocarboxazid (Marplan), and transdermal selegiline (the EMSAM skin patch). Although MAOIs work well, they're not prescribed very often because of the risk of serious interactions with some other medications and certain foods. Foods that can negatively react with the MAOIs include aged cheese and aged meats.
Other medications: Bupropion (Aplenzin, Forfivo XL, Wellbutrin) is a unique antidepressant that is thought to affect the brain chemicals norepinephrine and dopamine. Side effects are usually mild, including upset stomach, headache, insomnia, and anxiety. Bupropion may be less likely to cause sexual side effects than other antidepressants. Esketamine (Spravato) is a unique medicine originally developed as an anesthetic and thought to treat depression, though its effects on a brain chemical called glutamate. It is administered as a nasal spray and is for use in those who have not responded to treatment by other antidepressants. Its most common side effects include sedation, dissociation (having strange perceptions about time and space, or feeling as if things around you are not real), problems with thinking, and high blood pressure. If any of these side effects occur they are usually mild and temporary. Mirtazapine (Remeron) is also a unique antidepressant that is thought to affect mainly serotonin and norepinephrine through different brain receptors than other medicines. It is usually taken at bedtime because it often causes drowsiness. Side effects are usually mild and include sleepiness, weight gain, elevated triglycerides , and dizziness. Trazodone is usually taken with food to reduce the chance of stomach upset. Other side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, dry mouth, and blurry vision. It is often prescribed to help with sleep."	0.9484815001487732	0.575562596321106	2026-01-27T14:26:09.555374

This will increase blood flow to the brain to prevent future stroke. Your doctor may suggest either of the following procedures:
Carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This has been the commonly performed procedure for patients who have carotid atherosclerosis and TIAs or mild strokes. While you’re under general anesthesia, an incision is made in the neck at the location of the blockage. The surgeon isolates the artery and surgically removes the plaque and diseased portions of the artery. Then, the artery is sewn back together to allow improved blood flow to the brain. The risks and benefits of CEA depend on your age, the degree of blockage, and whether you’ve had a stroke or TIA.
Carotid artery stenting (CAS). Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a newer treatment option. It’s less invasive than carotid endarterectomy and is performed in a catheterization laboratory. With CAS, a small puncture is made in the groin. A specially designed catheter is threaded to the area of narrowing in the carotid artery. Once in place, a small balloon tip is inflated for a few seconds to open the artery. Then, a stent is placed in the artery and expanded to hold the artery open. A stent is a small tube that acts as a scaffold to provide support inside your artery. The stent is usually made of metal and is permanent. It can also be made of a material that the body absorbs over time. Some stents have medicine that helps keep the artery from getting blocked again. CAS is a newer procedure, and there is still some controversy as to how well it prevents strokes caused by carotid artery disease. Research suggests that the standard CEA may be safer than CAS, which may raise the risk of stroke or death post-procedure."	0.9406347274780273	0.9952704310417175	2026-01-27T14:27:23.509231

Heart valve surgery. Diseased heart valves can be treated both surgically (traditional heart valve surgery) and nonsurgically (balloon valvuloplasty).
Implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD). The LVAD is known as the ""bridge to transplantation"" for patients who haven't responded to other treatments and are hospitalized with severe systolic heart failure. This device helps your heart pump blood throughout your body. It allows you to be mobile, sometimes returning home to await a heart transplant.

Studies are mixed on whether these nutrients make a difference; in the studies where they did show benefits, they shortened colds only by a day or two. Still, if you want to try, it can't hurt.

Your child -- and the whole family -- can eat healthier with a few simple steps:
Cut back on processed and fast foods. They tend to be higher in calories and fat. Instead, fill your child’s plate with fruits and vegetables , and trade white bread, rice, and pasta for their whole-grain versions. They have fiber, which can help your child feel full for longer. If your kid isn’t a fan of these changes at first, don’t give up. Research shows that children are more likely to eat something after they’ve seen it on their plates a few times.
Don’t serve sugary drinks. Swap soda, juice, and sports drinks for water and skim or low-fat milk.
Encourage good eating habits. Three meals and two snacks a day can keep your child from getting too hungry, which make them less likely to overeat.
Make small changes. Overhauling your family’s diet all at once can leave your child upset or confused. Start with a few changes each week. “Talk with your child about the choices you make,” says Mollie Greves Grow, MD, a pediatrician at Seattle Children’s Hospital.

Morgan Griffin	Louise  Chang, MD		"The list of diseases is impressive, but Ertl and other experts say that most of these vaccines are in very early stages of development. Here are a few examples of therapeutic vaccines being studied.
HIV. Researchers have been looking for a therapeutic HIV vaccine for decades, but they have made some progress. One approach had researchers loading dendritic cells with killed AIDS viruses and then injecting them back into the person, triggering an effective immune response. In one 2004 study of 18 people injected with the vaccine, the amount of virus in the blood dropped by 80%. After one year, eight of the people still had a 90% drop in their viral levels.
Alzheimer's Disease . One experimental vaccine for Alzheimer's disease may help the immune system attack a protein that plays a key role in the illness. By getting the immune system to attack the protein, the vaccine might slow down the progress of the illness. A study of the vaccine was suspended in 2002, when 6% of the subjects developed brain inflammation. However, researchers kept tracking the people who received the vaccines. After a year, about 20% of the people were making antibodies to the protein, meaning that their immune system was attacking it. This group also scored slightly better on memory tests than people who had not received the vaccine.
Cancer. A cancer vaccine has been the Holy Grail for many immunologists, and dozens of vaccines have been tested in dozens of types of cancer. Vaccines are being developed for breast cancer , colorectal cancer , kidney cancer , leukemia , lung cancer , lymphoma , melanoma , ovarian cancer , prostate cancer , and pancreatic cancer , among others. One prostate cancer vaccine, Provenge, was shown to lengthen the life of men with widespread disease. It also is a dendritic vaccine -- dendritic cells are taken from a man, ""taught"" to recognize tumor cells, and reinjected into the body. In a group of 127 men with metastatic prostate cancer, the men who received the vaccine lived four and a half months longer than the men who didn't. One vaccine that will help prevent cervical cancer , Gardasil, is likely to be approved by the FDA soon. Studies show that Gardasil will block the underlying cause of 70% of all cervical cancers. Another similar HPV vaccine , Cervarix, is also in the pipeline. However, these aren't truly therapeutic vaccines -- they work by preventing infection with a virus (HPV or human papillomavirus) that can lead to cervical cancer."	0.9442653059959412	0.37876230478286743	2026-01-27T14:31:17.793943

Electrodesiccation and curettage -- physically scraping away the skin cancer cells, followed by electrosurgery (heat destruction of tissue)
Cryosurgery or freezing -- You'll get this done in your doctor's office. They will use a spray, cotton swab, or metal device called a cryoprobe to apply extremely cold liquid nitrogen to the cancer. This freezes the cancer cells and the immediate surrounding cells. The frozen skin thaws and forms a scab, which eventually falls off, leaving a white scar.
Topical chemotherapeutic creams -- Your doctor will prescribe a cream, solution, or gel for you to use at home on an area of your skin where you have precancerous growths or directly on a skin cancer.

It can't tell you for sure whether your baby has one of those conditions. For that reason, some health professionals prefer to use the term noninvasive prenatal screening, or NIPS, rather than NIPT.	0.95	0.6461184620857239	2026-01-27T14:36:34.949321

Taking a statin may reduce your risk of diseases of your heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), strokes, or heart attacks. Each type of statin is available in different dosages. Generally, the higher the dosage, the more a statin will lower your LDL cholesterol levels. But some statins can bring your LDL to a certain level at a lower dose. Statin therapy is classified as low, moderate, or high intensity, depending on how much a certain drug can lower LDL at a given dosage. Your doctor will prescribe a statin based on your unique risk of cardiovascular disease. If your LDL cholesterol levels are high, but your heart is otherwise in good health, you may take a low- or moderate-intensity statin.

Some notable pandemics over time include:
Bubonic plague. It's also called the Black Death or the Plague. It happened in Europe, Asia, and Africa from 1346 to 1353 and is considered the deadliest and worst pandemic in history. The disease spread to people from fleas on rats. About 200 million people died.
Cholera. Cholera has caused several pandemics dating back to the 1800s. Cholera spreads through contaminated water or food. The disease has killed millions of people, with more than a billion now at risk around the world.
Spanish flu. The 1918 flu pandemic started in Kansas from an H1N1 influenza strain that came from birds. It killed so many young people that it dropped the average life expectancy to just 12 years.
Asian flu. Starting in China in 1957, an H2N2 influenza virus caused this pandemic. It also came from a bird strain and spread to the U.S., England, and Scotland fast. By 1958, it had killed more than a million people.
Hong Kong flu. An H3N2 influenza virus caused this outbreak, starting in Hong Kong in 1968. It quickly spread to the U.S. and other places, killing up to 4 million people.
HIV/AIDS. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has killed 36 million people and continues to infect millions around the world. While there's no cure for HIV , medicines can now control the infection and keep it from spreading.
SARS. This pandemic was caused by a coronavirus related to the one that causes COVID-19. It started in 2002 in China and spread to 29 countries, killing 774 people. The pandemic ended in 2003.
Swine flu. In 2009, swine flu started spreading to infect about 1 in 10 people. The H1N1 influenza virus that caused it started in Mexico and mostly affected teens and young adults.
MERS. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which emerged in 2012, spreads to people from camels. Since 2012, 27 countries have reported MERS cases, with a combined toll of more than 850 deaths.
Ebola. This hemorrhagic fever arose first in Guinea in 2013. Ebola is now a rare but very deadly disease, which can spread to people from other animals or people.
COVID-19. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 showed up first in China in late 2019. It quickly spread to other countries. WHO declared it a pandemic in March 2020. Before the pandemic emergency ended 3 years later, the virus had killed more than 2 million people."	0.949468195438385	0.7325660586357117	2026-01-27T14:38:25.470871

Cercek:	https://www.webmd.com/podcasts/20251009/why-are-more-younger-adults-facing-colorectal-cancer				Cercek: For rectal cancer, it's been great. You know, the NCCN guidelines, right, which are our kind of cancer treatment guidelines, now have a decision point when the patient is first diagnosed with early-stage rectal cancer to check for mismatch repair deficiency by immunohistochemistry. If the tumor is mismatch repair deficient, then they have an option of PD-1 blockade with either dostarlimab, which is the drug we used, pembrolizumab, or nivolumab. And then if it's MMR proficient, they undergo standard-of-care recommendations of total neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer. Currently, there was a global study called Asia One, which has completed accrual and is now in the process of data analysis, along with our study for FDA approval. So that is coming soon, I hope, and that will be very exciting—and also, hopefully, you know, extend to patients worldwide.	0.9347063899040222	0.49430912733078003	2026-01-27T14:38:48.684251

These medicines protect your bones and help your body lose less bone over time. Doctors call this pause a “drug holiday.” They recommend it to help you avoid side effects that can occur when taking bisphosphonates for too long. If you have osteoporosis, bisphosphonates help prevent fractures. They can lower your risk of spine fractures by up to 70%, other bone fractures by 40%, and hip fractures by 50%. “There are some very rare side effects linked to bisphosphonates. The risk is quite low, but it increases with prolonged and uninterrupted treatment,” says Elaine Yu, MD, director of the Bone Density Center at Massachusetts General Hospital. “To lower that risk, we recommend that patients consider taking a medication pause.” The FDA suggests that pausing treatment may not be a good idea if you are at high risk for fractures. These medications go a long way toward protecting your bones, and the side effects are usually minimal.	0.9401416778564453	0.9956560134887695	2026-01-27T14:39:10.598611

These include aromatase inhibitors (AIs), such as anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane (Aromasin), and letrozole (Femara). Because AIs cause a significant drop in estrogen levels, women who have this type of therapy may experience bone thinning. This can lead to osteoporosis and a higher risk of bone fractures. An estimated 10% to 20% of women taking hormone therapy for breast cancer experience a fracture after five years. If you take AIs, your doctor may suggest that you have bone density checked regularly and take medications to help keep your bones strong. These medications include denosumab (Prolia, Xgeva) and bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid (Zometa). Talk with your health care team about getting a bone density scan before you start treatment. This gives you a baseline you and your doctor can use to keep an eye on your bone health through treatment and beyond.	0.9332389831542969	0.4583754539489746	2026-01-27T14:39:12.088840

How did I get it? Why did I get it? Can I give it to someone else?’” he says. Jackson also says that because brain tumors can often affect kids’ ability to do their everyday activities, they’re eager to know when they can get back to “normal” and go to school, play sports, or do dance again.

Medication. Finasteride ( Proscar ) was one of the first drugs used to treat BPH by shrinking the prostate gland. Dutasteride ( Avodart ) is another similar drug that can be used for the same purpose. They both work by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to the hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which affects the growth of the prostate gland. These medications appear to be most helpful for men with larger prostates. The FDA has revised labels on Proscar and Avodart to include a warning that the drugs, while capable of reducing overall prostate cancer risk by 25%, may be linked to an increased risk of an unusual type of aggressive or high-grade prostate cancer. More common are drugs referred to as alpha blockers that relax the muscle in the prostate to reduce the tension on the urine tube. These include alfuzosin (Uroxatral), doxazosin (Cardura XL), silodosin (Rapaflo), tamsulosin (Flomax), and terazosin ( Hytrin ). Side effects may include light-headedness and weakness. Taking both a DHT inhibitor and an alpha blocker at the same time can be more beneficial at controlling symptoms and preventing the progression of BPH than taking either drug individually. Other medications may be effective for some men. These may include anticholinergics when symptoms of overactive bladder are present, and PDE-5 inhibitors such as tadalafil ( Cialis ) if erectile dysfunction is also a problem.
Surgery . A number of surgery types can remove the prostate tissue blocking the flow of urine. The most common is called transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP. It involves removing the tissue blocking the urethra (urine tube) with a special instrument. Although TURP is effective, side effects may include bleeding, infection, impotence (inability to maintain an erection suitable for sex), and incontinence (inability to control the flow of urine). Another, less complicated procedure is transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP). Instead of removing tissue, as with TURP, this approach involves widening the urethra by making several small cuts in the bladder neck (area where the urethra and bladder join), as well as in the prostate gland itself. This relieves some of the pressure on the urethra and improves urine flow.
Minimally invasive treatments . Newer treatments can effectively reduce the size of the prostate and relieve urinary obstruction, but are less invasive and damaging to healthy tissue than surgery. In general, less invasive procedures require less time in the hospital, result in fewer side effects, are less costly, and allow for quicker recovery. Side effects may be urinary frequency and irritation while the prostate is healing. However, many of these techniques are new. Little is known about the long-term effectiveness and complications of these procedures, which include: Transurethral Microwave Thermotherapy (TUMT). Microwave energy delivers temperatures above 45 degrees C (113 F) to the prostate by way of an antenna positioned in the prostate using a special catheter (tube). Cool water circulates around the catheter which protects the urethra and helps keep you reasonably comfortable throughout the procedure. The entire procedure is computer-controlled, based on temperature recordings obtained in the urethra and rectum. This technique is performed in your doctor's office and takes approximately 90 minutes. Patients are generally given medicine to prevent pain and relieve anxiety . The most common complaints during the treatment are an urge to urinate and a burning sensation in the penis . There are two programs: ""standard treatment"" or ""high-energy"" treatment. High-energy treatment delivers more energy to the prostate, which generally provides better results and improved flow, but patients may have more side effects in the recovery period. Interstitial Laser Coagulation . ILC uses a specially designed laser fiber to deliver heat to the interior of the prostate. The laser fiber is inserted into the prostate using instruments placed in the urethra. The procedure is usually done in the operating room, under anesthesia to numb the pain but not put you to sleep . This technique allows the surgeon to view the prostate directly and to treat specific areas of enlargement. Transurethral Needle Ablation (TUNA). This technique uses low-level radiofrequency energy delivered through two small needles to ablate, or burn away, an area of the enlarged prostate . Transurethral Electrovaporization. This technique uses electrical energy applied through an electrode to rapidly heat prostate tissue, turning the tissue cells into steam. This allows the doctor to vaporize an area of the enlarged tissue and relieve urinary obstruction. Laser photo-vaporization can also be performed. Intraurethral stents . Stents (wire devices shaped like springs or coils) are placed within the prostate channel (where the urethra runs through the gland) to help keep the channel from tightening around the urethra. Prostatic Urethral Lift. A prostatic urethral lift (PUL) is a permanent implant used to treat BPH. The PUL is placed in the urethra and works by pulling back the prostate tissue that is pressing on the urethra and impeding urine flow. Studies have shown improvement in symptoms in many men for up to five years or more."	0.9424790143966675	0.9949557185173035	2026-01-27T14:39:44.474274

Scientists are working on better tests using your blood and sputum (mucus in the lungs) to catch lung cancer early. There are two main areas they’re focusing on: Blood tests. Researchers are studying blood samples to see if they can find tumor cells or specific molecules that indicate lung cancer. This could help diagnose the disease sooner. Sputum tests. Scientists are examining spit samples for unusual cells or molecules that might show someone needs more testing for lung cancer. These advancements could lead to easier and earlier detection, making treatment for NSCLC more effective.	0.95	0.9976111650466919	2026-01-27T14:40:57.404504

It is specifically for people with IRD who have mutations in the RPE65 gene. This may be seen in two diseases: retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). The treatment delivers a functional copy of the RPE65 gene into the retinal cells of the eye. These cells then produce the normal protein that converts light to an electrical signal in the retina. This helps to slow down the progression of a patient’s disease and vision loss. Patients with these forms of IRD first find they have trouble seeing at night. They then begin to lose their peripheral, or side, vision, then finally, their central vision. During Luxturna’s clinical trials , researchers had patients go through a mobility maze both before and after treatment. Almost all of them saw significant improvements in their ability to get through the maze, even in a darker environment, which is usually more difficult. There have been some amazing stories of children whose vision has been restored by this procedure.	0.9393891096115112	0.7931575775146484	2026-01-27T14:41:00.828392

Biologic treatments. These work by blocking the body's immune system (which is overactive in psoriasis) to better control the systemic inflammation linked to psoriasis. Biologic medications include adalimumab ( Humira ), brodalumab ( Siliq ), certolizumab (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), guselkumab (Tremfya), infliximab (Remicade), ixekizumab (Taltz), risankizumab-rzaa (Skyrizi), secukinumab ( Cosentyx ), tildrakizumab (Ilumya), and ustekinumab (Stelara).
Light therapy. A doctor uses ultraviolet light to slow the growth of skin cells. PUVA is a treatment that combines a medicine called psoralen with a special form of ultraviolet light.
Enzyme Inhibitor. The medication apremilast (Otezla) is a new kind of drug for long-term inflammatory diseases like psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis . It's a pill that works by blocking a specific enzyme, which helps to slow other reactions that lead to inflammation. D eucravacitinib (Sotyktu) may also be prescribed as an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
Methotrexate. This drug can cause liver disease and lung problems, so it’s only for serious cases. Doctors closely watch patients. You may have to get lab work, a chest X-ray, and possibly a liver biopsy.
Cyclosporine. This drug, made to suppress the immune system, may be taken for serious cases that do not respond to other treatments. It can damage the kidneys and raise blood pressure , though, so your doctor will closely watch your health while you take it.
Retinoids. These pills, creams, foams, and gels are a class of drugs related to vitamin A . Retinoids can cause serious side effects, including birth defects, so they’re not recommended for women who are pregnant or planning to have children.
Aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist.

Exercise stress test. Your doctor records your heart activity, blood pressure , and other physical data while you raise your heart rate by walking on a treadmill or using a stationary bike.
Nuclear cardiac stress test. You may have special pictures taken of your heart after taking a stress test. Radioactive material is injected into your vein that helps show how well blood is flowing in your heart and whether parts of the heart muscle are damaged. The pictures will be compared to another set taken when your heart is at rest.
Cardiac catheterization. A surgeon inserts a thin tube into a blood vessel and threads it through to your heart, where they inject a special dye. Then they make an image called an angiogram that shows how your blood is moving and where there are blockages.
CT scan. Another way to get a look at how your blood is flowing is using a computer that turns X-rays of your heart into a 3D picture.
Coronary calcium scan. This is another kind of CT scan that measures the amount of calcium in the walls of your coronary arteries, which is an indication of disease.

Have a medical checkup and mammogram on a regular basis. The American Cancer Society recommends women ages 40 to 44 should have a choice to start yearly screening mammograms if they would like. Women ages 45 to 54 should have a mammogram each year, and those 55 years and over should continue getting mammograms every 1 to 2 years.

If you use contraception, ask your doctor about the pros and cons of birth control pills .
If you are near or in menopause, ask your doctor if you should use hormone replacement therapy to treat menopause symptoms. Studies suggest that hormone replacement, especially therapies with a combination of estrogens and progestins, can increase the risk of breast cancer. You and your doctor can make this decision based on your risk of breast cancer.
If you are at high risk for breast cancer, certain drugs that block the effects of estrogen , such as raloxifene and tamoxifen , have been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer.

Three-dimensional mammograms, to be used along with traditional digital mammograms, are also available in some screening centers.	0.95	0.9963169097900391	2026-01-27T14:41:55.128377

For some women and those assigned female at birth, age 40 marks the time to begin annual mammogram screening for breast cancer . The American Cancer Society recommends that those aged 40-44 should have the choice to start mammograms if they wish to do so. If you are 45 to 54, you should get mammograms every year. If you're 55 or older, you can switch to mammograms every 2 years or can continue yearly screening. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about when to start and how often to get a mammogram. There are different guidelines for breast cancer screening depending on your risk for breast cancer and whose guidelines you choose to follow. Weigh the benefits and risks of screening tests when deciding whether to begin getting mammograms at age 40.	0.95	0.9984070658683777	2026-01-27T14:41:57.250239

Improvements in CT technology have made images clearer and reduced radiation exposure, making screening safer and more effective. New methods like helical CT offer detailed lung images, helping doctors find smaller tumors that older methods might miss. Markers in blood and sputum. Scientists are working on better tests using your blood and sputum (mucus in the lungs) to catch lung cancer early. There are two main areas they’re focusing on: Blood tests. Researchers are studying blood samples to see if they can find tumor cells or specific molecules that indicate lung cancer. This could help diagnose the disease sooner. Sputum tests. Scientists are examining spit samples for unusual cells or molecules that might show someone needs more testing for lung cancer.

You might get one or more of them: The female hormones estrogen and progesterone help some breast cancer cells grow. These cancers are hormone-receptor positive. Some drugs fight these cancers by plugging into special receptors on the breast cancer cells. These drugs block these receptors so that the hormones can’t attach to them. Other drugs help reduce estrogen production in the body. These drugs are only beneficial for people who have hormone receptor-positive cancers. This is used in many different types of cancer . Targeted therapy is directed at specific proteins on cancer cells that help them grow and spread. By shutting down or weakening these proteins, the drugs can stop the progress of the cancer. Many different proteins can drive breast cancers. The most common target for these drugs is HER2. Whether you get a targeted drug depends on what’s helping your breast cancer cells grow. Immunotherapy. This also is used to treat many kinds of cancer. Immunotherapy helps your body’s immune system recognize cancer cells and attack them.

Poisons, which are the most common cause of acute renal failure.

Even a single tablet of ibuprofen can lead to their kidneys shutting down. Check around your house and garage for these substances and make sure your cat can’t get into them.
Trauma, especially involving a broken pelvis or burst bladder
Shock from losing a lot of blood quickly or rapid dehydration ; overheating in hot weather, a significant rise in activity, vomiting, and diarrhea can all cause a big dip in fluids.
Infection in the kidneys

Boost your intake of omega-3 fatty acids. You can get these healthy fats by taking fish oil supplements and eating fish. They may help reduce inflammation in the glomeruli and don’t cause harmful side effects. You can buy supplements over the counter, but talk to your doctor before taking them.
Keep your blood pressure in check. Having a healthy blood pressure can help slow down kidney damage. Take your medications the way your doctor prescribes. You can also improve your blood pressure through diet, especially by reducing your salt intake and avoiding excess alcohol. Losing excess weight and getting regular exercise are also helpful. You should also keep track of your blood pressure numbers by monitoring them at home.
Eat less protein. Eating too much protein can make your kidneys work too hard and speed up the worsening of your IgA nephropathy. But before you cut back, check with your doctor or nutritionist to be sure you get enough. Eating too little protein can cause malnutrition.
Eat less salt. Too much salt can increase your blood pressure and cause more protein to spill into the urine.
Avoid harmful meds. This can include over-the-counter meds such as NSAIDs, as well as certain prescription medications. Talk to your doctor before starting any new medicine.
Quit smoking. Along with slowing down blood flow to your kidneys, smoking can affect how well your blood pressure medications work.
Drink the right amount of water. Help your body work well with the right amount of fluids. But talk to your doctor about how much is too much."	0.95	0.9171735644340515	2026-01-27T14:47:43.319052

When they are used, which is rare, there are two main types of implants to control pain:
Intrathecal Drug Delivery. Also called infusion pain pumps or spinal drug delivery systems. The surgeon makes a pocket under the skin that's large enough to hold a medicine pump. The pump is usually about one inch thick and three inches wide. The surgeon also inserts a catheter, which carries pain medicine from the pump to the intrathecal space around the spinal cord. The implants deliver medicines such as morphine or a muscle relaxant directly to the spinal cord , where pain signals travel. For this reason, intrathecal drug delivery can provide significant pain control with a fraction of the dose that would be required with pills. In addition, the system can cause fewer side effects than oral medications because less medicine is required to control pain.
Spinal Cord Stimulation Implants. In spinal cord stimulation , low-level electrical signals are transmitted to the spinal cord or to specific nerves to block pain signals from reaching the brain. This method being especially used for back and limb pain. In this procedure, a device that delivers the electrical signals is surgically implanted in the body. A remote control is used by the patient to turn the current off and on or to adjust the intensity of the signals. Some devices cause what’s described as a pleasant, tingling sensation while others do not. Two kinds of spinal cord stimulation systems are available. Partial and totally implanted units.

A colonoscopy: This test uses a flexible tube with a camera on the end to look inside your colon and rectum. During the exam, the doctor can remove any suspicious polyps. They can also take samples of tissue to test in a lab for signs of cancer .
Stool tests look for tiny amounts of blood in your poop. Another type checks it for specific DNA markers that could be a sign of colorectal cancer.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy : This test uses a flexible tube with a camera to let your doctor look inside the lower part of your colon and your rectum. Doctors often do a stool test along with it to look for blood.
Imaging tests, such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ). These tests can make images of the whole colon by using X-rays and computers. One type, called a CT colonography or virtual colonoscopy, makes pictures of the entire colon and rectum to look for polyps or cancer. If the doctor sees a problem area, they’ll need to give you a regular colonoscopy to take a closer look and get a sample of tissue for testing."	0.95	0.9045076370239258	2026-01-27T14:51:22.457355

If everyone does their part – scientists and farmers, manufacturers and retailers, governments and nonprofits, and of course, consumers – we can save the planet and have enough nutritious food to go around. “Farmers are wildly more sustainable now than they were in 1980,” says Jack Bobo, JD, director of global food and water policy at the Nature Conservancy. “It’s not as if things are bad and getting worse – they’re good and getting better, just not fast enough. Historical trends won’t get us where we need to go by 2050. We need to do things differently.”	0.95	0.9192759394645691	2026-01-27T14:52:31.355552

Cryotherapy. This is a freezing treatment that’s designed to restrict your blood vessels. It should slow down or prevent leaking in the early stages of Coats’ disease.
Photocoagulation. Your physician uses lasers to heat and destroy abnormal blood cells. This can be done alone or in combination with cryotherapy. It’s most helpful early on.
Eye injections. This could include medications like steroids or a newer treatment called anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy (Anti-VEGF). This is meant to reduce leakage and lower your risk of retinal detachment.
Vitrectomy surgery. This treats more advanced stages of the disease. It’s a surgery used to reattach your retina."	0.9460773468017578	0.870384931564331	2026-01-27T14:55:45.444976

And that's post-operative therapy, so therapy after recovery from surgery that is similarly meant to reduce risk of relapse in the future.	0.95	0.7823841571807861	2026-01-27T15:01:34.554782

Smith, MD		Two big ongoing trends in breast cancer medicine today offer patients tremendous promise. One is the development of new drugs that target cancer cells directly. Some interfere with specific molecules involved with cancer cell development or tumor growth. Others slow the growth of breast cancer cells that enlarge in response to the hormone estrogen. These drugs work by blocking estrogen’s effect. Still others target the vascular system and block development of blood vessels that help feed the cancer cells.	0.9366461634635925	0.9984965324401855	2026-01-27T15:02:00.396110

In other words, most of them should have had the freedom to choose which surgery they wanted, says Matthew Lewis Pierotti, MD, a breast surgical oncology fellow at Fox Chase Cancer Center, who led the study. The study looked at surgery options in people with three subtypes of breast cancer: Hormone receptor (HR), HER2-positive, and triple-negative (TN) tumors. When the tumor is HR-positive, that means it grows from the hormones estrogen or progesterone . Doctors treat HR-positive breast cancer with drugs that target a specific hormone. HER2-positive breast cancer gets its name when your body makes too much human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein. These tumors tend to grow faster and come back. Instead of giving hormone-based treatments, doctors have to target the HER2. In recent years, newer treatments have come on the market that have substantially improved outcomes. Triple-negative (TN) tumors are harder to treat because they don’t have hormone or HER2 receptors. They’re more likely to come back and are more aggressive than HR or HER-positive breast cancers. In the study, the researchers found that people with HER2-positive breast cancer were 1.39 times more likely to have a mastectomy compared to those with HR-positive cancers. But there wasn’t much of a difference in people who got mastectomies whether they had HR-positive or TN cancers.	0.929145872592926	0.7594356536865234	2026-01-27T15:02:03.334350

A healthy diet and daily exercise won’t cure treatment-resistant depression, but they can make it more manageable. Even better, these strategies won’t cost you a lot of money. Here are some lifestyle choices that may help: Have fish for dinner. A Mediterranean-style diet, an eating pattern rich in fruits, veggies, whole grains, beans, seafood, and healthy fats like olive oil, has been shown to help reduce the risk of depression. Try meditation or yoga. Stress can worsen depression, including treatment-resistant depression. Techniques to calm your mind such as yoga, tai chi, meditation, or even journaling can help. A 2021 study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine , for example, found that regular yoga practice improves symptoms of depression. Sleep better. Insomnia doubles depression risk. Poor sleep may worsen depression because it affects your energy level and your ability to handle stress. Simple fixes like keeping a regular bedtime and wake-up time and limiting screens before bed can help. Walk every day. It’s a simple, low-cost form of exercise. In a 2022 review in JAMA Psychiatry that looked at 15 studies of over 190,000 people, those who walked briskly for 2.5 hours a week had a 25% lower risk of depression.	0.95	0.7218651175498962	2026-01-27T15:02:48.825392

In depression, it works to quickly restore the connections between nerve cells. In 2019, the FDA approved a nasal spray version of ketamine, called esketamine (Spravato), to treat people whose depression hasn't improved on two different antidepressants. Psychedelic drugs like psilocybin and MDMA (ecstasy ) work in a similar way to ketamine – by making new connections in the brain. These drugs also show promise for treatment-resistant depression. In studies, psilocybin worked quickly to relieve depression and MDMA showed promise for treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD ), Krystal says.

Side effects are similar to those of other antidepressants. Unlike other fast-acting antidepressants, it’s safe to take on your own. Since dextromethorphan/bupropion is an NMDA receptor antagonist, it works on the same brain chemicals as esketamine or ketamine. But it’s not as powerful, so you might still need those if you have suicidal thoughts or think you might hurt yourself. If you’re interested in Auvelity, talk to your doctor. Since it’s a newer drug, not all health care providers are familiar with it. If you have health insurance, your insurer might say you need to try other treatments before they’ll pay for it.

Physical therapy : A professional can show you exercises to strengthen and stretch the muscles in your shoulder, upper arm, and wrists.
Steroids : Shots into your elbow tendons can briefly ease some of the swelling and pain around your elbow joint.
Botox : Studies show that these shots can treat chronic tennis elbow.
Needle fenestration : This treatment uses a special ultrasound to repeatedly guide a needle into the injured tendon to increase blood flow and promote healing.
Ultrasonic tenotomy : Also called Tenex , this procedure uses ultrasound to guide a needle into the damaged tendon. Then the needle is vibrated with ultrasonic energy so fast, it turns injured tissue to liquid so it can be removed.
Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy : Your platelets (cells in your blood that stop bleeding) are separated from your other blood cells and then injected back into the injured tendons to encourage healing."	0.9481797218322754	0.9921995997428894	2026-01-27T15:06:09.588875

Osteoarthritis is usually treated with medications , exercise , applying heat and cold to the painful joint, use of supportive devices such as crutches or canes, and controlling one's weight . Surgery may help relieve osteoarthritis pain when other treatment options have not been effective. The type of osteoarthritis treatment prescribed will depend on several factors, including a person's age, activity level, occupation, overall health, medical history, and severity of the condition. Yet, traditional treatments for osteoarthritis do not change the progression of the disease. Because the breakdown of cartilage is a significant part of osteoarthritis, researchers have been focusing their efforts on finding agents to prevent this breakdown. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfates are two nutritional supplements currently being studied to determine their usefulness in treating osteoarthritis.	0.9492655992507935	0.9035959243774414	2026-01-27T15:06:31.909260

One new study shows women with HER2-positive early breast cancer were able to be successfully treated without chemotherapy thus avoiding its harsh side effects. HER2 positive breast cancer is not that common, and diagnosed in about 1 in 5 women with breast cancer. It means that the cancer cells have additional copies of the gene producing the HER2 protein, and this cancer type tends to be more aggressive than others. But treatment has been developed that is specifically targeted to HER2 positive breast cancer. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab target the HER2 protein, and these two drugs are generally used together with traditional chemotherapy before and after surgery. The current study, however, presented recently at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago, showed that some women can forgo chemotherapy.	0.9396248459815979	0.9980958104133606	2026-01-27T15:08:41.002750

In addition, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as Aleve and Motrin) may reduce the size of polyps and, therefore, the risk of colon cancer. This theory has not been well established, and the proper dosage is unclear. Also, NSAIDs may raise your odds of serious complications, such as stomach bleeding, heart attacks, and strokes. If you’re at high risk of colon cancer, don’t start taking aspirin or other NSAIDs until you discuss it with your doctor.	0.9481910467147827	0.5891945958137512	2026-01-27T15:09:10.063888

Smith, MD		Two big ongoing trends in breast cancer medicine today offer patients tremendous promise. One is the development of new drugs that target cancer cells directly. Some interfere with specific molecules involved with cancer cell development or tumor growth. Others slow the growth of breast cancer cells that enlarge in response to the hormone estrogen. These drugs work by blocking estrogen’s effect. Still others target the vascular system and block development of blood vessels that help feed the cancer cells.	0.9456400871276855	0.9978152513504028	2026-01-27T15:09:36.433529

That means medicines that fight cancer throughout your entire body, rather than surgery or radiation that target cancer in a specific area. (Though in some cases, doctors also use radiation and surgery in metastatic breast cancer.) Here’s an overview of the systemic treatments for breast cancer. You might get one or more of them: The female hormones estrogen and progesterone help some breast cancer cells grow. These cancers are hormone-receptor positive. Some drugs fight these cancers by plugging into special receptors on the breast cancer cells. These drugs block these receptors so that the hormones can’t attach to them. Other drugs help reduce estrogen production in the body. These drugs are only beneficial for people who have hormone receptor-positive cancers. This is used in many different types of cancer . Targeted therapy is directed at specific proteins on cancer cells that help them grow and spread. By shutting down or weakening these proteins, the drugs can stop the progress of the cancer. Many different proteins can drive breast cancers. The most common target for these drugs is HER2. Whether you get a targeted drug depends on what’s helping your breast cancer cells grow. Immunotherapy. This also is used to treat many kinds of cancer. Immunotherapy helps your body’s immune system recognize cancer cells and attack them. The type used in breast cancer blocks a protein on T cells in your immune system that keeps them from attacking cancer cells. You may get this drug along with chemotherapy if you have triple-negative breast cancer. That means the cancer doesn’t have the receptors for either of the hormones (progesterone and estrogen) that play a role in breast cancer or HER2 proteins, which targeted breast cancer drugs fight. Chemotherapy. This includes many drugs that can reach and kill cancer cells throughout your entire body.

There are three main types:
Retirement housing . This kind of setting is better for someone with early Alzheimer's who can still care for themselves and live alone safely, but would have a hard time managing an entire house. Generally, these places don’t have 24-hour supervision, and the staff may know very little about dementia .
Basic assisted living . This is the step between living independently and living in a nursing home . Assisted-living facilities offer housing and meals, as well as health care services and any other support your loved one needs, like help with chores or bathing.
Nursing homes . When someone needs round-the-clock care and long-term medical treatment, this may be the best choice. A good nursing home will be able to address a lot of needs, such as daily care planning, social activities, spirituality, nutrition, and medical care. Many facilities have special units designed for people with dementia.
Continuum care retirement communities . These offer the different levels of residential care -- independent living, assisted living, and nursing home services -- in one location. Residents can move within the facility to get different services when their needs change."	0.9432107210159302	0.8639523983001709	2026-01-27T15:09:55.601569

Wrinkles	https://www.webmd.com/melanoma-skin-cancer/skin-sun-damage-treatment	WebMD Editorial Contributors	Stephanie S. Gardner, MD	2024-02-21	"UV rays can break down collagen and elastin, two proteins that keep skin firm and smooth. Try these treatments to iron out those wrinkles:
Beta-carotene: Research shows that this antioxidant makes skin more supple and flexible and reduces sun-related wrinkles. You can find it in fruits and vegetables, such as carrots, spinach, and cantaloupe, or in a supplement.
Retinoids: These compounds boost the amount of collagen in your skin. Your dermatologist can prescribe a cream or a serum, such as tretinoin (Renova, Retin-A). You can find a less potent form, retinol, in over-the-counter products. They do everything from smoothing fine lines and fading dark spots to making pores look smaller. Use the product at night since sunlight makes retinoids inactive. They can irritate your skin, so it’s best to ease them into your skin care routine. Apply every other night to start, and slowly work up to nightly use. During the day, use a cream with antioxidants like vitamin C, coffeeberry extract, or green tea. They defend against the sun’s damage to collagen and elastin, the proteins that keep skin firm and supple, and improve existing signs of aging.
Chemical peels : This treatment removes damaged cells from the upper layers of your skin. Options can range from alpha-hydroxy or salicylic acid cream you apply yourself to a medium-depth peel, which you get from a dermatologist.
Microdermabrasion : This technique uses tiny grains, crystals, or diamond tips to remove the outer layer of skin. It also prompts the growth of collagen.
Laser therapy: Short pulses of concentrated light remove specific layers or areas of the skin to reveal fresh, new skin beneath. There are a few different types of laser therapy, including CO2 and erbium laser resurfacing.
Microneedling : This procedure involves prickling the skin with tiny sterilized needles. The small wounds cause your body to make more collagen and elastin, which heal your skin and help you look younger."	0.9391061663627625	0.9843662977218628	2026-01-27T15:11:58.303391

The shingles vaccine Zostavax was licensed in the U.S. in 2006. Data from the Shingles Prevention Trial, which enrolled 38,000 adults aged 60 and over, showed that men and women who got the shingles vaccine were half as likely to get the ailment after an average follow-up period of three years compared to those given a placebo shot. Vaccinated study participants who did develop shingles also had reduced pain compared to participants given a placebo shot. The vaccine was most effective in people ages 60-69 with increased decline in effectiveness associated with older age.	0.9440645575523376	0.9753590822219849	2026-01-27T15:12:09.537232

Targeted therapy : These treatments take aim at specific parts of cancer cells. For example, some targeted therapies go after melanoma cells that have changes in certain genes. These include binimetinib ( Mektovi ), cobimetinib ( Cotellic ), dabrafenib ( Tafinlar ), encorafenib ( Braftovi ), imatinib (Gleevec), nilotinib (Tasigna), trametinib ( Mekinist ), and vemurafenib ( Zelboraf ).
Vaccines: The T-VEC ( Imlygic ) and Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccines are injected directly into melanoma tumors. They help your immune system work to kill cancer cells. Researchers are testing other vaccines that may keep the cancer from coming back.
Radiation therapy : This uses beams of energy to destroy cancer cells. It’s usually done on the area where lymph nodes were removed.
Chemotherapy : This is a combination of powerful drugs used to kill cancer cells. It’s recommended more often with stage III. Chemo is usually only an option for stage IV if other treatments haven’t worked.

Research has shown that the Mediterranean diet may lower the risk of developing Alzheimer's, and may even help prolong life in people with Alzheimer's. The Mediterranean diet has very little red meat. The diet focuses on fruits, vegetables, and nuts, with moderate amounts of dairy, fish, and poultry. Olive oil is an important source of healthy fats . Moderate amounts of alcohol, particularly wine, may also lower the risk of Alzheimer's. However, doctors don't recommend that people start drinking alcohol to prevent disease.	0.95	0.9999507665634155	2026-01-27T15:12:59.860984

They offer another option for people who have moderate to severe depression and don’t respond to traditional treatments. Here’s a closer look at recent advances: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) This technique uses magnets to stimulate areas of the brain that affect your mood. The magnetic field used in rTMS is about as strong as an MRI scan. These pulses boost connections between nerve cells to ease depression symptoms, like helplessness and lack of pleasure (anhedonia).	0.95	0.9995825886726379	2026-01-27T15:15:50.697759

In one trial, after a BCG vaccination, MRI images of multiple sclerosis patients showed fewer enhancing lesions , a marker of disease activity. In a trial on type 1 diabetes , BCG vaccination helped restore blood sugars to near normal, even in patients who had the disease for years. For Crohn’s disease, some research suggests that BCG vaccination could sustain remission , and a study published in November 2024 showed that tetanus vaccination is linked to a slower progression of Parkinson’s disease.	0.95	0.9993632435798645	2026-01-27T15:16:55.443115

They include:
Drugs that increase insulin production by the pancreas, including chlorpropamide (Diabinese), glimepiride, (Amaryl), glipizide (Glucotrol), glyburide ( DiaBeta , Glynase), nateglinide (Starlix), and repaglinide (Prandin)
Drugs that decrease sugar absorption by the intestines, such as acarbose (Precose) and miglitol (Glyset)
Drugs that improve how the body uses insulin, such as pioglitazone (Actos) and rosiglitazone (Avandia)
Drugs that decrease sugar production by the liver and improve insulin resistance, like metformin (Glucophage). Metformin causes weight loss and this is one of the ways it helps bring blood sugars back to normal.
Drugs that increase insulin production by the pancreas or its blood levels and/or reduce sugar production from the liver, including alogliptin ( Nesina ), dulaglutide (Trulicity), exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon), linagliptin (Tradjenta), liraglutide (Victoza), lixisenatide ( Adlyxin ), saxagliptin ( Onglyza ), semaglutide (Ozempic), sitagliptin ( Januvia ), and tirzepatide ( Mounjaro ).
Drugs that block the reabsorption of glucose by the kidney and increase glucose excretions in urine, called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. They also trigger weight loss which helps bring blood sugars back to normal. They are canaglifozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), empagliflozin (Jardiance), and ertugliflozin ( Steglatro ) . These drugs can also help reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure and cardiovascular death in patients with heart failure.
Pramlinitide (Symlin) is an injectable synthetic hormone. It helps lower blood sugar after meals in people with diabetes who use insulin."	0.9419363141059875	0.8259327411651611	2026-01-27T15:16:58.972876

Research has shown that the Mediterranean diet may lower the risk of developing Alzheimer's, and may even help prolong life in people with Alzheimer's. The Mediterranean diet has very little red meat. The diet focuses on fruits, vegetables, and nuts, with moderate amounts of dairy, fish, and poultry. Olive oil is an important source of healthy fats . Moderate amounts of alcohol, particularly wine, may also lower the risk of Alzheimer's.

Omega-3 fatty acid. Omega-3 fish oil supplements have piqued great interest. Studies suggest that a higher intake of omega-3 fatty acid from foods such as cold-water fish, plant and nut oils, and English walnuts are strongly linked to a lower risk of Alzheimer's. However, thorough studies comparing omega-3s to placebo are needed to prove this memory benefit from supplements.
Huperzine A. Also known as Chinese club moss, this natural medicine works in a similar way as Alzheimer's drugs. But more evidence is needed to confirm its safety and effectiveness.
Acetyl-L-carnitine. Some studies suggest that this amino acid might help Alzheimer's patients with memory problems. It may provide a greater benefit to people with early onset and a fast rate of the disease.
Vitamin E . Although vitamin E apparently doesn't decrease the risk of developing Alzheimer's, it may slow its progression. Recent studies have raised concerns about an increased risk of deaths in unhealthy people who take high doses of vitamin E, so be sure to consult with your doctor before taking this supplement.
Asian (or Panax) ginseng. An herb that's sometimes used with ginkgo biloba, Asian ginseng may help with fatigue and quality of life, Fugh-Berman tells WebMD. But any benefit for memory, she says, has shown up mostly in a small group or subset of study participants."	0.9438788294792175	0.8700554370880127	2026-01-27T15:18:18.572399

Guns should be stored unloaded in locked storage like a gun safe, and families should store ammunition separately.	0.95	0.9734823107719421	2026-01-27T15:21:03.970483

As a result, each state has launched its own challenges to the legality of abortions and if they are allowed, at what stage of pregnancy. The laws continue to change quickly, so it’s hard to get an exact state-by-state count, but common restrictions include:
Complete ban on abortions
Banning abortions after a certain point in the pregnancy, including after the detection of a heartbeat (usually 6 weeks after the last period) or when the fetus can live outside the mother's womb. In many states, this threshold is 20 weeks. In some, it’s 24 weeks. Most states make exceptions if the mother’s life or health is in danger.
Requiring a licensed doctor to perform abortions
Waiting for an abortion, usually 24 hours, while you get counseling
Allowing individual health care providers to refuse to perform abortions
Allowing health care institutions to refuse to perform abortions
Allowing religious or private institutions to refuse to perform abortions
Requiring a parent to be involved in decision-making when a minor wants an abortion
Requiring one or both parents of the minor to consent to an abortion

But it adds other mental strategies that can be especially helpful when symptoms worsen, such as:
Staying flexible: This can mean changing the way you think of normal. A good sense of humor and a positive outlook can help a lot when you’re dealing with some of the serious issues that MS can throw your way.
Planning ahead: There are serious practical challenges that can arise with MS. You can help lessen the challenges and the anxiety that goes along with them if you plan for them. For example, as you start to become less mobile, you can slowly work toward making your home easier to navigate by wheelchair.
Seeking meaning: This can mean involvement in your community through outreach, hobbies, or religious organizations. Or it may be time together with friends and family.

The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) found that low-dose CT scans can lower lung cancer death rates by 15%-20% compared to regular chest X-rays. Improvements in CT technology have made images clearer and reduced radiation exposure, making screening safer and more effective. New methods like helical CT offer detailed lung images, helping doctors find smaller tumors that older methods might miss. Markers in blood and sputum. Scientists are working on better tests using your blood and sputum (mucus in the lungs) to catch lung cancer early. There are two main areas they’re focusing on: Blood tests. Researchers are studying blood samples to see if they can find tumor cells or specific molecules that indicate lung cancer. This could help diagnose the disease sooner. Sputum tests.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). In this treatment, a nasal device attached to a machine with a blower unit helps keep the airway open. CPAP is the most common treatment used for obstructive sleep apnea.
Inspire . This is a small impulse generator that is implanted beneath the clavicle and acts as a stimulator for your upper airway..
Solriamfetol ( Sunosi ). This medication can be used to improve wakefulness in people who have excessive sleepiness due to sleep apnea.
Oral appliance therapy. Devices move the tongue, lower jaw, or soft palate forward, which opens the airway.
Weight loss . If you have obesity, losing weight can decrease the risk for sleep apnea by reducing fat deposits in the neck. It also reduces many of the other risks associated with sleep apnea, such as heart disease.

Mirza, MD, as told to Rachel Reiff Ellis To understand how far we’ve come with geographic atrophy (GA), it’s important to start with the basics of the disease. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision impairment in older adults. There are two types: wet AMD, which is more aggressive, and dry AMD, which in its late stages can lead to GA. The treatment for wet AMD has been revolutionized during my career. When I was a resident, there was no wet AMD treatment that could improve your vision, only a thermal laser which burned areas of abnormal blood vessels in your eye. But then we developed photodynamic therapy to address abnormal blood vessels. Not long after, anti-VEGF treatments. Suddenly, I wasn’t seeing people with large areas of scarring anymore. The injections changed that. These developments with wet AMD are why I'm excited about the development of a new approach to dry AMD. Because we've seen how rapidly, and with such promise, innovation can come to those we treat.	0.9370435476303101	0.7028387188911438	2026-01-27T15:27:53.387440

Wrinkles	https://www.webmd.com/melanoma-skin-cancer/skin-sun-damage-treatment	WebMD Editorial Contributors	Stephanie S. Gardner, MD	2024-02-21	"UV rays can break down collagen and elastin, two proteins that keep skin firm and smooth. Try these treatments to iron out those wrinkles:
Beta-carotene: Research shows that this antioxidant makes skin more supple and flexible and reduces sun-related wrinkles. You can find it in fruits and vegetables, such as carrots, spinach, and cantaloupe, or in a supplement.
Retinoids: These compounds boost the amount of collagen in your skin. Your dermatologist can prescribe a cream or a serum, such as tretinoin (Renova, Retin-A). You can find a less potent form, retinol, in over-the-counter products. They do everything from smoothing fine lines and fading dark spots to making pores look smaller. Use the product at night since sunlight makes retinoids inactive. They can irritate your skin, so it’s best to ease them into your skin care routine. Apply every other night to start, and slowly work up to nightly use. During the day, use a cream with antioxidants like vitamin C, coffeeberry extract, or green tea. They defend against the sun’s damage to collagen and elastin, the proteins that keep skin firm and supple, and improve existing signs of aging.
Chemical peels : This treatment removes damaged cells from the upper layers of your skin. Options can range from alpha-hydroxy or salicylic acid cream you apply yourself to a medium-depth peel, which you get from a dermatologist.
Microdermabrasion : This technique uses tiny grains, crystals, or diamond tips to remove the outer layer of skin. It also prompts the growth of collagen.
Laser therapy: Short pulses of concentrated light remove specific layers or areas of the skin to reveal fresh, new skin beneath. There are a few different types of laser therapy, including CO2 and erbium laser resurfacing.
Microneedling : This procedure involves prickling the skin with tiny sterilized needles. The small wounds cause your body to make more collagen and elastin, which heal your skin and help you look younger."	0.9409815669059753	0.606255054473877	2026-01-27T15:28:02.572617

Drugs that decrease sugar absorption by the intestines, such as acarbose (Precose) and miglitol (Glyset)
Drugs that improve how the body uses insulin, such as pioglitazone (Actos) and rosiglitazone (Avandia)
Drugs that decrease sugar production by the liver and improve insulin resistance, like metformin (Glucophage). Metformin causes weight loss and this is one of the ways it helps bring blood sugars back to normal.
Drugs that increase insulin production by the pancreas or its blood levels and/or reduce sugar production from the liver, including alogliptin ( Nesina ), dulaglutide (Trulicity), exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon), linagliptin (Tradjenta), liraglutide (Victoza), lixisenatide ( Adlyxin ), saxagliptin ( Onglyza ), semaglutide (Ozempic), sitagliptin ( Januvia ), and tirzepatide ( Mounjaro ).
Drugs that block the reabsorption of glucose by the kidney and increase glucose excretions in urine, called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. They also trigger weight loss which helps bring blood sugars back to normal. They are canaglifozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), empagliflozin (Jardiance), and ertugliflozin ( Steglatro ) .

Wrinkles	https://www.webmd.com/melanoma-skin-cancer/skin-sun-damage-treatment	WebMD Editorial Contributors	Stephanie S. Gardner, MD	2024-02-21	"UV rays can break down collagen and elastin, two proteins that keep skin firm and smooth. Try these treatments to iron out those wrinkles:
Beta-carotene: Research shows that this antioxidant makes skin more supple and flexible and reduces sun-related wrinkles. You can find it in fruits and vegetables, such as carrots, spinach, and cantaloupe, or in a supplement.
Retinoids: These compounds boost the amount of collagen in your skin. Your dermatologist can prescribe a cream or a serum, such as tretinoin (Renova, Retin-A). You can find a less potent form, retinol, in over-the-counter products. They do everything from smoothing fine lines and fading dark spots to making pores look smaller. Use the product at night since sunlight makes retinoids inactive. They can irritate your skin, so it’s best to ease them into your skin care routine. Apply every other night to start, and slowly work up to nightly use. During the day, use a cream with antioxidants like vitamin C, coffeeberry extract, or green tea. They defend against the sun’s damage to collagen and elastin, the proteins that keep skin firm and supple, and improve existing signs of aging.
Chemical peels : This treatment removes damaged cells from the upper layers of your skin. Options can range from alpha-hydroxy or salicylic acid cream you apply yourself to a medium-depth peel, which you get from a dermatologist.
Microdermabrasion : This technique uses tiny grains, crystals, or diamond tips to remove the outer layer of skin. It also prompts the growth of collagen.
Laser therapy: Short pulses of concentrated light remove specific layers or areas of the skin to reveal fresh, new skin beneath. There are a few different types of laser therapy, including CO2 and erbium laser resurfacing.
Microneedling : This procedure involves prickling the skin with tiny sterilized needles. The small wounds cause your body to make more collagen and elastin, which heal your skin and help you look younger."	0.9456562995910645	0.9906873106956482	2026-01-27T15:29:54.610004

Excimer laser treatment (like LASIK) uses a laser beam to remove microscopic amounts of tissue from the cornea. This effectively flattens or steepens the cornea as needed so that light rays focus correctly on the retina. LASIK is safe and effective for most patients with nearsightedness, but only up to a certain level. Some patients with thin corneas, extreme nearsightedness, or significant dry eye may be better served with a variant of LASIK called PRK or they may not be good laser candidates at all. There are advanced options for these patients, including surgical correction with implantable contact lenses.	0.9462505578994751	0.3808044195175171	2026-01-27T15:36:17.341867

While studies have found that some people who regularly take aspirin have a lower risk of certain cancers, like colorectal cancer , the findings are nuanced. Another analysis from Murray and colleagues’ long-term trial showed that older people who took aspirin to prevent a first-time heart attack or stroke had an increased risk of developing cancer, and in particular, being diagnosed at stage 3 or later. The “findings suggest that in older persons, aspirin may accelerate the progression of cancer and, thus, suggest caution with its use in this age group,” said Murray.	0.95	0.9955645799636841	2026-01-27T15:37:04.689755

For example, there has been a boom in cardiac amyloidosis research. This disease causes the heart to become very stiff and thick. New drugs such as vutrisiran and eplontersen are being tested in these patients. The researchers hope the drugs may decrease the production of the abnormal protein that causes the stiffness and prevent disease progression. Gene therapy (NTLA-2001, a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based therapy) is also being evaluated for heart failure treatment. And there are clinical trials for devices like mechanical pumps, such as the ARIES HM3 trial.
