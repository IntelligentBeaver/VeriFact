Shed weight. Losing just 7% percent of your body weight has been shown to lower the risk for diabetes by nearly 60%.
Increase your physical activity. In addition to helping you lose weight, exercise can lower blood sugar levels and increase your sensitivity to insulin, which keeps your blood sugar levels in a normal range.
Eat more vegetables and fruits. Eating a variety of fruits, non-starchy vegetables (such as leafy greens), legumes, and whole grains can help lower your risk for diabetes. These are good sources of carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, and fiber. They can also keep diabetes complications such as heart disease and high blood pressure at bay.

This can happen fairly quickly after you start taking the medication, sometimes even at low doses. Your doctor may give you other treatments to minimize bone loss while you’re on steroids.
Death of bone tissue due to poor blood supply. This usually only happens with long-term steroid use and high doses. The exact cause is unknown.
Cataracts or glaucoma. You may need to have surgery to remove cataracts. Steroids can also worsen glaucoma if you already have it.
Muscle weakness. This is common, but it's more likely at higher doses. It can result from low potassium and calcium levels and reduced muscle proteins caused by steroid activity in the body. It’s reversible and doesn’t usually hurt.
Narrowing of blood vessels due to cholesterol buildup.
Thinning of skin
Weight gain
Pregnancy complications like preeclampsia . Check in regularly with your doctor if you’re pregnant and taking steroids."	0.95	0.9995880722999573	2026-01-26T19:37:28.764984

Scientists are working on better tests using your blood and sputum (mucus in the lungs) to catch lung cancer early. There are two main areas they’re focusing on: Blood tests. Researchers are studying blood samples to see if they can find tumor cells or specific molecules that indicate lung cancer. This could help diagnose the disease sooner. Sputum tests. Scientists are examining spit samples for unusual cells or molecules that might show someone needs more testing for lung cancer. These advancements could lead to easier and earlier detection, making treatment for NSCLC more effective.	0.9440032243728638	0.731535792350769	2026-01-26T19:50:47.968179

Both vitamin C and zinc are essential for production of infection-fighting neutrophils ; without adequate levels, you're an easy mark for all types of infections. Some research shows zinc may shorten the duration of a cold, especially in adults if taken within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Avoid zinc nasal spray as it may lead to permanent loss of smell.	0.9479371309280396	0.8626745939254761	2026-01-26T19:54:43.564441

Ipilimumab ( Yervoy ): There are two uses for this drug. It can be given to individuals who have had surgery to remove melanoma in order to prevent the melanoma from coming back. It can also be used for late-stage melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Ipilimumab is often used in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor.
Nivolumab ( Opdivo ), nivolumab- relatlimab-rmbw ( Opdualag ), and pembrolizumab ( Keytruda ) work by inhibiting the PD-1 protein on cells, which enables the body’s immune system to attack melanoma tumors. Combination therapy with ipilimumab and either nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab-relatlimab-rmbw has been shown to increase overall survival compared to treating with ipilimumab alone.

Generally, the higher the dosage, the more a statin will lower your LDL cholesterol levels. But some statins can bring your LDL to a certain level at a lower dose. Statin therapy is classified as low, moderate, or high intensity, depending on how much a certain drug can lower LDL at a given dosage. Your doctor will prescribe a statin based on your unique risk of cardiovascular disease. If your LDL cholesterol levels are high, but your heart is otherwise in good health, you may take a low- or moderate-intensity statin.

Generally, the higher the dosage, the more a statin will lower your LDL cholesterol levels. But some statins can bring your LDL to a certain level at a lower dose. Statin therapy is classified as low, moderate, or high intensity, depending on how much a certain drug can lower LDL at a given dosage. Your doctor will prescribe a statin based on your unique risk of cardiovascular disease. If your LDL cholesterol levels are high, but your heart is otherwise in good health, you may take a low- or moderate-intensity statin. If you have other risk factors for cardiovascular disease as well, you'll likely get high-intensity therapy.	0.9472364783287048	0.9555168747901917	2026-01-26T21:30:58.191473

Certain strains of HPV are linked to cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, and rectum. Other strains cause genital warts. Genital warts are usually not a major health risk, and there are several ways to treat them. Your doctor may suggest a topical medication or a procedure to remove genital warts. Getting treatment right away can reduce the symptoms of genital warts, which can include itching and discomfort. Once you have HPV, the infection itself can't be treated. But a vaccine can prevent HPV in those who haven't been infected yet. The CDC recommends vaccination for people through age 26. Children's vaccines are generally scheduled at age 11 or 12, but the vaccine is safe for those as young as 9.	0.95	0.8950804471969604	2026-01-26T21:59:15.998318

It’s important to control not only sugars, but also blood pressure and cholesterol to stop eye diseases from getting worse. Fortunately, the vision loss isn't significant in most.
Kidney damage. The risk of kidney disease rises over time, meaning the longer you have diabetes, the greater your risk. This complication carries a significant risk of serious illness -- such as kidney failure and heart disease.
Poor blood circulation and nerve damage. Damage to nerves and hardening of the arteries lead to less sensation and poor blood circulation in the feet.

Eat more vegetables and fruits. Eating a variety of fruits, non-starchy vegetables (such as leafy greens), legumes, and whole grains can help lower your risk for diabetes.

Incorporating the following tips into your everyday life may help you reduce your risk of heart disease during and after menopause:
Avoid or quit smoking . Smokers have twice (or higher) the risk of heart attack than nonsmokers. In addition to eliminating cigarettes, stay away from secondhand smoke , as it also increases the risk of heart disease.
Maintain a healthy body weight . The more you are over your ideal weight , the harder your heart has to work to give your body nutrients . Research has shown that being overweight contributes to the onset of heart disease.
Exercise throughout the week. The heart is like any other muscle -- it needs to be worked to keep it strong and healthy. Being active or exercising regularly (ideally, at least 150 minutes total each week) helps improve how well the heart pumps blood through your body. Activity and exercise also help reduce many other risk factors. It helps lower high blood pressure and cholesterol, reduces stress , helps keep weight off, and improves blood sugar levels . Check with your doctor if you have been inactive before increasing your activity level.
Eat well. Follow a diet low in saturated fat ; low in trans fat (partially hydrogenated fats); and high in fiber, whole grains , legumes (such as beans and peas), fruits, vegetables, fish , folate-rich foods, and soy.
Treat and control medical conditions. Diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure make you more likely to have heart disease."	0.948489785194397	0.3417706787586212	2026-01-26T21:59:48.142862

That’s because increasing amounts of fat boost your level of chemicals called free fatty acids. And as these accumulate, your risk of insulin resistance rises as well. Free fatty acids and insulin resistance also raise your LDL (or “bad”) cholesterol and lower your HDL (or “good”) cholesterol, as well as boost your blood pressure and your triglycerides. Fat cells also contribute to inflammation, which can lead to plaque buildup in your arteries and add to your risk of insulin resistance, high blood pressure, heart disease, and blood vessel disease.	0.95	0.9878952503204346	2026-01-26T21:59:54.257917

Gardner, MD	2025-08-06	"Nothing can completely undo sun damage , although the skin can somewhat repair itself, especially with ongoing sun protection. So, it's never too late to begin protecting yourself from the sun. Your skin does change with age -- for example, you sweat less and your skin can take longer to heal, but you can delay these changes by staying out of the sun. Follow these tips to help prevent skin cancer:
Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or greater (for UVB protection), zinc oxide (for UVA or UVB protection), and iron oxide (for visible and blue light) 20 minutes before sun exposure and every 2 hours thereafter, more if you are sweating or swimming. Check the label for directions.
Select clothing, cosmetic products, and contact lenses that offer UV protection.
Wear sunglasses with total UV protection and a wide-brimmed hat to shade your face and neck.
Avoid direct sun exposure as much as possible during peak UV radiation hours (between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.). The UVA rays, which cause premature skin aging and initiate skin cancers, are out all day long.
Perform skin self-exams regularly (at least monthly) to become familiar with existing growths and to notice any changes or new growths.
Eighty percent of a person's lifetime sun exposure is acquired before age 18. As a parent, be a good role model and foster skin cancer prevention habits in your child."	0.95	0.30840784311294556	2026-01-26T22:00:17.939649

Protects against sunburn : Sunburn can occur on any skin tone when skin is exposed to excessive UV radiation. Sunscreen helps to prevent sunburn by blocking or absorbing harmful UV rays.
Prevents premature aging : UV radiation is one of the most powerful accelerators of aging, leading to wrinkles, fine lines, collagen loss, and sagging skin. By wearing sunscreen daily, you can help prevent premature aging and maintain youthful-looking skin.
Reduces hyperpigmentation : Sun exposure can cause discoloration of the skin and darkening of existing hyperpigmentation. Sunscreen helps to prevent further pigmentation issues, promoting a more even complexion.
Lowers skin cancer risk : Although individuals with SOC have a lower risk of skin cancers overall compared to those with lighter skin tones, skin cancers can and do occur in SOC, so it's still essential to protect the skin from UV damage to minimize the risk further."	0.95	0.44867464900016785	2026-01-26T22:00:21.963507

Emanuel Finet, MD, as told to Marijke Vroomen Durning, RN As a cardiologist who works mainly with heart failure patients, I’ve seen a significant increase in treatment options since I first began practicing. Most importantly, there are new drugs that help these patients live longer, like the combination sacubitril-valsartan pill. Among other things, this drug helps preserve or recover the heart’s “ejection fraction.” As heart failure progresses, the ejection fraction (a measurement that shows how much blood is pumped out of the heart’s left ventricle) usually drops. The ventricle is one of the two lower heart chambers. Medications such as sacubitril-valsartan can help keep the heart from failing further. Other new agents that help heart failure patients are called sodium-glucose transporter inhibitors 2 (SGLT2 inhibitors). These include empagliflozin or dapagliflozin. They help not only patients with weaker hearts, but also those with stiffer hearts. The drugs help lower elevated blood sugar too, which is especially helpful in heart failure patients with diabetes. There is no one-size-fits-all regarding heart failure therapies, though. When we see our patients, we must talk about the various treatment options and personalize their care.	0.95	0.9839163422584534	2026-01-26T22:00:42.225539

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). In this treatment, a nasal device attached to a machine with a blower unit helps keep the airway open. CPAP is the most common treatment used for obstructive sleep apnea.
Inspire . This is a small impulse generator that is implanted beneath the clavicle and acts as a stimulator for your upper airway..
Solriamfetol ( Sunosi ). This medication can be used to improve wakefulness in people who have excessive sleepiness due to sleep apnea.
Oral appliance therapy. Devices move the tongue, lower jaw, or soft palate forward, which opens the airway.

If your hepatitis C isn’t treated, you can pass it to others through your blood. It can also cause you to have other serious health problems including liver scarring (cirrhosis) and liver failure. But even with advances in treatment, many people put it off or decide not to get it at all. The reasons are complex. Here’s a closer look at some of them: You’re symptom-free. About half of those with the virus that causes hepatitis C live with it for decades without any symptoms. You might not have symptoms until the virus seriously damages your liver, causing liver disease. Cost. Even though their price has fallen, direct-acting antivirals can still come with a high cost. And Medicaid may not cover the expense of hepatitis C treatment. Treatment restrictions. Some states limit access to DAAs by requiring you to meet specific criteria. For example, you must have liver damage (fibrosis), be sober from alcohol and drugs, and get a prescription from a liver disease or infectious disease specialist. Certain states have eased restrictions so more people can get hepatitis C treatment.	0.95	0.9958800077438354	2026-01-26T22:01:21.913493

Lung health: Some research suggests that periodontal health may help promote lung health for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). Periodontal disease can also increase the risk of respiratory infections such as pneumonia . This may occur from inhaling bacteria into the respiratory tract.
Nutritional health: If you lose teeth from gum disease, it may become harder to eat healthy foods such as crisp fruits and vegetables . Chewing problems can lead to poor nutrition, which, in turn, can cause other problems, including fatigue and dizziness.

Most experts recommend a dental check-up every 6 months -- more often if you have problems like gum disease. During a routine exam, your dentist or dental hygienist removes plaque build-up that you can’t brush or floss away and look for signs of decay. A regular dental exam also spots:
Early signs of oral cancer. Nine out of 10 cases of oral cancer can be treated if found early enough. Undetected, oral cancer can spread to other parts of the body and become harder to treat.
Wear and tear from tooth grinding. Called bruxism , teeth grinding may be caused by stress or anxiety. Over time, it can wear down the biting surfaces of teeth, making them more susceptible to decay. If your teeth show signs of bruxism, your dentist may recommend a mouth guard worn at night to prevent grinding.
Signs of gum disease. Gum disease, also called gingivitis or periodontitis, is the leading cause of tooth loss in older people. “Unfortunately, by the time most people notice any of the warning signs of periodontitis, it’s too late to reverse the damage,” says Sam Low, DDS, professor of periodontology at the University of Florida and president of the American Academy of Periodontology. Periodically, your dental professional should examine your gums for signs of trouble.
Interactions with medications. Older patients, especially those on multiple medications, are at risk of dry mouth, or xerostomia . Reduced saliva flow increases the risk of decay and gum problems. As many as 800 different drugs cause dry mouth as a side effect, says Iacopino, dean of the University of Manitoba Faculty of Dentistry. “Always tell your dental professional about any medications you take,” he says. A change in prescriptions may help alleviate the problem. Saliva-like oral mouthwashes are also available."	0.9482971429824829	0.463884562253952	2026-01-26T22:01:58.211994

Smoking. When you smoke, vape, or chew tobacco, your blood pressure temporarily increases. Over time, regular smoking can damage and harden your blood vessels.
Being overweight or obese. Extra weight impacts your heart and blood vessels. For example, it can cause high cholesterol .
Lack of physical activity. People who don’t exercise tend to have higher heart rates.
Eating too much salt. Salt causes your body to hold onto water. This increases the amount of blood being pushed through your arteries.
Not eating enough potassium. Potassium helps balance the amount of salt and water in your body. Dehydration also can affect your potassium levels.
Drinking too much alcohol. Having more than one to two drinks per day can increase your blood pressure, especially if you are a man.
Stress. Feeling nervous or stressed can temporarily raise your blood pressure. When this happens at the doctor’s office, it is called white coat syndrome.
Age. As you get older, you are more likely to get high blood pressure. High blood pressure usually affects adults, but it is becoming more common among kids.
Sex. Among people under age 64, high blood pressure is more likely to affect men than women. But after age 65, women are at a higher risk.
Family history. High blood pressure tends to run in families.
Race. In the U.S., high blood pressure is more common among Black people than white people. It also usually starts at an earlier age. Blood pressure control, among those for whom blood pressure medication is recommended, is lower among Asian people and Black people compared to non-Hispanic white people.
Pregnancy. Blood pressure can rise during pregnancy.
Certain health conditions. People with chronic kidney disease, adrenal and thyroid disorders, and sleep apnea are at risk for secondary hypertension.
Certain medications. Birth control pills , anti-inflammatory drugs, and other medicines can cause your blood pressure to go up."	0.95	0.6298855543136597	2026-01-26T22:02:08.612415

But too much sodium, usually from eating too much table salt, can harm your heart. When you eat too much salt, the level of sodium in your blood rises. This pulls water into the blood vessels, which increases the amount of blood flowing through them as well as your blood pressure. That makes the heart work harder to pump blood throughout the body. If the amount of sodium in the blood isn't kept under control, over time, it can stretch or damage vessel walls and speed up plaque buildup, which can affect blood flow. According to the American Heart Association, people in the U.S. generally eat about 3,400 milligrams of sodium per day. That's 50% more than the recommended amount. A study published by the organization shows that cutting sodium to 1,500 milligrams per day could lower blood pressure by 25.6%. Fortunately, many Latin dishes already use healthy ingredients that allow you to add flavor without relying too much on table salt. ""Use traditional herbs and spices like garlic , oregano , achiote, and cilantro to cut salt,"" suggests Mendoza Castro."	0.95	0.9915803074836731	2026-01-26T22:02:09.674216

Retinopathy. People with type 2 diabetes may already have eye problems related to the disease. And over time, people who don’t have eye problems related to diabetes may get some form of eye problem. It’s important to control not only sugars, but also blood pressure and cholesterol to stop eye diseases from getting worse. Fortunately, the vision loss isn't significant in most.
Kidney damage. The risk of kidney disease rises over time, meaning the longer you have diabetes, the greater your risk. This complication carries a significant risk of serious illness -- such as kidney failure and heart disease.
Poor blood circulation and nerve damage. Damage to nerves and hardening of the arteries lead to less sensation and poor blood circulation in the feet. This can bring on more infections and a higher risk of ulcers that heal poorly. In turn, this can significantly raise the risk of amputation.

Eye disease is a common condition that happens with diabetes. Blood sugar spikes can damage blood vessels throughout the body, including those in your eyes. Diabetic retinopathy is one type of eye disease caused by diabetes. It happens when your blood sugar is too high and damages your retina , the tissue that lines the inside of the eye. The retina’s job is to take in light and transfer signals to your brain via a nerve at the rear of your eye called the optic nerve. Small blood vessels connected to your retina leak fluid or bleed when sugar damages them. Your eyes do grow new blood vessels, but they’re weaker and have trouble keeping in blood and fluids.	0.95	0.7869346141815186	2026-01-26T22:02:35.440986

One of the biggest risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea is excess weight and obesity which is a complex condition in which your body holds on to excess weight. A decrease in breathing reduces oxygen to tissues and can lead to heart disease. Afib and other heart conditions are seen in people with sleep apnea.	0.95	0.9514819383621216	2026-01-26T22:02:40.304907

Certain strains of HPV are linked to cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, and rectum. Other strains cause genital warts. Genital warts are usually not a major health risk, and there are several ways to treat them. Your doctor may suggest a topical medication or a procedure to remove genital warts. Getting treatment right away can reduce the symptoms of genital warts, which can include itching and discomfort. Once you have HPV, the infection itself can't be treated. But a vaccine can prevent HPV in those who haven't been infected yet. The CDC recommends vaccination for people through age 26. Children's vaccines are generally scheduled at age 11 or 12, but the vaccine is safe for those as young as 9.	0.95	0.8353581428527832	2026-01-26T22:04:02.690145

Fortunately, great strides have been made in the HIV prevention and care. Improved awareness of the disease, access to testing, and availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medicine can help prevent you from getting HIV. And antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress the virus low enough that it can prevent you from spreading it to others if you have it. Yet research shows that certain groups, especially Black and Hispanic people, are less likely to use these preventative measures and have higher rates of infection than other groups. And they’re also more likely to have worse outcomes. Here’s a look at the different factors that contribute to racial, gender, and sexual disparities in HIV infections and prevention and care.	0.95	0.9983168840408325	2026-01-26T22:04:22.577772

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) also can keep the virus at an undetectable level so that you can avoid passing the virus on to anyone else.	0.95	0.9926481246948242	2026-01-26T22:04:23.308339

Osteoporosis. Steroids act directly on the cells that make new bone and break down old bone. This causes less bone to be made and more bone to be broken down, which can lead to fractures. This can happen fairly quickly after you start taking the medication, sometimes even at low doses. Your doctor may give you other treatments to minimize bone loss while you’re on steroids.
Death of bone tissue due to poor blood supply. This usually only happens with long-term steroid use and high doses. The exact cause is unknown.
Cataracts or glaucoma. You may need to have surgery to remove cataracts. Steroids can also worsen glaucoma if you already have it.
Muscle weakness. This is common, but it's more likely at higher doses. It can result from low potassium and calcium levels and reduced muscle proteins caused by steroid activity in the body. It’s reversible and doesn’t usually hurt.
Narrowing of blood vessels due to cholesterol buildup.
Thinning of skin
Weight gain

Johnson, MD	2024-11-09	"Important risk factors for osteoporosis include:
Age. After maximum bone density and strength is reached (generally around age 30), bone mass begins to naturally decline with age.
Gender. Women over the age of 50 have the greatest risk of developing osteoporosis. In fact, women are four times more likely than men to develop osteoporosis. Women's lighter, thinner bones and longer life spans account for some of the reasons why they are at a higher risk for osteoporosis.
Ethnicity. Research has shown that Caucasian and Asian women are more likely to develop osteoporosis. Additionally, hip fractures are twice as likely to occur in Caucasian women as in African-American women. However, women of color who fracture their hips have a higher mortality.
Bone structure and body weight . Petite and thin women have a greater risk of developing osteoporosis in part because they have less bone to lose than women with more body weight and larger frames. Similarly, small-boned, thin men are at greater risk than men with larger frames and more body weight.
Family history. Heredity is one of the most important risk factors for osteoporosis. If your parents or grandparents have had any signs of osteoporosis , such as a fractured hip after a minor fall, you may be at greater risk of developing the disease.
Prior history of fracture/bone breakage.
Certain medications . The use of some medications, such as the long term use of steroids (like prednisone ) can also increase your risk of developing osteoporosis.
Some medical conditions : Some diseases including cancer and stroke may increase your risk for osteoporosis."	0.9365296363830566	0.9481258392333984	2026-01-26T22:04:58.377328

In fact, asthma symptoms and hospital admissions are greatly increased during periods of heavy air pollution. Ozone is the major destructive ingredient in smog. It causes coughing , shortness of breath, and even chest pain -- and can boost the susceptibility to infection. Sulfur dioxide, another component of smog, also irritates the airways and constricts the air passages, resulting in asthma attacks .	0.95	0.9997578263282776	2026-01-26T22:05:02.233828

Obesity . Maintaining an ideal weight or losing excess weight may help prevent osteoarthritis of the knees , hips, and back. Weight loss can also decrease the progression of OA.
Injury. People with joint injuries due to sports, work-related activity, or accidents may be at increased risk of developing OA. For example, athletes with knee-related injuries may be at higher risk of developing osteoarthritis of the knee. In addition, people who have had a severe back injury may be predisposed to develop osteoarthritis of the spine . People who have had a broken bone near a joint are prone to develop osteoarthritis in that joint.
Heredity. Some people have an inherited defect in one of the genes responsible for making cartilage. This can cause defective cartilage, which leads to more rapid deterioration of joints. People born with joint abnormalities are more likely to develop osteoarthritis, and those born with an abnormality of the spine (such as scoliosis , a curvature of the spine ) are more likely to develop osteoarthritis of the spine.
Joint Overuse. Overuse of certain joints increases the risk of developing OA. For example, people in jobs requiring repeated bending of the knee are at increased risk for developing OA of the knee.
Age. Although age is a risk factor, research has shown that OA is not an inevitable part of aging."	0.95	0.9991687536239624	2026-01-26T22:05:48.714038

Unusual joints at birth (congenital abnormalities). These are more likely to wear down, especially in the hip.
Body mechanics. Things that change the way your body works, such as an unusual way of walking or joints that have a wider range of motion than usual (called hypermobility), can put more stress on them.
Your job or hobby. Using a joint to make the same motion over and over again -- like squatting or lifting -- may be linked to osteoarthritis.
Gout . Crystal deposits in the cartilage can cause damage and osteoarthritis. Uric acid crystals cause arthritis in gout, while calcium pyrophosphate crystals cause arthritis in pseudogout.
Rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions of the joints, which lead to joint damage and cartilage breakdown.
Diabetes and other hormone disorders, which can cause inflammation that leads to osteoarthritis.

Smoking during pregnancy affects you and your baby's health before, during, and after your baby is born. The nicotine (the addictive substance in cigarettes), carbon monoxide, and numerous other poisons you inhale from a cigarette are carried through your bloodstream and go directly to your baby. Smoking while pregnant will:
Lower the amount of oxygen available to you and your growing baby
Increase your baby's heart rate
Increase the chances of miscarriage and stillbirth
Increase the risk that your baby is born prematurely or born with low birth weight
Increase your baby's risk of developing respiratory ( lung ) problems
Increases risks of birth defects
Increases risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)

It develops when your body uses up iron faster than it can be made, or when iron flow starts to slow down. Losing blood through internal bleeding, heavy menstruation, or frequent blood tests can cause iron-deficiency anemia. Pregnancy , breastfeeding, bone marrow diseases, autoimmune conditions, and not getting proper nutrition can all contribute as well. In fact, not eating enough is often how older people develop the condition.	0.95	0.9999186992645264	2026-01-26T22:07:57.755207

Iron-deficiency anemia, the most common form by far, makes up about half of all cases. Women and very young children get it the most. In fact, about 1 in 10 women of childbearing age, and nearly that many kids aged 1 to 3, have this condition. Iron-deficiency anemia is treatable. You can bring your iron back up with iron-rich foods, supplements, or medicine, depending on the cause and your doctor’s recommendations. But leaving it untreated can lead to a number of complications -- and even death. Here are eight problems iron-deficiency anemia can cause. Just as the name implies, iron-deficiency anemia happens when your iron is too low. Iron helps make hemoglobin, a substance in red blood cells that allows them to carry oxygen all over your body. When you don’t have enough iron, you won’t have enough hemoglobin to do this important work. If oxygen can’t get to the rest of your body, you may feel tired and short of breath as a result.	0.95	0.9988866448402405	2026-01-26T22:08:00.072732

These vessels may thicken, leak, develop clots, close off, or grow balloon-like defects called microaneurysms. Sometimes, fluid collects in the part of the retina used in tasks such as reading; this condition is called macular edema . In advanced cases, the retina is robbed of its blood supply and grows new, but defective, vessels, a process called neovascularization. These fragile vessels can bleed, creating vision-impairing hemorrhages, scar tissue, and separation of the retina from the back of the eye ( retinal detachment ).

Eye disease is a common condition that happens with diabetes. Blood sugar spikes can damage blood vessels throughout the body, including those in your eyes. Diabetic retinopathy is one type of eye disease caused by diabetes. It happens when your blood sugar is too high and damages your retina , the tissue that lines the inside of the eye. The retina’s job is to take in light and transfer signals to your brain via a nerve at the rear of your eye called the optic nerve. Small blood vessels connected to your retina leak fluid or bleed when sugar damages them. Your eyes do grow new blood vessels, but they’re weaker and have trouble keeping in blood and fluids.	0.95	0.987718939781189	2026-01-26T22:08:38.244880

Consistently high blood sugar harms blood vessels throughout your body, like in your heart, as well as the small blood vessels in your retina – the tissue at the back of your eye that sends images to your brain. Without healthy blood vessels, your retina can't work the way it's supposed to. Your body tries to help out by making more of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. In a healthy eye, this is not a problem. But in some conditions, too much of it weakens those blood vessels. In time, they can tear and leak blood and fluid into your retina. Your retina will swell and get thicker, a condition called diabetic retinopathy . The leaking fluid also causes swelling in the macula, the place in the center of the retina that gives you sharp, clear vision.	0.9499244093894958	0.9951902627944946	2026-01-26T22:08:40.735996

One of the most common eye conditions caused by diabetes is called diabetic retinopathy . This condition affects the retina , which is the layer of the eye that processes the images that you see. When blood sugar levels stay high for a long time in people with diabetes, it can damage small blood vessels . Damaged blood vessels can slowly leak fluid and blood into the retina. As diabetic retinopathy gets worse, the eye may begin to form new blood vessels to replace the leaky ones. This is called proliferative diabetic retinopathy.	0.9485571384429932	0.9991924166679382	2026-01-26T22:08:43.258826

You’ll still focus on the high traffic areas but disinfect more often to lower the risk of passing on the illness. Most EPA-registered disinfectants for home use work fine to fight common viral illnesses like seasonal flu and rhinovirus or the common cold , Seguin says. But for other types of infection, check the EPA website to see if a product fights other, perhaps more harmful, pathogens. While cleaning and disinfection should be on regular rotation, especially if someone’s sick, there’s no substitute for the most basic cleaning: your hands. “Remember, effective handwashing with soap and water is ultimately the best way to reduce the risk of viral transmission from person to environment and vice versa,” Seguin says.	0.9428474307060242	0.9463573694229126	2026-01-26T22:08:47.595655

Wash your hands frequently with soap and water. This is especially important after using the restroom, changing diapers, or touching surfaces in public places. Carry alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you when handwashing isn’t possible.
Try not to touch your mouth, nose, or eyes to avoid spreading germs.

Lower your stress through yoga, mindfulness , or deep breathing. These practices can help lower your blood pressure too.
Stop smoking (and vaping), which raises your risk for heart disease. Nicotine narrows blood vessels, forcing your heart to work harder. Quitting smoking is one of the most important lifestyle changes you can make to prevent damage to your heart from atherosclerosis.
Follow a healthy diet rich in low-fat proteins, fish, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. This will help you manage your weight and lower cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels.
Lose weight and keep it off. Even a small amount will help lower your risk.
Exercise regularly to maintain a healthy blood pressure and improve blood flow. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of brisk exercise a week.

It helps get glucose — a sugar made from the food you eat — into cells in your muscles, liver, and fat, where it’s used for energy or stored for later. When insulin resistance develops, those cells require more than normal amount of insulin to take in the glucose they need. If your pancreas does not make enough insulin, the glucose will remain in your bloodstream, elevating your blood sugar (or blood glucose) level. Eventually, this can lead to diabetes . Insulin resistance is closely connected to having excess weight in the belly.

Takeaways	https://www.webmd.com/obesity/cm/insulin-resistance-weight	Alyson Powell Key	Melinda  Ratini, MS, DO	2025-06-19	Insulin is a hormone that helps move glucose, or blood sugar, into your body’s cells for energy. When your cells don’t respond well to insulin, known as insulin resistance, your body makes more insulin to try to fix the problem. High levels of insulin in your blood can lead to fat storage and make it harder to lose weight. Your diet plays a key role in insulin resistance. Other lifestyle changes to manage insulin resistance include getting enough exercise (both cardio and resistance training) and quality sleep, as well as lowering your stress levels.	0.95	0.4568948745727539	2026-01-26T22:09:59.266837

Two decades ago, if you asked a diabetes specialist to explain the cause of type 2 diabetes , they would say insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that helps the glucose in your blood enter cells in your muscle, fat, and liver, where it’s used for energy. But when you have insulin resistance, these muscle, fat, and liver cells don’t respond well to it. As a result, your pancreas has to make more and more insulin to compensate. Over time, this can lead to type 2 diabetes.	0.95	0.41650471091270447	2026-01-26T22:10:00.766367

One of these is a condition called fatty liver disease. Fatty liver disease is an illness in which fat builds up in the liver. It happens because your liver can’t process and rid itself of fat efficiently. There are two basic types of fatty liver disease: Alcoholic fatty liver disease happens when heavy drinking damages your liver and makes it less able to break down fat. The other more common type isn’t related to alcohol use. It was long called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), because it’s found in people who drink little if any alcohol at all. Doctors and researchers now refer to it as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). A number of things can increase your chances of getting MASLD. But having obesity may be the most common risk factor of all. In fact, up to two-thirds of people with MASLD have obesity. Fat buildup can eventually damage your liver, prevent it from functioning properly, and may result in liver failure. Research also suggests there’s a strong link between MASLD and diseases of your heart and blood vessels. The encouraging news is that MASLD is treatable and can even be reversed. The key is catching the disease early and taking action.	0.95	0.9938645958900452	2026-01-26T22:11:21.260126

Insulin resistance. It’s estimated that between 50% and 80% of people with both PCOS and fatty liver disease also have insulin resistance, which means their body has a hard time breaking down sugar.
Obesity. Between 40% and 80% of people with PCOS also have obesity, which makes them more likely to develop SLD.
Hyperandrogenemia. High levels of male hormones (androgens) in a female body can lead to insulin resistance, a key trait in both PCOS and fatty liver disease.
Type 2 diabetes. The insulin resistance often seen in people with PCOS and fatty liver disease can progress to diabetes.
Sleep apnea. Sleep apnea lowers the amount of oxygen a person gets during sleep, which causes inflammation and lowers the amount of proteins that help control blood sugar and fat metabolism. These changes can lead to insulin resistance and fat buildup in the liver.

Fat cells also contribute to inflammation, which can lead to plaque buildup in your arteries and add to your risk of insulin resistance, high blood pressure, heart disease, and blood vessel disease.	0.95	0.9660392999649048	2026-01-26T22:11:27.784626

However, hepatitis C is more likely to develop into a chronic condition, which puts you at risk for cirrhosis and liver cancer.

In that respect, hepatitis C may be worse because although it's easy to cure, it may cause serious complications if you don't know you have it.	0.95	0.9859285950660706	2026-01-26T22:12:43.411314

Generally, the higher the dosage, the more a statin will lower your LDL cholesterol levels. But some statins can bring your LDL to a certain level at a lower dose. Statin therapy is classified as low, moderate, or high intensity, depending on how much a certain drug can lower LDL at a given dosage. Your doctor will prescribe a statin based on your unique risk of cardiovascular disease.

Tangier disease: This genetic condition (inherited from parents) causes low levels of HDL cholesterol.
Familial combined hyperlipidemia: People with this inherited condition (passed on from one or both parents) have trouble processing cholesterol. That means HDL cholesterol can be too low and LDL can be too high.
Metabolic syndrome: If you have metabolic syndrome, low HDL may be part of it. Multiple health conditions combine in this syndrome and increase risk of heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and stroke.
Overweight/obesity: If you have extra weight, or a body mass index (BMI) higher than 25, your HDL cholesterol is likely to be lower. In addition, lower levels of HDL cholesterol are associated with obesity, especially fat around the abdomen.
Smoking or tobacco use: The nicotine in tobacco lowers your HDL. All tobacco products include nicotine, including e-cigarettes.

It progresses differently in everyone. Your kidneys might still work well years later. Or you could quickly develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD), also known as end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure. This means your kidneys can no longer filter waste. The good news is that there are ways to slow the damage. Ask your nephrologist (kidney doctor) which medications might work for you and if there are other ways you can protect your kidneys.	0.9488235712051392	0.5010373592376709	2026-01-26T22:13:30.764825

Almost everyone with late-stage chronic kidney disease also has high blood pressure. Having high blood pressure for a long time damages the filters in your kidneys and can speed the progression to kidney failure. Because the kidneys control blood pressure, when they're damaged your blood pressure can go even higher. Work with your doctor to find the right blood pressure-lowering treatment.

Most often seen in older people with atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), renal artery stenosis can worsen over time, often leading to hypertension (high blood pressure) and kidney damage. With less blood reaching the kidneys , the body mistakes it for low blood pressure . This signals the kidneys to release hormones that lead to an increase in blood pressure .

And oftentimes, you see those types of viruses causing more severe disease in really young children or older adults, because their lungs are not as good at preventing those types of infections. And so, that's what's happening with RSV. We have normally heard of it as something that affects babies, because it is one of those things that during this, as I say, flu season, where you see a lot of babies that are getting severely ill and ending up in the hospital wheezing from RSV. But RSV is certainly a culprit of severe illness in older people as well, specifically those that are over the age of 75.	0.95	0.9357534050941467	2026-01-26T22:13:57.304569

But you can get it at any age. And if you’re older than 60, you’re at even greater risk for RSV . “The virus is increasingly recognized as a significant cause of respiratory illness in older adults in the U.S.,” says William Schaffner, MD, a spokesperson and former medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. The CDC estimates that 177,000 older adults are hospitalized every year and 14,000 die from RSV infections. It is a highly contagious respiratory virus. That means it spreads very easily. RSV infects your nose, throat, lungs, and breathing passages. You’ll have symptoms like those of a common cold. RSV can be easily dismissed as a cold in people who are healthy. It’s also easy to confuse RSV with other viruses, like the flu and COVID-19. Loved ones and caregivers should be aware of the chance that RSV in older adults can cause serious sickness or may even be fatal.	0.95	0.8668427467346191	2026-01-26T22:13:59.771414

RSV is a leading cause of major respiratory tract illness among adults in the U.S., along with the flu and COVID-19. People with heart disease, lung problems, or other serious medical conditions that weaken their immune systems are at greater risk for serious RSV complications. And if you have asthma, COPD, or heart failure, RSV can make your condition worse. For older adults and people with ongoing health conditions, RSV can lead to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs’ air sacs. Bronchiolitis – inflammation of the lungs’ small airways – is another common complication in older adults who get the virus.	0.95	0.9121120572090149	2026-01-26T22:14:01.632668

With it, you’ll get cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose and cough. Many people get over RSV within a week or two, usually without treatment. But for older adults and infants, RSV can lead to serious, sometimes life-threatening complications. This is especially true for people with respiratory conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd ) and asthma . It can also become very serious for people who have cardiovascular disease or another type of heart disease. Because RSV symptoms are like those of the common cold or flu, you may think it’s OK to dismiss them as relatively harmless. But at the first sign that symptoms are getting worse, you should get medical attention to lower your risk of getting pneumonia or other serious health problems. You can get RSV throughout the year. But it’s most common in the winter months through the spring (roughly November to April or May). It coincides with the peak of flu season. Most babies have at least one RSV infection by the time they’re 2. You can get it again at any age. It’s unusual for it to cause a very serious illness in older kids and most adults. But by age 65, the health risks are greater.	0.95	0.9414740204811096	2026-01-26T22:14:08.801097

Despite the rash, measles is actually a respiratory disease which effects your breathing. It causes coughing, sneezing, high fevers, and possibly pneumonia. The infection can be deadly. Up to 90% of those who are not immune will also become infected when near someone with measles who is contagious, so it is important to get the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. The symptoms appear 7 to 14 days after contact with the virus with the rash appearing 3 to 5 days after the first symptoms.	0.95	0.9939517378807068	2026-01-26T22:14:19.776125

Ear infections . This is a very common complication caused by bacteria. Sometimes these ear infections cause permanent hearing loss.
B ronchitis, laryngitis, or croup. Often, the measles virus causes inflammation in your voice box or bronchial tubes, the air passageways to your lungs.
Diarrhea. Less than 1 out of every 10 people with measles gets diarrhea.
Pneumonia. You can get a severe infection of your lungs.
Encephalitis , a brain infection that can cause deafness and brain damage. About 1 in 1,000 people with measles gets it. You might get it right away or months after your infection.

Although it is rarely a serious disease to otherwise healthy children, the symptoms last about 2 weeks and can make the child very uncomfortable. In addition, chickenpox can be a serious illness in people with weak immune systems, such as newborns, people on chemotherapy for cancer, people taking steroids, pregnant women, the elderly, or those with HIV . A safe and effective vaccine is now available to children ages 1 and older to prevent chickenpox. It takes up to 21 days to develop chickenpox after being exposed to the virus by inhaling infected droplets from coughs or sneezes or by coming in direct contact with the lesions on an infected person with chickenpox or from someone with shingles.
Symptoms The symptoms of chickenpox often begin with a very itchy rash, which first appears on the scalp, chest, back and face then spreads to the rest of the body. The rash begins as an area of redness with a small, superficial blister in the center. The blister eventually ruptures with some possible drainage, and the lesion will then form a crust. Other associated symptoms include fever, malaise, sore throat , and red eyes. Fever and malaise may precede the rash in some cases.
Treatment The virus is spread primarily from the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth of the child, but the rash itself is also contagious. The child remains contagious and cannot go to school or daycare until the last lesion has appeared and is fully crusted over. No therapy treats chickenpox once it has begun, but your doctor can provide prescriptions and advice to help with the discomfort and the itching. Never give aspirin to a child in general but especially one with chickenpox. A deadly disease called Reye's syndrome has been associated with children taking aspirin, especially if they have chickenpox. Be sure to check the contents of any other over-the-counter medications for aspirin or salicylates because these are often found mixed with over-the-counter cold medications. Chickenpox can occasionally affect the cornea, the clear front portion of the eye. If your child develops chickenpox on the tip of the nose  it is usually a precursor to having the eyes infected. See your doctor immediately. See a doctor immediately also if your child develops lesions in the genital regions internally or inside of the mouth."	0.95	0.8356353044509888	2026-01-26T22:14:32.215846

Certain strains of HPV are linked to cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, and rectum. Other strains cause genital warts. Genital warts are usually not a major health risk, and there are several ways to treat them. Your doctor may suggest a topical medication or a procedure to remove genital warts. Getting treatment right away can reduce the symptoms of genital warts, which can include itching and discomfort. Once you have HPV, the infection itself can't be treated.

More than half of all bleeding ulcers are caused by NSAIDs, says gastroenterologist Byron Cryer, MD, a spokesperson for the American Gastroenterological Association. ""Gastrointestinal bleeding is a serious issue,"" says Cryer. ""But we've seen in many surveys that people really underestimate this risk."" Most ulcers caused by NSAIDs will heal once you stop taking the drug, according to the American College of Gastroenterology. Researchers developed Cox-2 inhibitors to get around this problem, says Klippel. Contrary to common belief, Cox-2 inhibitors are not more powerful painkillers than standard NSAIDs. Their advantage is they are much less likely to cause gastrointestinal problems. Two of them – Bextra and Vioxx – are no longer sold because of concerns that they raised users' risks for heart problems. Bextra also posed a risk of serious skin reactions.

Obesity. The extra weight in your neck can press down on your airway, causing breathing problems.
Age. As you get older, fat can build around your airway and cause apnea.
Jaw issues. An underbite or very small lower jaw can affect your airway, increasing your risk for apnea.
Large or swollen tonsils, tongue, or adenoids. These structural issues can block your airway, making it hard to breathe. The risk for apnea also increases if your neck circumference is greater than 16 inches.
Genetics. Your genes affect many things, including the size and shape of your head. Because of this, sleep apnea can run in families. In addition, genetic conditions such as Down syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome can affect the way your head and neck are shaped.
Endocrine problems. Hormones influence the shape of your face, airway, and skull. For example, low thyroid hormones, high insulin, or high growth factor levels can contribute to sleep apnea.
Heart or kidney failure. These problems can lead to fluid settling in your neck, disrupting your airway.
Drinking or smoking. Alcohol causes the muscles in your upper airway to relax, causing it to narrow. Meanwhile, smoking can lead to redness and swelling (inflammation) in your airway."	0.95	0.9990814924240112	2026-01-26T22:16:53.590235

Johnson, MD	2024-11-09	"Important risk factors for osteoporosis include:
Age. After maximum bone density and strength is reached (generally around age 30), bone mass begins to naturally decline with age.
Gender. Women over the age of 50 have the greatest risk of developing osteoporosis. In fact, women are four times more likely than men to develop osteoporosis. Women's lighter, thinner bones and longer life spans account for some of the reasons why they are at a higher risk for osteoporosis.
Ethnicity. Research has shown that Caucasian and Asian women are more likely to develop osteoporosis. Additionally, hip fractures are twice as likely to occur in Caucasian women as in African-American women. However, women of color who fracture their hips have a higher mortality.
Bone structure and body weight . Petite and thin women have a greater risk of developing osteoporosis in part because they have less bone to lose than women with more body weight and larger frames. Similarly, small-boned, thin men are at greater risk than men with larger frames and more body weight.
Family history. Heredity is one of the most important risk factors for osteoporosis. If your parents or grandparents have had any signs of osteoporosis , such as a fractured hip after a minor fall, you may be at greater risk of developing the disease.
Prior history of fracture/bone breakage.
Certain medications . The use of some medications, such as the long term use of steroids (like prednisone ) can also increase your risk of developing osteoporosis.
Some medical conditions : Some diseases including cancer and stroke may increase your risk for osteoporosis."	0.95	0.9938101172447205	2026-01-26T22:17:17.969630

Zelman, RD, LD, MPH	2025-07-25	"Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus from the food you eat. So the nutrient is especially important for people with osteoporosis. Studies show that calcium and vitamin D together can build stronger bones in women after menopause. It also helps with other disorders that cause weak bones, like rickets. If you’re concerned about your bone health, ask your doctor if you should think about taking a supplement. People who have low levels of vitamin D also may need supplements. That includes those who:
Are over 50
Get very little sun
Have kidney disease or conditions that affect how their bodies absorb minerals
Have darker skin
Are lactose intolerant , meaning they can’t digest the sugar in dairy foods
Are vegan
Are infants who eat only breast milk
Those who take certain anticonvulsant drugs"	0.95	0.9994992017745972	2026-01-26T22:17:33.652513

Age. After maximum bone density and strength is reached (generally around age 30), bone mass begins to naturally decline with age.
Gender. Women over the age of 50 have the greatest risk of developing osteoporosis. In fact, women are four times more likely than men to develop osteoporosis. Women's lighter, thinner bones and longer life spans account for some of the reasons why they are at a higher risk for osteoporosis.
Ethnicity. Research has shown that Caucasian and Asian women are more likely to develop osteoporosis. Additionally, hip fractures are twice as likely to occur in Caucasian women as in African-American women. However, women of color who fracture their hips have a higher mortality.
Bone structure and body weight . Petite and thin women have a greater risk of developing osteoporosis in part because they have less bone to lose than women with more body weight and larger frames. Similarly, small-boned, thin men are at greater risk than men with larger frames and more body weight.
Family history. Heredity is one of the most important risk factors for osteoporosis. If your parents or grandparents have had any signs of osteoporosis , such as a fractured hip after a minor fall, you may be at greater risk of developing the disease.
Prior history of fracture/bone breakage.

How Osteoporosis Affects the Hispanic Community	https://www.webmd.com/osteoporosis/cm/osteoporosis-causes				It is a common belief that Hispanic people have a lower risk of osteoporosis compared to the non-Hispanic White population. But recent data have shown that Hispanic people may have a similar or even higher prevalence of osteoporosis. Risk factors for osteoporosis in the Hispanic community include: Eating traditional diets low in calcium, vitamin D, and zinc. Living a sedentary lifestyle, smoking, or drinking alcohol — behaviors noted in some Hispanic communities studied. Facing cultural barriers, such as limited English proficiency or reduced access to health care in low-income areas. Having limited knowledge about osteoporosis. Some studies found greater concern about other chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes. Lacking education about bone health, the value of physical activity, and ways to prevent osteoporosis early.	0.9472359418869019	0.9926339983940125	2026-01-26T22:17:57.945731

Vasculitis . A condition in which blood vessels or the blood vessel walls become inflamed. It causes the wall to thicken which can restrict blood flow. In some cases vasculitis is thought to be an autoimmune disease, which means the body comes under attack by its own immune system . In vasculitis, the immune system attacks blood vessels.
Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). It’s a type of autoimmune condition that causes clots in veins and arteries. APS can also cause miscarriages.
Hypertension. Also known as high blood pressure, it’s the pressure your blood exerts on the walls of the arteries. This causes damage to the vessel wall and blood flow, which can lead to clot formation.
Premature atherosclerosis . It’s a condition that hardens and narrows your arteries . It can happen when you’re relatively young. The arteries over time can become blocked, which cuts off normal blood flow.
Chronic inflammatory diseases. When you’re sick or injured, your immune system sends out inflammatory cells to destroy bacteria or repair damaged cells. But if your body releases these cells when you’re not sick or injured, this causes chronic inflammation. Inflammation increases the chance of stroke.
Libman-Sacks endocarditis. It happens when the endocardium, the innermost layer of your heart, is injured and it becomes inflamed. It’s a common condition to have along with lupus.
Immune deposits in your body. When foreign particles called antigens, like a virus or bacteria, enter your body, your immune system releases antibodies to fight them. The antibodies bind to antigens to create immune complexes which may deposit themselves in organs or blood. It’s part of your normal immune response but if there’s too much build-up, it can cause issues like vasculitis."	0.9341686964035034	0.5936651229858398	2026-01-26T22:18:12.895416

Drugs that increase insulin production by the pancreas, including chlorpropamide (Diabinese), glimepiride, (Amaryl), glipizide (Glucotrol), glyburide ( DiaBeta , Glynase), nateglinide (Starlix), and repaglinide (Prandin)
Drugs that decrease sugar absorption by the intestines, such as acarbose (Precose) and miglitol (Glyset)
Drugs that improve how the body uses insulin, such as pioglitazone (Actos) and rosiglitazone (Avandia)
Drugs that decrease sugar production by the liver and improve insulin resistance, like metformin (Glucophage). Metformin causes weight loss and this is one of the ways it helps bring blood sugars back to normal.
Drugs that increase insulin production by the pancreas or its blood levels and/or reduce sugar production from the liver, including alogliptin ( Nesina ), dulaglutide (Trulicity), exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon), linagliptin (Tradjenta), liraglutide (Victoza), lixisenatide ( Adlyxin ), saxagliptin ( Onglyza ), semaglutide (Ozempic), sitagliptin ( Januvia ), and tirzepatide ( Mounjaro ).
Drugs that block the reabsorption of glucose by the kidney and increase glucose excretions in urine, called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. They also trigger weight loss which helps bring blood sugars back to normal. They are canaglifozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), empagliflozin (Jardiance), and ertugliflozin ( Steglatro ) .

According to the CDC, if you've already had a baby with a neural tube defect, getting enough folic acid may reduce your risk of having another child with a neural tube defect by as much as 70%.

Red blood cell transfusion. A low red blood cell count could lead to conditions such as anemia and iron deficiency. A red blood cell transfusion is necessary to increase iron, hemoglobin, and oxygen concentration in the blood.
Platelet cell transfusion. Platelets are crucial in stopping the bleeding process to prevent excessive blood loss.

Cholesterol is found mainly in meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products. The 2020 Dietary Guidelines no longer recommend limiting cholesterol in the diet, due to a lack of evidence that dietary cholesterol - that from meat and dairy products, for example -- raises cholesterol in the blood .
Saturated fat comes primarily from foods of animal origin such as dairy products, meat, butter, cheeses, poultry, and luncheon meats. It is also found in tropical oils such as coconut oil and palm oil . Choose nonfat or low-fat dairy, lean meats, and skinless poultry to reduce saturated fat intake. Too much saturated fat can raise the cholesterol level in the blood and increase the risk of heart disease.
Trans fats are formed during the process of ""partial hydrogenation,"" a manufacturing technique that turns liquid oils into partially solid products. These fats can be found in some vegetable shortening, margarine, crackers, candies, cookies, snack foods, fried foods, baked goods, and other processed foods. Eating too many trans fats raises the cholesterol level in the blood.
Polyunsaturated fat comes from many plant foods, nuts, seeds, some plant oils (sunflower, corn, soybean), some seafood (herring, salmon , mackerel ,
halibut), and soybeans. Polyunsaturated fat is a healthy fat and includes heart -healthy omega-3 fatty acids.
Monounsaturated fat comes from some plant foods, including olives and olive oil, canola oil , peanuts, and avocados. New research suggests that these fats help reduce your risk of heart disease."	0.95	0.8413739800453186	2026-01-26T22:19:58.753677

Overweight/obesity: If you have extra weight, or a body mass index (BMI) higher than 25, your HDL cholesterol is likely to be lower. In addition, lower levels of HDL cholesterol are associated with obesity, especially fat around the abdomen.

Diet. Saturated fat , trans fat, carbohydrates, and cholesterol in the food you eat increase cholesterol levels. Reducing the amount of saturated fat , trans fats , and sugars in your diet helps lower your blood cholesterol leve l. Increasing the amount of fiber and plant-derived sterols can also help lower LDL cholesterol .
Weight. In addition to being a risk factor for heart disease, being overweight can also increase your cholesterol. Losing weight can help lower your LDL, total cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels, as well as raise your HDL.
Exercise. Regular exercise can lower LDL cholesterol and raise HDL cholesterol . You should try to be physically active for 30 minutes every day.
Age and Gender. As we get older, cholesterol levels rise. Before menopause, women tend to have lower total cholesterol levels than men of the same age. After menopause , however, women's LDL levels tend to rise.
Heredity. Your genes partly determine how much cholesterol your body makes. High blood cholesterol can run in families.
Medical conditions. Occasionally, a medical condition may cause an elevation of cholesterol levels in the blood. These include hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland), liver disease, and kidney disease .

Some health conditions. Diabetes, chronic kidney disease, familial hypercholesterolemia, and HIV can lead to high LDL.
Some medications. Certain drugs, especially those used to control blood pressure or HIV, can cause high LDL as a side effect.
Fatty foods. Red and processed meats, full-fat dairy, fast foods, fried foods, and some sweets are high in saturated and trans fats. These fats are known to increase LDL cholesterol.
Lack of exercise. Not getting enough physical activity can cause you to gain weight, which increases your risk for high cholesterol.
High body weight. Being overweight or having obesity can bring up your cholesterol levels.

Cholesterol is found mainly in meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products. The 2020 Dietary Guidelines no longer recommend limiting cholesterol in the diet, due to a lack of evidence that dietary cholesterol - that from meat and dairy products, for example -- raises cholesterol in the blood .
Saturated fat comes primarily from foods of animal origin such as dairy products, meat, butter, cheeses, poultry, and luncheon meats. It is also found in tropical oils such as coconut oil and palm oil . Choose nonfat or low-fat dairy, lean meats, and skinless poultry to reduce saturated fat intake. Too much saturated fat can raise the cholesterol level in the blood and increase the risk of heart disease.
Trans fats are formed during the process of ""partial hydrogenation,"" a manufacturing technique that turns liquid oils into partially solid products. These fats can be found in some vegetable shortening, margarine, crackers, candies, cookies, snack foods, fried foods, baked goods, and other processed foods. Eating too many trans fats raises the cholesterol level in the blood.
Polyunsaturated fat comes from many plant foods, nuts, seeds, some plant oils (sunflower, corn, soybean), some seafood (herring, salmon , mackerel ,
halibut), and soybeans. Polyunsaturated fat is a healthy fat and includes heart -healthy omega-3 fatty acids.
Monounsaturated fat comes from some plant foods, including olives and olive oil, canola oil , peanuts, and avocados. New research suggests that these fats help reduce your risk of heart disease."	0.95	0.6844691634178162	2026-01-26T22:20:21.645364

King, PhD	Poonam  Sachdev	2024-05-02	Lactose intolerance. It is when your body makes too little of a digestive enzyme called lactase. Lactase helps you break down the sugar lactose present in dairy. People who're lactose intolerant often have gas, bloating, and diarrhea , usually about 30 minutes to 2 hours after drinking milk or eating dairy. Your symptoms may be mild or severe depending on how much lactase your body makes. Your doctor can diagnose you with a blood sugar, stool (poop) acidity, or hydrogen breath test.	0.95	0.9999285936355591	2026-01-26T22:20:53.697122

However, the development of lactose intolerance tends to increase with age. Symptoms include bloating , pain, gas, diarrhea or gastroesophageal reflux.

It happens when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the lining of the colon, leading to swelling and irritation. This can cause symptoms like diarrhea , blood in your stool, stomach cramps, or an urgent need to poop. To diagnose ulcerative colitis, doctors use an endoscope – a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached – to examine the colon. They might perform a colonoscopy , which provides a full view of the colon, or a sigmoidoscopy, which focuses on the lower part. During the procedure, they take a small tissue sample (called a biopsy) to check for inflammation and other signs of the disease under a microscope. While additional tests can rule out other types of inflammatory bowel disease, a biopsy is the only way to confirm an ulcerative colitis diagnosis with certainty.	0.95	0.9989957213401794	2026-01-26T22:21:38.247708

Over time, the LES can begin to stop working and lead to acid and chemical damage of the esophagus, called gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ).	0.95	0.9820484519004822	2026-01-26T22:21:46.830991

Damage to Your Esophagus	https://www.webmd.com/heartburn-gerd/untreated-heartburn	WebMD Editorial Contributors	Sabrina  Felson, MD	2024-03-08	"When the acid flows back up, it enters the esophagus, a tube that connects your mouth to your stomach. This can set the stage for:
Esophagitis : Stomach acid irritates the lining of the esophagus, causing it to swell. This inflammation is called esophagitis, which can lead to painful swallowing.
Esophageal ulcers: GERD is the top cause of ulcers, or sores in the lining of the esophagus. Symptoms include painful swallowing, nausea , and chest pain . Your doctor will prescribe medicine to control your GERD and treat the ulcer.
Esophageal stricture: Over time, the damage caused by stomach acid can scar the lining of the esophagus. When this scar tissue builds up, it makes the esophagus narrow. Called strictures, these narrow spots make it hard to swallow food and drinks, which can lead to weight loss and dehydration . Strictures are treated with a procedure that gently stretches your esophagus.
Barrett’s esophagus: About 5% to 10% of people with GERD develop this condition, where stomach acid causes precancerous changes in cells. The good news is that only 1% of people with Barrett’s esophagus will get esophageal cancer . Doctors can remove the abnormal cells when they diagnose you early on. Because the condition doesn’t cause any obvious symptoms, you should see your doctor if you have GERD. They may do a procedure called an endoscopy, where a thin, flexible tube with a camera is inserted into your esophagus."	0.95	0.8349205851554871	2026-01-26T22:21:50.509114

Age . While being over 50 raises your chances of Barrett's esophagus, most people are in their 60s when they're diagnosed with the condition. The average age at diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is 55 years.

Between the esophagus and the stomach, there is a valve called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). It keeps stomach contents from rising up into the esophagus and prevents a back flow (reflux) of stomach acid. Over time, the LES can begin to stop working and lead to acid and chemical damage of the esophagus, called gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ).	0.9417115449905396	0.9144272208213806	2026-01-26T22:22:07.565430

There are two main types of asthma medications :
Anti-inflammatories: These medications are the most important for most people with asthma. Anti-inflammatory medications, such as inhaled steroids , reduce swelling and mucus production in the airways. As a result, airways are less sensitive and less likely to react to triggers. These medications need to be taken daily, and they may need to be taken for several weeks before they begin to co ntrol asthma. Anti-inflammatories lead to fewer symptoms, better airflow, less sensitive airways, less airway damage, and fewer asthma episodes. If taken every day, they help control or prevent asthma flares. Oral steroids are taken for acute flares, help other medications work better, and help reduce inflammation .
Bronchodilators: These medications relax the muscle bands that tighten around the airways. This action rapidly opens the airways, letting more air in and out of the lungs and improving bre athing. As the airwa ys open, mucus moves more freely and can be coughed out more easily. Both short-acting and long-acting beta-agonists can be used to prevent symptoms of exercise-induced asthma. An anticholinergic, such as tiotropium bromide ( Spiriva Respimat), which is available for people ages 6 and older, is another long-term maintenance medication for treating asthma."	0.95	0.694301962852478	2026-01-26T22:22:49.544432

Your doctor may suggest you combine an inhaled corticosteroid, an anti-inflammatory drug, with one or more other drugs such as:
Long-acting beta-agonists. A beta-agonist is a type of drug called a bronchodilator, which opens your airways.
Long-acting anticholinergics . Anticholinergics relax and enlarge (dilate) the airways in the lungs, making breathing easier.
Leukotriene modifiers. These drugs block chemicals that cause inflammation.
Mast cell stabilizers. Mast cell stabilizers curb the release of chemicals that cause inflammation.
Theophylline . Theophylline is a bronchodilator used as an add-on medication for symptoms that are not responding to other medications.
I mmunomodulator. This is a shot you get if you have moderate-to-severe asthma related to allergies or other inflammation caused by the immune system that doesn’t respond to certain drugs."	0.95	0.7962470650672913	2026-01-26T22:22:55.366330

Bronchodilators. You usually inhale these medicines. They help open your airways.
Corticosteroids. These drugs reduce airway inflammation. You could inhale them or take them as pills.
Combination inhalers. These inhalers pair steroids with one or more bronchodilators.
Antibiotics. Your doctor might prescribe these to fight bacterial infections.
Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors, such as roflumilast (Daliresp). This drug stops an enzyme called PDE4. It prevents flare-ups in people whose COPD is linked to chronic bronchitis.
Anticholinergics. These drugs relax airways and help clear mucus from the lungs. They work more slowly than bronchodilators.
Leukotriene modifiers. These drugs interfere with natural chemicals in the body that tighten airways and increase mucus and fluid.
Theophylline. This is a bronchodilator you can take as a pill or liquid. Because low doses haven't proven effective and high doses come with side effects, including nausea and headaches, it's usually only used when other treatments aren't working or are too expensive for you.
Antihistamines. If you have allergy symptoms such as stuffiness, watery eyes, and sneezing, these drugs can help -- but they can also dry your airways, causing more coughing
Antivirals. If you get a treatable viral illness, like the flu or COVID-19, your doctor can prescribe these drugs to lessen the risk of COPD complications
Flu, pneumonia, and COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines lower your risk for respiratory illnesses that can make your COPD worse."	0.95	0.4126400053501129	2026-01-26T22:22:56.944734

Fortunately, great strides have been made in the HIV prevention and care. Improved awareness of the disease, access to testing, and availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medicine can help prevent you from getting HIV. And antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress the virus low enough that it can prevent you from spreading it to others if you have it. Yet research shows that certain groups, especially Black and Hispanic people, are less likely to use these preventative measures and have higher rates of infection than other groups. And they’re also more likely to have worse outcomes. Here’s a look at the different factors that contribute to racial, gender, and sexual disparities in HIV infections and prevention and care.	0.95	0.9966675639152527	2026-01-26T22:23:23.241786

There are several stages and forms of the disease:
Primary TB. This is the first stage of a tuberculosis infection. Your immune system may be able to fight off the germs. But sometimes it doesn't destroy all of them, and they keep multiplying. You may not have any TB symptoms at this stage, or you might have a few flu-like symptoms.
Latent TB. You have the germs in your body, but your immune system keeps them from spreading. You don’t have any symptoms, and you’re not contagious. But the infection is still alive and can one day become active. If you’re at high risk for reactivation, your doctor will give you medications to prevent active TB. This usually happens if you have HIV , you had an infection in the past 2 years, your chest X-ray is unusual, or your immune system is weakened.
Active TB. The germs multiply and make you sick. You can spread the disease to others. Some 90% of active cases in adults come from a latent TB infection.
Active TB outside the lungs. A tuberculosis infection that spreads from your lungs to other parts of the body is known as extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Your symptoms will depend on which part of your body the infection affects."	0.95	0.9950780868530273	2026-01-26T22:23:42.916306

They include:
Drugs that increase insulin production by the pancreas, including chlorpropamide (Diabinese), glimepiride, (Amaryl), glipizide (Glucotrol), glyburide ( DiaBeta , Glynase), nateglinide (Starlix), and repaglinide (Prandin)
Drugs that decrease sugar absorption by the intestines, such as acarbose (Precose) and miglitol (Glyset)
Drugs that improve how the body uses insulin, such as pioglitazone (Actos) and rosiglitazone (Avandia)
Drugs that decrease sugar production by the liver and improve insulin resistance, like metformin (Glucophage). Metformin causes weight loss and this is one of the ways it helps bring blood sugars back to normal.
Drugs that increase insulin production by the pancreas or its blood levels and/or reduce sugar production from the liver, including alogliptin ( Nesina ), dulaglutide (Trulicity), exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon), linagliptin (Tradjenta), liraglutide (Victoza), lixisenatide ( Adlyxin ), saxagliptin ( Onglyza ), semaglutide (Ozempic), sitagliptin ( Januvia ), and tirzepatide ( Mounjaro ).
Drugs that block the reabsorption of glucose by the kidney and increase glucose excretions in urine, called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. They also trigger weight loss which helps bring blood sugars back to normal. They are canaglifozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), empagliflozin (Jardiance), and ertugliflozin ( Steglatro ) . These drugs can also help reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure and cardiovascular death in patients with heart failure.
Pramlinitide (Symlin) is an injectable synthetic hormone. It helps lower blood sugar after meals in people with diabetes who use insulin."	0.9489390850067139	0.9915830492973328	2026-01-26T22:26:02.060586

Preventive care : Dental experts recommend you get regular cleanings and checkups once every 6 months to maintain your oral health. Preventive care includes regular exams, cleanings, fluoride rinses, and oral cancer screenings. X-rays are also part of preventive care. These services help prevent dental issues from developing and catch issues early before they get worse.
Basic or restorative care: This includes simple fillings , crowns, and tooth extractions to help treat cavities, gingivitis, or other oral infections. Most dental plans usually cover any X-rays needed to complete these procedures.
Major dental care: Some restorative care involves more complex invasive procedures that may require the use of anesthesia or oral surgery. Major dental care may cover: Endodontics or root canals. Periodontics, the care of the structures that support and surround the tooth. This includes scaling, root planing, and managing acute infections or lesions. Prosthodontics, such as dentures and bridges. Oral surgery, such as removing impacted wisdom teeth, tissue biopsy, and draining minor oral infections. Some full-coverage dental insurance may even cover dental implants.
Orthodontic care: Some full-coverage dental plans cover orthodontia, such as braces, retainers, or aligners, but usually only for children."	0.95	0.6374620795249939	2026-01-26T22:26:39.593009

Most experts recommend a dental check-up every 6 months -- more often if you have problems like gum disease. During a routine exam, your dentist or dental hygienist removes plaque build-up that you can’t brush or floss away and look for signs of decay. A regular dental exam also spots:
Early signs of oral cancer. Nine out of 10 cases of oral cancer can be treated if found early enough. Undetected, oral cancer can spread to other parts of the body and become harder to treat.
Wear and tear from tooth grinding. Called bruxism , teeth grinding may be caused by stress or anxiety. Over time, it can wear down the biting surfaces of teeth, making them more susceptible to decay. If your teeth show signs of bruxism, your dentist may recommend a mouth guard worn at night to prevent grinding.
Signs of gum disease. Gum disease, also called gingivitis or periodontitis, is the leading cause of tooth loss in older people. “Unfortunately, by the time most people notice any of the warning signs of periodontitis, it’s too late to reverse the damage,” says Sam Low, DDS, professor of periodontology at the University of Florida and president of the American Academy of Periodontology. Periodically, your dental professional should examine your gums for signs of trouble.
Interactions with medications. Older patients, especially those on multiple medications, are at risk of dry mouth, or xerostomia . Reduced saliva flow increases the risk of decay and gum problems. As many as 800 different drugs cause dry mouth as a side effect, says Iacopino, dean of the University of Manitoba Faculty of Dentistry. “Always tell your dental professional about any medications you take,” he says. A change in prescriptions may help alleviate the problem. Saliva-like oral mouthwashes are also available."	0.9459870457649231	0.8023435473442078	2026-01-26T22:26:44.516040

Heart health: Moderate to severe gum disease has been shown to increase inflammation levels throughout the entire body. Some studies suggest that inflammation from severe gum disease may be linked to the risk of stroke as well as heart disease, which is also an inflammatory disease.
Lung health: Some research suggests that periodontal health may help promote lung health for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). Periodontal disease can also increase the risk of respiratory infections such as pneumonia . This may occur from inhaling bacteria into the respiratory tract.
Nutritional health: If you lose teeth from gum disease, it may become harder to eat healthy foods such as crisp fruits and vegetables . Chewing problems can lead to poor nutrition, which, in turn, can cause other problems, including fatigue and dizziness.
Emotional health: Your smile is your calling card to the world. And most of us feel more confident when they have an attractive smile.

Here are some tips to doing so: Reduce your risk. Some risks of thrombosis, like PNH, can’t be controlled, but there are lifestyle factors that increase the risks. These include your weight (obesity is a risk factor for thrombosis), tobacco use, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol . Ask your doctor about ways to manage these risks. Understand treatment options. Seek emergency care if you experience any of the symptoms of thrombosis. Immediate treatment with anticoagulants (blood thinners ) won’t get rid of the clot, but can prevent it from getting bigger. New medications, called C5 complement inhibitors, have helped decrease the number of life-threatening thrombosis events in those with PNH. Connect to the community. Support groups of peers with PNH can provide you with comfort and compassion when dealing with a rare disease. Connect with others who have PNH through organizations like the Aplastic Anemia and MDS International Foundation to feel less isolated in your disease-related challenges.	0.9423620700836182	0.7542912364006042	2026-01-26T22:26:59.640304

Your family has a history of ovarian cancer, breast cancer , colon cancer , rectal cancer or uterine cancer . If so, there are tests that can show whether you have certain genes that put you at risk.
You have had breast cancer.
You have a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.
Lynch syndrome runs in your family. This condition can contribute to many kinds of cancer.
You got your first period before you were 12 years old or stopped after you were 52.
You have had estrogen hormone replacement therapy , especially if it was for a long time and in large doses.

There is disagreement as to when a woman should start getting mammograms: Some doctors say age 40; others say not until age 50.

Women aged 45 to 54 should have a mammogram each year and those aged 55 years or older should continue getting mammograms every one to two years. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends routine screening for women starting at 50. If you have a family history of breast cancer, especially in your mother or sister, your doctor may want you to start them earlier. Three-dimensional mammograms, to be used along with traditional digital mammograms, are also available in some screening centers.	0.9478183388710022	0.9957477450370789	2026-01-26T22:27:56.551987
