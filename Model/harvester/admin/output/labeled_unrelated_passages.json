    "text": "Making sure that what you have is RSV usually requires a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test. That involves getting a swab from inside the nose to see if the virus is there. When RSV leads to serious respiratory problems, you may go to the hospital to get oxygen and other urgent care. Dehydration is common with RSV in older adults, so you may need intravenous fluids (in your vein) when you get there. For people with COPD, asthma, or other respiratory conditions, corticosteroids or bronchodilators can help ease the breathing problems that RSV makes worse. Antibiotics are helpful only if you have a bacterial infection in addition to your RSV infection. Sometimes pneumonia can be the result of a bacterial infection. There are three vaccines available for adults of different ages: Arexvy , mResvia , and Abrysvo . These can help prevent serious RSV infection and hospitalization. Even without major health complications, older adults may need more time than younger people to get over RSV. As with cold viruses, there is no specific medication or other treatment for RSV. The usual advice to rest and get plenty of fluids still applies. And an over-the-counter pain reliever and fever reducer can help. But because RSV can lead to very bad health complications in older adults – especially for people with certain other health problems – be aware that your symptoms may be signs of a serious infection that needs medical attention right away.",

There are a couple different types of cholesterol:\nHigh-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or “good” cholesterol. Low levels of HDL cholesterol can contribute to heart disease and other issues, especially if your LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels are high.\nLow-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or “bad” cholesterol. When your LDL cholesterol levels are too high, your arteries can become too narrow and get blocked. That can cause stroke and heart problems.\nTriglycerides are fats from the food you eat that circulate in your body, which can be stored in fat cells.

Bacteria in the mouth convert sugars and carbohydrates from the foods you eat to acids, and it's the acids that begin to attack the enamel on teeth , starting the decay process. Too many carbohydrates from sugars (like cake, cookies and candies) and savory foods and starches (like pretzels and potato chips) can cause tooth decay. The more often you eat and snack, the more frequently you’re exposing your teeth to the cycle of decay. Time between meals allows saliva to wash away food particles that bacteria would otherwise feast on. Frequent snacking, without brushing immediately afterward, gives bacteria constant fuel. Try to limit snacks as much as possible -- no more than one or two a day. Brush teeth after each snack, if possible.",

The more uncontrolled the blood sugar, the more likely dental and oral health problems will arise. This is because uncontrolled diabetes impairs white blood cells, which are the body's main defense against infections that can occur in the mouth. Over time, untreated plaque can lead to tooth decay, gum disease (gingivitis), periodontitis, and tooth loss. So keep an eye out for signs of gum problems, including swollen, tender, or bleeding gums. Whether you have diabetes or not, be sure to brush, floss, and rinse with antiseptic mouthwash daily.

    "text": "Advancing age puts many seniors at risk for a number of oral health problems, such as:\nDarkened teeth . Caused, to some extent, by changes in dentin -- the bone-like tissue that underlies the tooth enamel -- and by a lifetime of consuming stain-causing foods and beverages. Also caused by thinning of the outer enamel layer that lets the darker yellower dentin show through. A darkened tooth or teeth may be a sign of a more serious problem and should be checked by your dentist.\nDry mouth . Caused by reduced saliva flow, which can be a result of cancer treatments that use radiation to the head and neck area, as well as certain diseases, such as Sjögren's syndrome , and medication side effects. Many medicines can cause dry mouth.\nDiminished sense of taste . While advancing age impairs the sense of taste, diseases, medications , and dentures can also contribute to this sensory loss.\nRoot decay . This is caused by exposure of the tooth root to decay-causing acids. The tooth roots become exposed as gum tissue recedes from the tooth . Roots do not have any enamel to protect them and are more prone to decay than the crown part of the tooth.\nGum disease . Caused by plaque and made worse by food left in teeth, use of tobacco products, poor-fitting bridges and dentures, poor diets, and certain diseases, such as anemia , cancer , and diabetes, this is often a problem for older adults.\nTooth loss . Gum disease is a leading cause of tooth loss.\nUneven jawbone . This is caused by tooth and then not replacing missing teeth. This allows the rest of the teeth to drift and shift into open spaces\nDenture-induced stomatitis . Ill-fitting dentures, poor dental hygiene, or a buildup of the fungus Candida albicans cause this condition, which is inflammation of the tissue underlying a denture.\nThrush . Diseases or drugs that affect the immune system can trigger the overgrowth of the fungus Candida albicans in the mouth .",

    "text": "RSV is usually transmitted when someone who has it coughs or sneezes. But it can also survive on certain surfaces for several hours. This means that many of the simple steps you take to lower your risk of getting the flu or other illnesses can be effective RSV prevention steps, too. For example: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough . Disinfect surfaces often, such as counters, doorknobs, drawer and cabinet knobs, toys, and other things your baby touches. Try to keep your baby’s hands from their nose, mouth, and eyes, especially if their hands haven’t been washed recently. Wash your hands and your baby’s hands often with soap and water. Also, if you’re feeling sick, you may also want to consider wearing a face mask around your infant during the first few months after they’re born, especially if it’s during peak RSV season. The same is true for visitors or others who want to hold your baby. If possible, try to keep your child out of day care or other crowded, confined places, at least during the winter months. Breastfeeding your baby may offer RSV protection, too. Research suggests that the complications of RSV – including those that require getting oxygen in the hospital – are less serious in babies who are breastfed compared with those who drink formula only or a combination of breastmilk and formula.",

Smoking irritates your respiratory system and can make it harder to breathe. It raises your chances of COPD and lung cancer. Avoid secondhand smoke, too.\nExercise regularly, which will make your lungs and your heart stronger.\nStay hydrated. Water helps keep your mucus thin, which makes it easier to breathe. Thicker mucus can make you more likely to get an infection.\nGet checkups, so you and your doctor can stay on top of any respiratory problems.\nGet vaccinated. Vaccines can protect you against, COVID-19, the flu, RSV, and pneumonia . Talk to your doctor about which shots you should have. They're especially important if you have a respiratory condition.\nBe aware of outdoor air pollution. Check the air quality where you are and follow recommendations to limit exposure when needed.\nPromote good indoor air quality. Dusting regularly, changing your home's air filters, and keeping cigarette smoke out are a few ways to improve the air in your home.\nTake deep breaths. This can improve your lung function, and it also may help you manage stress.\nWash your hands. It's one of the best ways to avoid the spread of upper respiratory infections.\nAsk about a lung cancer screening. If you're at high risk, this test could make sense for you. Ask your doctor.",

High-intensity aerobic exercise. It gets your heart rate up and improves blood flow. Examples are running, swimming, cycling, and playing tennis. Resistance training. It helps lower body fat and build muscle. Combined with aerobic exercise, it can help raise \"good\" HDL cholesterol and lower \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. Examples are hand weights, resistance bands, and bodyweight exercises. Stretching, balance, and flexibility. Stretching doesn't lower cholesterol or directly improve heart health, but it makes you more flexible and strengthens muscles, which makes aerobic exercise easier. Examples are tai chi and yoga.",

Some common ones are:\nDepression : Depression is a mood disorder that can cause sadness, loss of energy, and fatigue.\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS): People with CFS feel extreme episodes of tiredness that last for a long time and don’t get better with rest. They may not even leave their beds.\nFibromyalgia : This causes widespread pain, memory problems, and mood changes. It can also make you feel exhausted.\nSleep apnea : This happens when something interrupts your breathing while you sleep. It can lead to low energy and daytime sleepiness.\nAnemia : When you don’t have enough healthy red blood cells, your energy levels might fall.\nThyroid disorders : If your thyroid gland doesn’t work like it should, you may feel sluggish.\nDiabetes : High blood sugar levels can zap your energy.\nRestless legs syndrome : This disorder causes you to move your legs while you’re at rest.\nHeart disease: Heart problems can make you more tired than usual.\nSleep disorders: Certain sleep conditions, like insomnia or narcolepsy , can make it hard to wake up in the morning.",

    "text": "Making sure that what you have is RSV usually requires a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test. That involves getting a swab from inside the nose to see if the virus is there. When RSV leads to serious respiratory problems, you may go to the hospital to get oxygen and other urgent care. Dehydration is common with RSV in older adults, so you may need intravenous fluids (in your vein) when you get there. For people with COPD, asthma, or other respiratory conditions, corticosteroids or bronchodilators can help ease the breathing problems that RSV makes worse. Antibiotics are helpful only if you have a bacterial infection in addition to your RSV infection. Sometimes pneumonia can be the result of a bacterial infection. There are three vaccines available for adults of different ages: Arexvy , mResvia , and Abrysvo . These can help prevent serious RSV infection and hospitalization. Even without major health complications, older adults may need more time than younger people to get over RSV. As with cold viruses, there is no specific medication or other treatment for RSV. The usual advice to rest and get plenty of fluids still applies. And an over-the-counter pain reliever and fever reducer can help. But because RSV can lead to very bad health complications in older adults – especially for people with certain other health problems – be aware that your symptoms may be signs of a serious infection that needs medical attention right away.",

They include liquids you drink ( Maalox , Milk of Magnesia , Mylanta ) and chewable tablets ( Rolaids , Tums ). But they won't heal ulcers or fix damage to your esophagus from long-term GERD. Some can cause side effects like constipation or diarrhea.\nH-2 receptor blockers: These work slower than antacids, but they ease symptoms for a longer time, up to 12 hours.

    "text": "There are different types of cholesterol:\nLow-density-lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol, or “bad” cholesterol. When your LDL cholesterol levels are too high, your arteries can become too narrow and get blocked. This can cause stroke and heart problems.\nHigh-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or “good” cholesterol. Low levels of HDL cholesterol can contribute to heart disease and other issues, especially if your LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels are high.\nTriglycerides. These are fats from the food you eat that circulate in your body, which can be stored in fat cells. Triglycerides aren’t actually a type of cholesterol, but their levels are measured along with HDL and LDL to see if you are at risk for, or have, atherosclerosis . (That's when fatty deposits build up in your artery walls, restricting blood flow and leading to a variety of issues like aneurysms and heart attacks.)",

Issues with the central nervous system that may lead to psychosis or delirium include:\nBrain hemorrhage. A brain hemorrhage means bleeding of the brain. Many things can cause brain bleeding including bleeding disorders, clots, head trauma, complications in a pregnancy , and overuse of alcohol or recreational drugs.\nBrain tumor. A brain tumor is a growth of abnormal cells in the brain. There are many types of brain tumors. Some are cancerous, but not all.\nHepatic encephalopathy . Hepatic encephalopathy is a nervous system condition caused by liver disease. If your liver doesn’t work properly, toxins build up within your blood and can make their way to your brain.\nObstructive hydrocephalus. Obstructive hydrocephalus is a condition in which a blockage causes a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid, resulting in increased pressure on the brain.\nSeizure. A seizure is caused by a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance within your brain. There are many types of seizures with many different causes.\nStroke. A stroke occurs when blood supply and nutrients to the brain are cut off, either by a clot or burst blood vessel. There are a few different types of strokes, and these strokes can cause a variety of symptoms and effects.",

    "text": "Often a pregnancy is classified as high risk because of issues that arise from the pregnancy itself and that have little to do with the mother's health. These include:\nPremature labor is labor that begins before 37 weeks of pregnancy. About 12% of babies born in the U.S. are born early. Preemies have higher odds of health problems or developmental delays later on. Although there is no way to know which women will have preterm labor or birth, there are factors that place women at higher risk, such as certain infections, a shortened cervix , or previous preterm birth.\nMultiple births means you are carrying more than one baby (twins, triplets, quadruplets, etc.). Multiple pregnancies, which are more common as women are using more infertility treatments, increase the risk of premature labor, gestational diabetes, and pregnancy-induced high blood pressure. These babies have a higher risk for long-term health problems such as delayed development or cerebral palsy . But keep in mind that most multiples are born healthy.\nPlacenta previa is a condition in which the placenta covers the cervix. The condition can cause bleeding, especially if a woman has contractions. If the placenta still covers the cervix close to delivery, the doctor may schedule a cesarean section to reduce bleeding risks to the mother and baby.\nFetal problems, which can sometimes be seen on ultrasound. Approximately 2% to 3% of all babies have a minor or major structural problem in development. Sometimes there may be a family history of fetal problems, but other times these problems are completely unexpected.",

    "text": "The origins of the two diseases are very different, though. While EoE suggests something allergen-related is happening, scientists believe GERD comes from an injury to the mucous membranes in your esophagus. This might be due to repeated acid reflux -- when stomach acid backs up into your esophagus. GERD also can happen if your lower esophageal sphincter -- where your esophagus meets your stomach and which protects against reflux -- gets weak or relaxes when it shouldn’t. Causes might include being overweight, pregnancy , smoking, or breathing in secondhand smoke. Some medications, like sedatives, asthma meds, or NSAIDs, can cause it, too. . Proton pump inhibitor-responsive esophageal eosinophilia, aka PPI-REE, is so similar to EoE that some researchers view it as a subtype. Proton pump inhibitors, or PPIs, are drugs that reduce stomach acid. They’re a standard treatment for GERD and have been used in the past to tell it apart from EoE because EoE doesn’t always respond to PPIs. But some people with EoE do respond to PPIs; hence the name PPI-REE. For this reason, PPIs have been made part of the treatment. If they don’t work, your doctor can try another approach.",

Other symptoms of an asthma attack can include:\nSevere wheezing when breathing both in and out\nCoughing that won't stop\nVery rapid breathing\nChest tightness or pressure\nTightened neck and chest muscles, called retractions\nDifficulty talking\nFeelings of anxiety or panic\nPale, sweaty face\nBlue lips or fingernails\nWorsening symptoms despite use of your medications",

COPD can also impact other parts of your life. When your lungs and airways don't work properly, it can put limits on the normal daily activities you used to carry out with ease. It can also make you more likely to get certain other illnesses down the line and affect your overall quality of life, especially if symptoms worsen.

However, studies show that poor sleep does increase your risk of both the syndrome and the different conditions that contribute to it. For example, your risk of metabolic syndrome goes up if you get too little or too much sleep each night. Both also raise your risk of obesity and high blood pressure. Too little sleep also comes with a risk of elevated blood sugar. At least one common sleep disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, has been tied to all five components of metabolic syndrome: obesity, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, high blood sugar, and low HDL (“good”) cholesterol.",

Without ergosterol, the yeast cell wall becomes leaky and the yeasts die. Fortunately, ergosterol is not a component of human membranes, and azoles do not harm human cells.\nPolyene antifungal medications include nystatin and amphotericin B. Nystatin is used for thrush and superficial yeast infections. Doctors reserve amphotericin B for more serious systemic fungal infections. The antifungals work by attaching to ergosterol.

If you are HIV -positive or have another immune system disorder, the yeast may also grow uncontrolled.\nSex. Though a yeast infection is not considered a sexually transmitted infection, it can be passed from person to person through sexual contact.\nStress. Research shows that the candida fungus, like other organisms, responds to stress. Our knowledge of this response mostly comes from lab studies where scientists grow it in glucose.

    "text": "When a direct cause for high blood pressure can be identified, the condition is described as secondary hypertension. This type of high blood pressure is caused by a different health condition. It is usually more sudden and severe than essential hypertension. Some causes include:\nKidney disease. This is the most common cause of secondary hypertension.\nAdrenal disorders. Hypertension can also be triggered by tumors or other abnormalities of adrenal glands (small structures that sit atop the kidneys). Adrenal tumors or disorders can cause them to release too much of the hormones that elevate blood pressure.\nThyroid disorders. Too much or too little thyroid hormone can affect your blood pressure.\nCongenital heart defects. Some people are born with heart or blood vessel problems.\nObstructive sleep apnea. This condition causes breathing problems and lack of oxygen. This can harm your arteries.\nBirth control pills. Pills used for birth control (specifically those containing estrogen) and pregnancy can boost blood pressure.\nCough, cold, and pain-relieving medications. These can temporarily raise blood pressure.\nCertain medications. Some drugs can constrict blood vessels, making it harder for the heart to pump blood.\nIllegal drugs. Cocaine and amphetamines can raise blood pressure.",

Make sure to brush along the gum line in addition to your teeth.\nReplace worn-out toothbrushes at least every three to four months because they can injure your gums.\nFloss between teeth or use an interdental cleaner once a day.\nRinse with an antiseptic mouthwash at least once a day.\nSee your dentist for checkups and cleanings two or more times a year. If gums are bleeding , don't wait. See your dentist right away. If you have periodontal disease, the dentist or dental assistant can use deep-cleaning measures or apply antibiotics . If disease is advanced, surgery can clean badly diseased gum pockets.\nKeep your dentist up to date about any changes in your overall health, especially if you are pregnant or entering menopause , or have a disease such as diabetes. In these cases, pay special care to your dental health. You may be more susceptible to gingivitis .\nLimit sugary snacks and drinks.\nEat a balanced diet. A recent study in men age 65 and older showed a special benefit to eating a diet rich in high-fiber fruit. This appears to slow the progression of periodontal disease.\nIf you're a smoker, do everything possible to quit. People who smoke are more likely to have a buildup of plaque and tartar. In fact, smokers may be up to four times more likely to develop advanced periodontal disease than nonsmokers.",

    "text": "Nonsurgical treatments. Some treatments that don't involve surgery include:\nProfessional dental cleaning. During a typical checkup, your dentist or dental hygienist will remove the plaque and tartar (plaque that builds up and hardens on the tooth surface and can only be removed with professional cleaning) from above and below the gumline of your teeth. If you have signs of gum disease, your dentist may recommend professional dental cleaning more than twice a year. These cleanings aren’t treatments for active gum disease. But they’re important preventive measures.\nScaling and root planing. This deep cleaning is done under a local anesthetic. In this procedure, your plaque and tartar from above and below your gumline are scraped away (scaling) and rough spots on your tooth roots are made smooth (planing). Smoothing these rough spots removes bacteria and provides a clean surface for your gums to reattach to your teeth. Scaling and root planing is done if your dentist or periodontist finds you have plaque and calculus (hardened plaque, also called tartar) under your gums that need to be removed.\nMedications . There’s no magic pill or cream that can cure gum disease, Sahl says. Still, your dentist may prescribe medication as part of your treatment. Some options include: Antiseptic chip or antibiotic microspheres: You insert these tiny gels or particles into pockets in your gum, and they release medication slowly over time to help reduce the size of the pocket and get rid of bacteria. Antibiotic gel: You spread this on gum pockets after a deep cleaning to help control infection. Enzyme suppressant: You take this tablet after a deep cleaning to block certain enzymes in your mouth from breaking down gum tissue.",

Doctors think this may be because many conditions that increase blood clotting can make you prone to clotting all over your circulatory system, both in your arteries and your veins. Strokes may cause loss of movement, which is another risk factor for DVT. Immobility can make it harder for you to get enough fluids, causing dehydration – which also raises your odds for DVT.",

If you are fit and did regular exercise before surgery, you may resume exercising when you feel comfortable and your doctor gives the approval. However, strenuous exercise, heavy lifting, and abdominal exercises such as sit-ups should be avoided for six weeks after surgery.",

At the very least, you will likely have to do some range-of-motion exercises so you can use your joint again. Range-of-motion exercises help your joint: Get stronger Increase or improve endurance Maintain and increase its current range-of-motion These exercises can also promote circulation and blood flow to the area. If your surgery was on a weight-bearing joint like your hip or knee, you will need other exercises to make sure you’re up and about again. You might need a special machine called a continuous passive motion (CPM) machine. This is a device that helps your leg move without putting extra pressure on the joint, helping reduce or prevent your joint from becoming stiff and developing scars in the joint – joint adhesions. How your doctor chooses to treat you depends on many factors. Any type of therapy to treat TGCT could cause a complication, but not everyone experiences complications. It's important that you speak with your doctor so you can understand the issues involved and what your risks are so you can make an informed decision.",
