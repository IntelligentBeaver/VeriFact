That involves getting a swab from inside the nose to see if the virus is there. When RSV leads to serious respiratory problems, you may go to the hospital to get oxygen and other urgent care. Dehydration is common with RSV in older adults, so you may need intravenous fluids (in your vein) when you get there. For people with COPD, asthma, or other respiratory conditions, corticosteroids or bronchodilators can help ease the breathing problems that RSV makes worse. Antibiotics are helpful only if you have a bacterial infection in addition to your RSV infection. Sometimes pneumonia can be the result of a bacterial infection. There are three vaccines available for adults of different ages: Arexvy , mResvia , and Abrysvo . These can help prevent serious RSV infection and hospitalization. Even without major health complications, older adults may need more time than younger people to get over RSV. As with cold viruses, there is no specific medication or other treatment for RSV. The usual advice to rest and get plenty of fluids still applies. And an over-the-counter pain reliever and fever reducer can help.

Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or “bad” cholesterol. When your LDL cholesterol levels are too high, your arteries can become too narrow and get blocked. That can cause stroke and heart problems.

Genes. If someone in your family has high cholesterol, you’re more likely to get it too.
Age. Cholesterol tends to get higher over time. That’s because the body has a harder time clearing out cholesterol as you get older.
Sex. Women and people assigned female at birth might see their LDL levels go up after menopause.
Some health conditions. Diabetes, chronic kidney disease, familial hypercholesterolemia, and HIV can lead to high LDL.
Some medications. Certain drugs, especially those used to control blood pressure or HIV, can cause high LDL as a side effect.
Fatty foods. Red and processed meats, full-fat dairy, fast foods, fried foods, and some sweets are high in saturated and trans fats. These fats are known to increase LDL cholesterol.
Lack of exercise. Not getting enough physical activity can cause you to gain weight, which increases your risk for high cholesterol.

Overweight/obesity: If you have extra weight, or a body mass index (BMI) higher than 25, your HDL cholesterol is likely to be lower. In addition, lower levels of HDL cholesterol are associated with obesity, especially fat around the abdomen.

Darkened teeth . Caused, to some extent, by changes in dentin -- the bone-like tissue that underlies the tooth enamel -- and by a lifetime of consuming stain-causing foods and beverages. Also caused by thinning of the outer enamel layer that lets the darker yellower dentin show through. A darkened tooth or teeth may be a sign of a more serious problem and should be checked by your dentist.
Dry mouth . Caused by reduced saliva flow, which can be a result of cancer treatments that use radiation to the head and neck area, as well as certain diseases, such as Sjögren's syndrome , and medication side effects. Many medicines can cause dry mouth.
Diminished sense of taste . While advancing age impairs the sense of taste, diseases, medications , and dentures can also contribute to this sensory loss.
Root decay . This is caused by exposure of the tooth root to decay-causing acids. The tooth roots become exposed as gum tissue recedes from the tooth . Roots do not have any enamel to protect them and are more prone to decay than the crown part of the tooth.
Gum disease . Caused by plaque and made worse by food left in teeth, use of tobacco products, poor-fitting bridges and dentures, poor diets, and certain diseases, such as anemia , cancer , and diabetes, this is often a problem for older adults.
Tooth loss . Gum disease is a leading cause of tooth loss.
Uneven jawbone . This is caused by tooth and then not replacing missing teeth. This allows the rest of the teeth to drift and shift into open spaces
Denture-induced stomatitis . Ill-fitting dentures, poor dental hygiene, or a buildup of the fungus Candida albicans cause this condition, which is inflammation of the tissue underlying a denture.
Thrush . Diseases or drugs that affect the immune system can trigger the overgrowth of the fungus Candida albicans in the mouth .",0.9383295774459839,0.0002037356171058491,2026-01-26T22:07:19.200245

Don't smoke. Smoking irritates your respiratory system and can make it harder to breathe. It raises your chances of COPD and lung cancer. Avoid secondhand smoke, too.
Exercise regularly, which will make your lungs and your heart stronger.
Stay hydrated. Water helps keep your mucus thin, which makes it easier to breathe. Thicker mucus can make you more likely to get an infection.
Get checkups, so you and your doctor can stay on top of any respiratory problems.
Get vaccinated. Vaccines can protect you against, COVID-19, the flu, RSV, and pneumonia . Talk to your doctor about which shots you should have. They're especially important if you have a respiratory condition.
Be aware of outdoor air pollution. Check the air quality where you are and follow recommendations to limit exposure when needed.
Promote good indoor air quality. Dusting regularly, changing your home's air filters, and keeping cigarette smoke out are a few ways to improve the air in your home.
Take deep breaths. This can improve your lung function, and it also may help you manage stress.
Wash your hands. It's one of the best ways to avoid the spread of upper respiratory infections.

Dehydration is common with RSV in older adults, so you may need intravenous fluids (in your vein) when you get there. For people with COPD, asthma, or other respiratory conditions, corticosteroids or bronchodilators can help ease the breathing problems that RSV makes worse. Antibiotics are helpful only if you have a bacterial infection in addition to your RSV infection. Sometimes pneumonia can be the result of a bacterial infection. There are three vaccines available for adults of different ages: Arexvy , mResvia , and Abrysvo . These can help prevent serious RSV infection and hospitalization.

Premature labor is labor that begins before 37 weeks of pregnancy. About 12% of babies born in the U.S. are born early. Preemies have higher odds of health problems or developmental delays later on. Although there is no way to know which women will have preterm labor or birth, there are factors that place women at higher risk, such as certain infections, a shortened cervix , or previous preterm birth.
Multiple births means you are carrying more than one baby (twins, triplets, quadruplets, etc.). Multiple pregnancies, which are more common as women are using more infertility treatments, increase the risk of premature labor, gestational diabetes, and pregnancy-induced high blood pressure. These babies have a higher risk for long-term health problems such as delayed development or cerebral palsy . But keep in mind that most multiples are born healthy.
Placenta previa is a condition in which the placenta covers the cervix. The condition can cause bleeding, especially if a woman has contractions. If the placenta still covers the cervix close to delivery, the doctor may schedule a cesarean section to reduce bleeding risks to the mother and baby.
Fetal problems, which can sometimes be seen on ultrasound. Approximately 2% to 3% of all babies have a minor or major structural problem in development.

While EoE suggests something allergen-related is happening, scientists believe GERD comes from an injury to the mucous membranes in your esophagus. This might be due to repeated acid reflux -- when stomach acid backs up into your esophagus. GERD also can happen if your lower esophageal sphincter -- where your esophagus meets your stomach and which protects against reflux -- gets weak or relaxes when it shouldn’t. Causes might include being overweight, pregnancy , smoking, or breathing in secondhand smoke. Some medications, like sedatives, asthma meds, or NSAIDs, can cause it, too. . Proton pump inhibitor-responsive esophageal eosinophilia, aka PPI-REE, is so similar to EoE that some researchers view it as a subtype. Proton pump inhibitors, or PPIs, are drugs that reduce stomach acid. They’re a standard treatment for GERD and have been used in the past to tell it apart from EoE because EoE doesn’t always respond to PPIs. But some people with EoE do respond to PPIs; hence the name PPI-REE. For this reason, PPIs have been made part of the treatment.

Azole medications are a family of antifungal drugs that end in the suffix ""-azole."" They block the manufacture of ergosterol, a crucial material of the yeast cell wall. Without ergosterol, the yeast cell wall becomes leaky and the yeasts die. Fortunately, ergosterol is not a component of human membranes, and azoles do not harm human cells.
Polyene antifungal medications include nystatin and amphotericin B. Nystatin is used for thrush and superficial yeast infections. Doctors reserve amphotericin B for more serious systemic fungal infections. The antifungals work by attaching to ergosterol.

Hormones. Changes during pregnancy , breastfeeding, or menopause (or if you’re taking birth control pills) can change the balance in your vagina.
Diabetes. If your diabetes is not well-controlled, the increase in sugar in the mucous membranes of your vagina can create a place for yeast to grow.

Douches and vaginal sprays. The use of these products can change the balance in your vagina.
A weakened immune system. If you are HIV -positive or have another immune system disorder, the yeast may also grow uncontrolled.
Sex. Though a yeast infection is not considered a sexually transmitted infection, it can be passed from person to person through sexual contact.
Stress. Research shows that the candida fungus, like other organisms, responds to stress. Our knowledge of this response mostly comes from lab studies where scientists grow it in glucose.

Here are the basics:
Brush your teeth twice daily with fluoride toothpaste. Make sure to brush along the gum line in addition to your teeth.
Replace worn-out toothbrushes at least every three to four months because they can injure your gums.
Floss between teeth or use an interdental cleaner once a day.
Rinse with an antiseptic mouthwash at least once a day.
See your dentist for checkups and cleanings two or more times a year. If gums are bleeding , don't wait. See your dentist right away. If you have periodontal disease, the dentist or dental assistant can use deep-cleaning measures or apply antibiotics . If disease is advanced, surgery can clean badly diseased gum pockets.
Keep your dentist up to date about any changes in your overall health, especially if you are pregnant or entering menopause , or have a disease such as diabetes. In these cases, pay special care to your dental health. You may be more susceptible to gingivitis .
Limit sugary snacks and drinks.
Eat a balanced diet. A recent study in men age 65 and older showed a special benefit to eating a diet rich in high-fiber fruit. This appears to slow the progression of periodontal disease.
If you're a smoker, do everything possible to quit. People who smoke are more likely to have a buildup of plaque and tartar.

Wyatt Jr., DMD",2025-01-29,"Nonsurgical treatments. Some treatments that don't involve surgery include:
Professional dental cleaning. During a typical checkup, your dentist or dental hygienist will remove the plaque and tartar (plaque that builds up and hardens on the tooth surface and can only be removed with professional cleaning) from above and below the gumline of your teeth. If you have signs of gum disease, your dentist may recommend professional dental cleaning more than twice a year. These cleanings aren’t treatments for active gum disease. But they’re important preventive measures.
Scaling and root planing. This deep cleaning is done under a local anesthetic. In this procedure, your plaque and tartar from above and below your gumline are scraped away (scaling) and rough spots on your tooth roots are made smooth (planing). Smoothing these rough spots removes bacteria and provides a clean surface for your gums to reattach to your teeth. Scaling and root planing is done if your dentist or periodontist finds you have plaque and calculus (hardened plaque, also called tartar) under your gums that need to be removed.
Medications . There’s no magic pill or cream that can cure gum disease, Sahl says. Still, your dentist may prescribe medication as part of your treatment. Some options include: Antiseptic chip or antibiotic microspheres: You insert these tiny gels or particles into pockets in your gum, and they release medication slowly over time to help reduce the size of the pocket and get rid of bacteria. Antibiotic gel: You spread this on gum pockets after a deep cleaning to help control infection. Enzyme suppressant: You take this tablet after a deep cleaning to block certain enzymes in your mouth from breaking down gum tissue.",0.9418932199478149,0.032498713582754135,2026-01-26T22:26:49.161692
