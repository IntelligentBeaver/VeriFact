There’s no indication that Jeanne         Phillips, who writes Dear Abby, authenticated the story, but if it is         true, it may be describing an allergic reaction such as to mold, which         could have developed in the pancake mix. If so, it’s not a         condition uniquely associated with pancake mixes but one that could         develop in many foods and does not normally affect healthy people, only         those with severe allergic reactions to various kinds of molds. The woman in the article refers to a 19-year-old who died from eating         pancakes from an outdated mix. That is probably in reference to a report         from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner Department of Pathology         and Laboratory Medicine, Forensic Section Medical University of South         Carolina, Charleston. It tells of an anaphylactic reaction in a         19-year-old who was known to have allergic reactions to a variety of         substances. He and his friends ate some pancakes made from a mix         that had been opened and sitting on a shelf for approximately 2         years. Two of the friends stopped eating the pancakes because they         didn’t like the taste. The 19-year-old continued eating, started         experiencing shortness of breath, and later died at a nearby clinic. Last updated 5/11/06   Comments",

    "claim": "The eRumor is based on a March   11, 2010 article the in C-Fam website called “Girl Scouts Distribute   Planned Parenthood Sex Guide at UN Meeting.” It was written by Terrence   McKeegan, J.D. C-Fam is the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute   based out of New York and Washington D.C. and the story was based on the   written account in the    Daily Caller by Sharon Slater of Family Watch International who said   she discovered the controversial brochure on a table in the back of the   room after the girl’s workshop. The brochure in   question is called “Healthy, Happy and Hot – a Young Person’s’ Guide to   Their Rights, Sexuality and Living with HIV” and is a sort of primer for   young single or married people who living with AIDS or HIV. A spokesperson for The   Girls Scouts of the USA told TruthOrFiction.Com, however, that the   allegations that the brochure was a part of the Girl Scouts meeting are   false. The spokesperson   confirmed that there was an event in 2010 at the United Nations where   members of the Girl Scouts organization were in attendance for a   workshop hosted by Girl Scouts of the USA, UNICEF’s Working Group on   Girls, Girls Learn International and The Grail but no one was handed any   brochures on sexuality or by Planned Parenthood. The Girl Scouts of the   USA sent us this statement:  Last year, Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) was honored to attend and   participate in the 54th Commission on the Status of Women at the United   Nations, where girls were encouraged to take action on global issues   concerning women and girls. Our participation in that conference was   recently the subject of numerous internet stories and blogs that are   factually inaccurate and troubling. Here are the facts of that meeting:   * The Girls Only   Workshop was jointly hosted by Girl Scouts of the USA, UNICEF’s Working   Group on Girls, Girls Learn International and The Grail. The meeting was   only open to the girls and participating sponsors. * Only seven adults   were in the room at the time of the meeting, each representing one of   the sponsors of the event. No one from Catholic Family & Human Rights   Institute was in the room to report on the event. * 30 – 35 girls   from across the world participated in this event. All teenagers. * The girls   received a copy of the only document they were working on titled (“The   Girls’ Statement”). No other documents were given to the girls as part   of this event. * The room in   question was also used to host other events over the course of the   multi-day conference. Prior to our girls entering the room, we did not   “sanitize’ the room to ensure that no trash or other items were left   behind. We did request that those not associated with the sponsors leave   the room prior to our session. * The Girl Scouts   of the USA was not contacted by Catholic Family & Human Rights Institute   (C-FAM) regarding its initial story to discuss the facts of this event. Had they applied these basic journalistic standards, perhaps the true   details of this event would have been reported. Our Mission in Girl   Scouting is to build girls of courage, confidence and character – who   make the world a better place. We continue to be proud of our girls and   look forward to showing the world what our girls can do. We thank   everyone for their support of Girl Scouting. The spokesperson also   added that “Girl Scouts does not take a position on abortion or birth   control. The national umbrella organization, Girl Scouts of the USA does   not have a relationship with Planned Parenthood on a national level and   does not plan to have one.” updated 02/10/10 Comments",

    "claim": "It is apparently true that Francoise             Gaellar did receive a transplanted kidney on September 2, 1997, two             days after Princess Diana died as the result of an automobile             accident in Paris. None of the authorities will confirm that any organs were taken from             Diana’s body and they have tried to downplay the woman’s claims. But she says she’s got a “belief” that the kidney she             received is from Princess Diana and it’s become a matter of belief             among the citizens of the small village where she lives as to             whether it’s true. She compiles several pieces of evidence. She says that her doctor told her she would need a kidney from a             donor roughly her size and age. Diana was 36 and 5′ 10″ when she died. Gaellar 38 and 5′ 8″. She says that she was hospitalized and gravely ill when on the             morning of 9/2/04 she was taken by ambulance to a hospital where the             transplant was to take place and that the ambulance driver joked             with her that she was going to be getting a kidney from Princess Di             and that she would have “royal blood.”             Then the hospital staff hinted that she was getting Diana’s kidney             and told her to keep it secret. She claims that ever since the transplant she’s found herself with a             propensity to speak English more frequently than before. An article in the London Daily Mail quotes experts who say such             events have been reported in the past. The article cites the case of an 18-year-old girl who had a heart             transplant from an 18-year-old musician and poet and the girl             suddenly developed a passion for music and poetry. It is claimed that when she met the boy’s parents, she could finish             phrases of some of the lyrics. French law prohibits any information about transplant donors from             being revealed to the transplant recipients. Last updated 5/23/05  Comments",

Only three of the children born to Maria Magdalena Beethoven             survived infancy, with the composer Ludvig Von  Beethoven being the oldest of             the three. Beethoven himself suffered from deafness in adulthood, but we found             no evidence of deaf, blind, or mentally retarded siblings as             children. We found no substantiation of Beethoven’s mother having had             syphilis. She is said to have died of what at that time was called consumption             or tuberculosis. Regarding candidate A, Franklin Roosevelt, there is talk among             astrologers that he consulted with astrologer Evangeline Adams, but             we have not been able to document that. We don’t know how many mistresses Franklin Roosevelt had but he had             an affair with his wife’s social secretary Lucy Page Mercer. She was with him when he died in 1945 in Warm Springs, Georgia. He did like his martinis and is credited with having been the first             to mix a martini in the White House and was a smoker. Regarding candidate B, Winston Churchill, according to             WinstonChurchill.org, he was known for his drinking. We could not find whether he used opium in college. Regarding candidate C, Adolph Hitler, it is true that there is no             evidence that he ever cheated on his wife but that’s primarily             because he was married to her for a few hours before both of them             committed suicide. Hitler’s and his longtime mistress Eva Braun got married early in             the morning on April 29, 1945. At about 3:30 the next afternoon, both took cyanide although Hitler             also shot himself in the head. Hitler preferred a vegetarian diet, but was not a pure vegetarian. It started when his doctor once put him on a vegetarian menu but             Hitler is described by his biographers as liking a variety of meats             including sausages. There is no record of Hitler having smoked or been a user of alcohol             and, in fact, he campaigned against the use of tobacco among his             troops. Comments",

It’s in the form of an appeal from the American Family Association             urging citizens to complain to the FCC and to members of congress.",

    "claim": "An Federal Communications Commission (FCC) decision about a             particular occurrence of the F-word on a telecast has sparked controversy,             but it isn’t accurate to say that the FCC has approved blanket use             of the F-word on radio and television. On April 1, 2013 the FCC released a public notice requesting comments   regarding their indecency policies. Click for statement. Currently, the FCC has   a    guideline posted on their website stressing that content is   important to whether or not they will pursue a broadcaster for   violations. The guideline said, “It is a violation of federal law   to air obscene programming at any time. It is also a violation of   federal law to air indecent programming or profane language during   certain hours. Congress has given the Federal Communications Commission   (FCC) the responsibility for administratively enforcing these laws. The   FCC may revoke a station license, impose a monetary forfeiture or issue   a warning if a station airs obscene, indecent or profane material.” It was during the Golden Globes Awards telecast on January 19, 2003             that Bono of the band U2 told the audience “this is really,             really, f___ing brilliant”” The FCC said the comment was             also reported as “this is f___ing great.” There were numerous complaints. The FCC issued a ruling that said Bono used the word as an adjective             and not to describe sexual or excretory organs or activities, which             is the FCC’s key test for broadcast indecency. In it’s ruling, the FCC said that such “fleeting and isolated             remarks of this nature do not warrant Commission action.” Still, critics are saying that even the use of the F-word as an             adjective has not been that common on broadcasts, primarily because             of fear of running afoul of the FCC and they fear this will mark a             change. The FCC responds to complaints of viewers and listeners and rulings             regarding objectionable words and scenes have been made before,             especially about radio programs. An FCC decision is not the only one affecting what is broadcast. There are also local or state laws that are a part of the picture as             well as the decisions and standards of broadcast organizations…not             to mention the public.

    "claim": "There was no such Associated Press Story and   all indications lead us to believe that this was an April Fools Joke in   2009. This hoax that first appeared on   April 1, 2009 has had a few modifications over the years and refuses to die. There was a court case on   January 24, 2010 in Southern   California’s Santa Ana Supreme Court filed by attorney  Orly Taitz  but Judge David O.   Carter, who presided over the case, dismissed it. In a written   statement, Carter said that the court cannot “sweep away the votes of   over 68 million Americans with the stroke of a pen, ” and “that the U.S.   Constitution does not give the court jurisdiction to decide the matter.”     An Occidental College spokesperson told TruthorFiction.com that   President Obama’s records are still sealed and no such transcripts have   been released. When asked if the future President used the Obama or   Soetoro name at the college, the spokesperson said that although he had   not seen the sealed transcripts he had seen a 1981 photo book that was   handed out to students and faculty at the beginning of the college year   with student photos, names and hometown information. The 1981 photo book   had “Barack Obama” under the student’s photo and indicated a home state   as Hawaii. There is no “Fulbright Foundation” but there is a Fulbright program that   is sponsored by the US Department of State and does award scholarship   grants to students working towards higher degrees who already have a   Bachelor of Arts degree. The program was established in 1946 under   legislation introduced by late Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas   and each year awards approximately 7,500 grants. The grants are for both   American students who want to study abroad and foreign students who want   to study in the US. To be eligible certain criteria must be met. Below is the original 2009 version of this email as appeared on April   First 2009: April 1, 2009 AP- WASHINGTON D.C. – In a move certain to fuel the   debate over Obama’s qualifications for the presidency, the group   “Americans for Freedom of Information” has released copies of President   Obama’s college transcripts from Occidental College. Released today, the   transcript indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received   financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate at   the school. The transcript was released by Occidental College in   compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the   Superior Court of California. The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro)   applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign   students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program. To qualify,   for the scholarship, a student must claim foreign citizenship. This   document would seem to provide the smoking gun that many of Obama’s   detractors have been seeking. The news has created a firestorm at the White House as the release casts   increasing doubt about Obama’s legitimacy and qualification to serve as   president. When reached for comment in London, where he has been in   meetings with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Obama smiled but   refused comment on the issue. Meanwhile, White House press secretary   Robert Gibbs scoffed at the report stating that this was obviously   another attempt by a right-wing conservative group to discredit the   president and undermine the administration’s efforts to move the country   in a new direction. Britain’s Daily Mail has also carried the story in a front-page article   titled, “Obama Eligibility Questioned”, leading some to speculate that   the story may overshadow economic issues on Obama’s first official visit   to the U.K. In a related matter, under growing pressure from several groups, Justice   Antonin Scalia announced that the Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to   hear arguments concerning Obama’s legal eligibility to serve as   President in a case brought by Leo Donofrio of New Jersey. This lawsuit   claims Obama’s dual citizenship disqualified him from serving as   president. Donofrio’s case is just one of 18 suits brought by citizens   demanding proof of Obama’s citizenship or qualification to serve as   president. Gary Kreep of the United States Justice Foundation has released the   results of their investigation of Obama’s campaign spending. This study   estimates that Obama has spent upwards of $950,000 in campaign funds in   the past year with eleven law firms in 12 states for legal resources to   block disclosure of any of his personal records. Mr. Kreep indicated   that the investigation is still ongoing but that the final report will   be provided to the U.S. attorney general, Eric Holder. Mr. Holder has   refused to comment on the matter. TruthOrFiction.Com has a complete page on the questionable citizenship   of Barack Obama with photos of documents.
